This same pattern holds for economists in developing countries. The policy space has been restricted by this revolving door between national and international roles, because it forces a homogenisation of economic perspectives. There is need for a professional code of ethics providing guidelines for disclosure, but such codes may not be sufficient to address many questions, which may be best dealt with through a professional field of ethics in economics.

The sector's performance has been about the same before and after the economic reforms in the early 1990s. The reforms that brought a dramatic acceleration of growth in urban sectors have essentially had no effect on agriculture. Slow agricultural growth has had ill-effects on food security, food price inflation and poverty reduction because of the inadequate level and composition of public expenditure. Agricultural education, research, extension and a wide range of ancillary public institutions have also suffered. Agricultural growth always demands massive public goods provision and that in turn requires a radical reorientation of central, state and district government activities. This paper advocates a new integrated, technology-led strategy to pull out of, what looks like, a vicious circle that agriculture is now caught in.

The media is a significant source of information: out of 27 meetings in which villagers speak up, the media is cited in nine. But the "thinness" of information on entitlements in the media makes it easy for gram panchayat members to refute legitimate claims. The information deficit in the public sphere, arising from media apathy and political collusion, translates into inability of the poor to assess local governments. While the role of the media in strengthening the functioning of electoral democracy is acknowledged, media indifference to deliberative democracy limits poor people's capacity to translate immediate demands for goods and services to aspirations for a good life.

It explores the various arguments - shared ethnicity, irredentist tendencies, lack of international involvement, and the need to tip the balance of power against Pakistan-to understand the motivations behind India's apparent aggressive behaviour, as deemed by the international community at the time. By analysing the speeches of the key actors and reactions of ordinary men and women, it is argued that the lack of international interest and the heavy burden that India faced due to the 10 million refugees it hosted explain the timing of and impetus for military intervention, an action with repercussions that are experienced even today.

This paper analyses the politics of Punjabi Hindus from the early 1920s onwards to suggest that their many schemes for partitioning the Punjab coexisted with demands for separate electorates and reservations for minorities. Partition, however, was not as deadly and tormented a proposal in the 1920s as it became two decades later. The critical, operative factor was safeguarding minority rights and, in striking contrast to contemporary debates in Europe, did not entail population transfers.

A paradigm shift in the way we understand, represent and experience the world subserves a new and aggressive corporate teleology. Technological convergence and digitisation, which held an initial promise of and potential for democratisation, collapse into vertical integration and monopolisation. In the process, cultural sovereignty is abstracted into a homogenised, make-believe, global marketplace, which reduces every individual to a consumer and excludes the real and abiding concerns of vast swathes of humanity. An intellectual resurgence must counter the counterfeit revolution of the information era.

Investigating strategies of being and belonging deployed by the urban poor in the Delhi basti of Nangla Matchi, which was demolished in 2006, this paper explores three varied individual biographies as sites of meanings regarding processes of the state, the unstable contexts of livelihoods, and histories of intra-national displacement. The paper also seeks to make an ethnographic contribution to studies of the urban margins by examining the overlapping careers of "margin" and "centre" as cultural, political and economic contexts. The life-stories described in this paper thus concern the ways in which the metropolises of power, comfort, pleasure, and hygiene are built over and through the provinces of powerlessness, pain, suffering and displacement.

This meant that analyses shifted away from labour, production relations and surplus value extraction typically grounded in Marxian modes of analysis, in favour of those focused on environmental sustainability, livelihood sustainability and a discourse on poverty. During this period, women's labour has been mobilised at an unprecedented scale and concentrated in the most exploitative jobs to fuel economic growth in fisheries. Even as industrial fisheries thrive on the labour of poor women, new analyses and new forms of organising are needed to fundamentally challenge this exploitation. Capital cannot be left unfettered to do as it pleases, but must be forced through stringent regulation to heed other considerations apart from profitability alone. Donor aid is, however, driving the non-governmental organisation increasingly towards conciliatory, mediatory roles, incapable of seeking solutions outside the framework of capital.

Pakistan's modernity is structured along two axes: neo-liberal nationalism and right-wing radical nationalism. While the neo-liberal nationalism axis depicts an authoritarian and top-down model of economic and political development marked with the expansion of a national security-obsessed middle class and ruling elite, the right-wing radical nationalism axis denotes the growth of religious radicalism and militancy as symbols of geopolitical modernity that are anti-imperialist in nature. This analysis argues that liberalism is one of the many consequences of modernity, but not the only one. The meeting point of both trajectories has resulted in turning Pakistan into a hybrid-theocratic state which encapsulates a mix of economic neo-liberalism, pockets of social liberalism, formal theocracy and larger spaces experiencing informal theocracy.

It delineates how the riverbed has changed from being a neglected "non-place" to prized real estate for private and public corporations. It argues that the transformation of an urban commons into a commodity is not only embedded in processes of political economy, but is also driven by aesthetic sensibilities that shape how ecological landscapes are valued. However, the commodification of the riverbed must confront the fact that the Yamuna is an ecological entity with dynamics that can defy attempts at domestication.

In Indian cities unprecedented and unregulated growth, incremental land use change, privatisation and chaotic civic infrastructure provisioning are fracturing resources created over centuries and reducing the right to the city to mere right to housing and property, thus short-changing the concept's transformative potential. Urban actors need to draw inspiration from the way social movements world over including in India have deployed the notion of the commons as a defence against corporate exploitation of biodiversity. Envisioning the right to the city as the fundamental human right, a demand for a just and sustainable social order where collective resources are respected and regenerated to support life, entails a democratic approach to the creation of knowledge about our cities. Such knowledge creation is necessarily a collaborative effort involving citizens who are differentially located in relation to the commons -policymakers, neighbourhood residents, workers and academic researchers.

Communities that were dependent on particular commons could become less dependent, or abandon those commons. New communities of interest might emerge. Examining the transformation of a lake in Bangalore, this paper argues that in the community struggle towards creating and claiming commons, claiming the sphere of planning is fundamental. Further, the making or unmaking of the commons involves the making or unmaking of communities and vice versa. In the case of the Rajapalaya Lake studied here, this occurred and occurs at the interface where democratic struggles and bureaucratic systems meet.

Popular Telugu cinema is replete with examples of the crowd and what cinema does with it. This phenomenon of constituting and naming social formations and the misrecognitions it gives rise to are most instructive in a discussion of the urban commons. This paper analyses Eenadu, a 1982 Telugu film that is centrally concerned with crowds, to illustrate how cinema brings the mass gathered before the screen face-to-face with a version of itself on the screen, framing a new mode of political participation pivoted on the popular appeal of larger-than-life superstars.

The term social exclusion is multidimensional although its western use in a selective way about markets promoting equality separates it from the Indian emphasis on social justice as linked to ending discrimination of dalit groups. The concept of social exclusion is inherently problematic as it faces three major challenges in India: the first relates to the historical discrimination of certain groups and their exclusion; the second is about the political economy of the excluded; and the third questions the way in which equality responses are restricted within the framework of social exclusion.
Vol. 46, No. 50 (DECEMBER 10, 2011)||special articles||The Crowding-Out Effect of Foreign Capital||AJIT K GHOSE||The inflow of foreign private capital to developing countries increased rapidly in the 1990s, but the result was growth of foreign currency reserves and not investment rates. This suggests that capital inflow actually crowded out domestic investment, thereby generating a surplus of domestic saving in recipient countries. This paper seeks to explain why such crowding-out might occur. A simple open-economy model is developed to show that crowding-out can be seen as an unavoidable consequence of substantial capital inflow, and that growth of foreign currency reserves is a corollary of crowding-out. The implication is that by allowing unrestricted inflow of foreign private capital, developing countries do not augment investment. They end up undermining their domestic investors, lending their own savings to developed countries and increasing their dependence on foreign investors for sustaining economic growth. Maintaining controls on capital flows is a good policy stance.

This paper endeavours to provide empirical evidence to this question based on five case studies: three compulsory mergers and two voluntary mergers of recent origin. An index of stock success and an index of flow success assess the performance impact on the balance sheets and income of these banks. There is evidence that one of the transferee banks associated with a compulsory merger appears to have registered underperformance after the event, though there are incipient signs of turnaround in the recent period.

Based on these findings, the paper concludes that the approach adopted by the Reserve Bank of India delivered value to the banking sector.

However, corporate hospitals handle the biggest share of the cases and there is no provision for outpatient treatment of everyday illnesses that affect the working capacity of the patient. The focus on tertiary healthcare to the exclusion of all other forms of medical assistance leads to an inefficient medical care model with a low level of real impact on meeting the needs of healthcare and the health of the population. There is need for a debate on the healthcare and technocommercial performance of the programme, especially if it is going to be copied by other states and even by the centre in introducing some form of universal healthcare.

These concerns are the relationship between faith and modernity and that between revelation, plurality of beliefs and culture which have led toa number of political positions. This paper highlights the features of six influential positions through the writings of one significant thinker from each tradition. Every one of these thinkers responded differently to two overarching concerns. They either engaged with the philosophical principles of modernity, or thought that modernity as a set of skills could be grafted onto the foundational principles of Islam or that a different world could be created by picking out the principles ingrained in the Islamic tradition.

The escalating military budget in the country during the civil war years between 1983 and the present has compensated for the contraction of the State due to market liberalisation and thus made the reform agenda politically viable.

Hence, examining market concentration on the basis of the conventional indices may result in misleading conclusions and hence guide policy formulations in wrong directions.

Liberalisation of the economy has created for this class an excitement of many kinds. It has meant the freedom to pursue the quest for wealth without guilt and, at the same time, it has meant feeling set adrift from tradition and the culture it signifies. Life under the regime of liberalisation has also meant seceding from the physical spaces that constitute the shared habitation of the rich and the poor, by creating selfenclosed townships.

In regulating the sector, there is need for caution in setting interest rate ceilings on micro-loans and for greater openness to microsavings products.

Over the last decade, a number of PPPS providing maternal health services have come into existence but few have been evaluated. This paper examines whether PPPS with the for-profit private sector which provide maternal health services have contributed or are likely to contribute to making quality maternal health services accessible at affordable prices to the poor and marginalised sections of the population, as envisaged by policymakers. The limited evidence indicates that they have not increased either availability or physical access to services for a vast majority of women living in rural areas. The investment of substantial government and donor resources in PPPS without robust evidence on their contribution to reduction of maternal mortality does not appear justified.

This development hinges on the Lockean and Rousseauian "pedagogy of play" and how it has determined the emergence and growth of the "permissible" and the "prohibited" in a child's world. Locke and Rousseau's imageries of childhood had a profound impact on 18th and 19th century discourses on childhood and children's literature in Europe. The paper presents a detailed analysis of the development of respectable, modern, middle-class children's literature of the time.
Vol. 46, No. 48 (NOVEMBER 26, 2011)||special articles||Development of What? On the Politics of Development Economics||ARUP MAHARATNA||It could possibly be sheer historical coincidence that development economics as a distinct branch of economics was born at a time when the cold war was blossoming. But the question as to what has subsequently happened to the fate of the sub-field along with the trajectory of the cold war - the great "intangible" battle fought mainly in the spheres of ideology, economics, politics and propaganda between the capitalist and socialist blocs - cannot be similarly left as a historic fluke. A detailed substantive academic attempt at examining/establishing the latter apprehension has so far remained suspended or sometimes just taken for granted in most retrospective accounts of development economics. This paper makes a systematic study of the issue and argues that the evolution of development economics has been heavily mediated by international politics and that development economics, as it exists in the post-cold war era, entails a great delusion in relation to its original purpose, promise and priorities.

With no choice left, the Government of India has to come to terms with its constitutional responsibility of preserving the treasure in a museum under the temple with the highest safety measures.

The unfolding political scenario in Karnataka calls for a return to its founding moments as a linguistic state. In the early 1950s, Kengal Hanumanthaiah developed the idea of a "composite state" partly in order to channelise the discontent within Mysore about the possible loss of (caste) power but equally to provide an alternative matrix (that of development) within the expanded state. What were the roots of that alternative to the (linguistic) state that was being imagined, and have the recent political developments been a realisation of that imagined "composite state" or its demise? This article attempts to frame these questions through a return to the legislative assembly debates of the early 1950s.

This fact has important consequences for household living standards. In this paper the author explores significant changes in the 1990s and early 2000s that appear to have occurred as a result of out-of-pocket spending on healthcare in 16 Indian states. Using data from the National Sample Survey on consumption expenditure undertaken in 1993-94 and 2004-05, the author measures catastrophic payments and impoverishment due to out-of-pocket payments for healthcare. Considerable data on the magnitude, distribution and economic consequences of out-of-pocket payments in India are provided; when compared over the study period, these indicate that new policies have significantly increased both catastrophic expenditure and impoverishment.

This has produced two reactions: on the one side, heavy lobbying by banking and financial firms to block reforms and weaken enforcement. On the other side, a campaign by some northern NGOS, one or two members of the World Trade Organisation, and the latest by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, about the General Agreement on Trade in Services posing impediments for reform and the need for rule changes to overcome them. This paper finds the campaign to change GATS misguided and meritless. The GATS provides near-total freedom to regulate the financial services sector for prudential reasons and to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system. The changes being proposed will be against developing country interests, mess up the GATS and impact its integrity as a viable trade agreement.

The revival of the PDS can be traced, in large part, to a renewed political interest which manifests itself in state initiatives such as expanded coverage, reduced prices, computerisation of stock management, etc. A large majority of the respondents preferred to receive in-kind food transfers rather than cash transfers, except in Bihar where the PDS is still in very poor shape. Their testimonies, and the survey findings, point to many good reasons to be wary of a hasty transition to cash transfers. Further improving the PDS seems like a more sensible way forward.

Revisiting the Sino-Indian Conflict of 1962||RAMACHANDRA GUHA||Nearly 50 years ago, India and China met in a brief, bloody border clash. This essay analyses that conflict in terms of its impact on the legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru. It explains the roots of Nehru's interest in China, his hopes for relations between the two new nations, the origins of the border dispute, and its escalation into a full-fledged war. Nehru's policies are assessed from the viewpoint of his critics and admirers. The deeper structural reasons for the conflict between India and China are analysed. Finally, the essay also speaks to the shadow cast by the war of 1962 on the geopolitics of the present day.

This is one of various trends that are fast converging on the central Asian chessboard, and the Afghan endgame has given an impetus to the contending powers — regional as well as extra-regional — to take an early lead or to secure advantageous positions. The new India-Afghanistan strategic pact must be seen in this context and it is likely to be followed soon by another between the US and Afghanistan.

"Inclusionary housing" offers a set of policies to meet this need. Its central feature is that whenever any new floor space is built, for whatever reason, a portion of the built space is set aside for housing those who cannot afford what the market offers by way of rental or ownership housing. Building such accommodation is the responsibility of the developer; managing it thereafter is in the hands of a different agency, and subsidising the families that live there is a third function separated from the first two.

An impression has been created as if the adoption of Bt cotton necessitates the use of hybrids. This is an illusion created by the private sector to extract surplus through the sale of seed. This is in sharp contrast to the spread of Bt cotton elsewhere in the world where no hybrids are used. The strategy adopted by the private sector is rendering farmers' rights in seed infructuous and it throws a serious challenge to the public sector to provide an alternative in terms of varieties.

Such accidents could release sufficient energy to fracture the protective barriers around the core, including the containment building, and release large fractions of the radioactive material in the reactor into the surroundings. The designers of the PFBR have made choices aimed at making the reactor cheaper rather than safer. The safety assessment of the PFBR points to some fundamental problems with how nuclear technology is regulated.

Being a targeted anti-poverty intervention, the SGSY prescribes quotas for women (40%) among the eligible poor and also mandates that 50% of self-help groups formed in an administrative block under the scheme be women's SHGS. This essay, through the prism of the SGSY scheme, attempts to understand how policy seeks to "mainstream" rural women from low-income households into market-oriented economic activities that seemingly facilitate a linear movement out of poverty. It examines how women themselves perceive the SGSY policy and the entrepreneurial identities it proposes they assume, and how selected women swarozgaris strive to engineer a fit between the imperatives of policy and their divergent life circumstances.

There is an inadequate understanding as to how the discourse on empowerment through microcredit is framed by different actors and what the trade-offs are between different dimensions of empowerment. Limited attention is paid to the role of various institutions — local and national — on microcredit and women's empowerment.

As conceived, the transformatory potential of NREGA is limited. When operationalised in letter and spirit, such programmes may alleviate poverty, and to that extent empower women, but cannot transform our rural economies that are characterised by low growth, poor investments in infrastructure and limited generation of growth-led decent employment.

Public Policy in Kerala||SEEMA BHASKARAN||While conventional indicators in Kerala that measure the status of women such as literacy, life expectancy, sex ratio, average age of marriage, infant mortality, and maternal mortality are mostly favourable, women have not fared well in the state in terms of non-conventional indicators such as gender-based violence, mental health, and the incidence of suicides. This paper attempts to take a critical look at the much-acclaimed status indicators for women in Kerala and reflects on the work of the Mahila Samakhya Programme as an illustration of public policy focused on women.

This study draws upon the findings of a research project of the National Domestic Workers Movement that was conducted between February 2010 and February 2011. It sets out the definition of domestic work as a conceptual issue that is necessary for understanding domestic work and explores the constitutional and employment law framework and the challenges in legislating for this sector. It concludes with exploring ways of reducing the gap between law and practice.

It thus leaves out the large majority of women in the unorganised sector. A new scheme such as the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana which is being piloted in 52 districts implicitly recognises the need to compensate for wage loss due to maternity and provide support for the mother and child's nutrition. However, a series of exclusionary clauses mar the objectives of the scheme. This paper attempts to demonstrate the misguided "targeting" of this scheme. The Planning Commission is preparing to scale it up at the national level in the Twelfth Plan, perhaps with the same set of incentives and disincentives as are currently spelt out in the pilot phase document. The data clearly shows that if these exclusionary clauses remain they will "victimise the victim".

An understanding of the out-of-pocket expenditures required for cancer care can improve the healthcare delivery process in India, both for the patients and families on the one side, and the health professionals and administrators on the other. This study estimates the expenditures borne by the surveyed patients for diagnosis and initial cancer-directed treatments as direct and indirect costs. Out of the one million newly diagnosed cancer patients per year in India, nearly 50% are suitable for curative cancer-directed therapy. It will be a highly justifiable approach to make financial provision for those cancer patients who cannot meet treatment costs and may be denied the benefits of cancer care.

Examining some of the explicit and not-so-explicit trends in women's work participation in India from 1993-94 to 2009-10, this paper argues that indications are that there is a crisis in women's employment under liberalisation-led growth. It shows how specific attention given to unpaid work in NSS data can overturn standard assumptions on women's employment and that this is vitally important to discussions on employment growth in India.

This paper makes a systematic effort to assess the performance of the family welfare programmes vis-à-vis the trends in expenditure. The trends in key performance indicators for India and selected states reveal that progress has been slow and limited in the post-RCH policy regime. Child immunisation coverage has decelerated, and the increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate and institutional delivery coverage have stalled. Consequently, the pace of reduction in the total fertility rate and infant mortality rate has slowed. Overall, the progress in key programme indicators is found to be incommensurate with rising expenditure.

It is explained away, however, on the grounds that since these patients get subsidised/free treatment, they should shoulder the responsibility of letting doctors learn on their bodies.

Given that the flow of agriculture credit has not necessarily been inclusive in the last decade, this analysis points out that while deciding on the targets for the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, it is important to address the regional and size imbalances. It is also important to recognise the need to synchronise the flow of credit with the agricultural seasons so as to optimise its impact on agricultural production.

India's relatively high consumption is due in part to a historically low or no tax on bidis and an inefficient, complex system of taxing cigarettes. In the context of planned tax reforms in India, we provide specific recommendations to raise tobacco taxes and to adopt a simpler and more efficient tax administration that would curb smoking. We estimate that raising the tax as a percentage of retail price from 7% to 33% for bidis and from 43% to 58% for cigarettes would conservatively lead to about 14 million smokers quitting and 27 million children never starting, thereby saving some 69 million years of healthy life over the next 40 years. The increase would also raise about Rs 73 billion or an additional 1.2% of current government revenue, while incurring no or minimal economic harm. Modest action on tobacco taxes in India might well save millions of lives.

It begins with the origins of discrimination in historical perspective, and explains how discrimination leads to exclusion, to show that embedded injustice is an outcome of the process. The conception of justice evolved over a long period of time that spanned centuries if not millennia. Yet, it is clear that the quest for social justice, driven by political democracy mostly through affirmative action, essentially surfaced during the second half of the 20th century. This leads into a discussion on the logic, the necessity and the limitations of affirmative action to highlight what else is needed. And a dose of reality is imparted to the story with a tale of three countries, even if the focus is on India. In conclusion, the paper draws some lessons from experience to contemplate the future.

It compares contract farming in gherkin and rice seed with non-contract farming. It shows the difference in the characteristics of contract and non-contract farm households. Delayed payment, lack of credit, scarcity of water, and difficulty in meeting quality requirements are found to be the major constraints faced by contract farmers. Whenever there is a decline in productivity, the concerned contracting company has a tendency to shift production to other farmers and also to other regions.

The news was overwhelmingly related to the concerns of the middle-class English-medium education readership. The RTE Act itself received very limited reporting.

Its principal defect is that it attaches an arbitrary mark-up to the historical market price to determine compensation amounts. This will guarantee neither social justice nor the efficient use of resources. The Bill also places unnecessary and severe conditions on land acquisition, such as restrictions on the use of multicropped land and insistence on public purpose, all of which are going to stifle the pace of development without promoting the interests of farmers. We present an alternative approach that will allow farmers to choose compensation in either land or cash, determine their own price instead of leaving it to the government's discretion, and also reallocate the remaining farmland in the most efficient manner. Our proposed method involves a land auction covering not only the project site but also the surrounding agricultural land.

With the British invasion the picture began to change gradually. Opening up of the Brahmaputra Valley in 1826 brought about two major changes in the mode of surplus extraction. One, colonial capital flowed into tea plantations, along with indentured labourers from mainland India. Though immensely profitable for the planters, this had a limited impact on the larger peasant economy of Assam. A more fundamental second change — spurred by the revenue of the colonial state, infusion of merchant capital and immigration of peasants from East Bengal — started a process of land alienation, commercialisation and indebtedness. In time, the agrarian economy of Assam started to resemble, and become firmly integrated with, the rest of the subcontinent. This essay examines a few aspects of this economic change.

The geographic distribution of this expansion is highly uneven, showing clustering in certain coal-mining states, and further within districts and regions. By backing independent power producers through comprehensive memoranda of understanding, state governments have forsaken the communities that will bear the environmental, health and livelihood impact of these thermal clusters.

Could this be the result of some kind of census activism working under pressure to report a higher pace of urbanisation? Since the Census of India has a reputation for rigour, it is imperative that the methodology for identification of new towns and possible changes from the past are made public.

It explains why and how democracy is believed to make a difference to a country's health and human development performance. Further the article highlights the significant variation in IMRS across states and the good to moderate performance among a number of states.

The decision culminated nearly a decade of an intense tussle within the World Bank between the central and regional offices and between the India division and those in charge of resettlement; between the World Bank and transnational and national non-governmental organisations; between the World Bank and the Government of India and the Government of Gujarat; between the board and the management of the institution; and across many other areas of conflict. For the World Bank the Narmada issue was a defining moment in its relations with NGOS. There were also two lasting outcomes — a greater disclosure of information and the establishment of the independent Inspection Panel. However, even as issues relating to rehabilitation and environment are now integral to World Bank appraisals, there remain doubts within the institution about the importance of such concerns.

The labour share in value added of India's organised manufacturing sector has been on a downward trend, from 0.6 in 1980 to 0.26 in 2007. The study also finds that real wages have increased minimally during the period analysed — well below labour productivity — while the real profit rate and unit capital costs have increased substantially. The analysis questions policy recommendations that advocate wage moderation, which result from simply looking at the evolution of the ULC, and that blame the loss of competitiveness on high or increasing wages.

Poor Indians with homes in rural areas are no longer simple peasants or rural wage labourers. They are also dependent on migrant wage labour, on working in the rural non-farm economy and on petty commodity production and trade in the capitalist economy. This calls for revisiting the relevance of categories such as "poor peasant", "middle peasant", "rich peasant" by exploring the significance of the links that almost every single rural household seems to have (for its reproduction) with the wider economy beyond the village confines.

The riots have to be located against the backdrop of the socio-economic changes that London has undergone during the last few decades. The metropolis has turned into a megalopolis — a globalised urban system that has expanded through the territorial appropriation of suburbs into the megastructure, based on flows of multinational goods and services, investments and information technology, and immigration of human resources.

Breivik developed his ideas at a time when fringe groups and thinkers were able to develop a feeling of Islamophobia in Norwegian society. Conservative political parties in Norway too argue that Islamist forces have entrenched themselves as enclaves in society. However, after the horror of 22 July, there have been concerns about Islamophobic sentiments in public media and forums. Perhaps in the end the wake-up call that Breivik sought may have the opposite effect of what he intended.

Differences in Living Standards between Social Groups||IRA N GANG, KUNAL SEN and MYEONG-SU YUN||Affirmative action has been at the heart of public policy towards the socially disadvantaged in India. Compensatory discrimination policies adopted for the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes since independence are now available to Other Backward Classes. This paper examines why the OBCS have lower living standards, as measured by per capita household consumption expenditures, relative to the mainstream population, and whether these reasons are similar to those observed for SCS and STS. It finds that while the causes of the gap in living standards for the OBCS are broadly similar to those for the SCS and STS, the role of educational attainment in explaining the gap is particularly important for the OBCS.

It finds that once one looks at actual dependency — the ratio of nonworkers to workers — not only is this still very high, it has probably worsened in recent times. Moreover, it might worsen further if we achieve the highly desirable goal of eliminating child labour and the ultimately justifiable goal of reducing old-age labour, unless there is a major rise in working age labour force participation and/or productivity.

In contrast to orthodox Marxism which has hitherto understood Marxism as state socialist and ideological, this essay understands revolutionary Marxism as anti-state and ideology as the discourse of what Marx called the "spectral person" and consequently nothing but a theory of spectres. It contrasts the old problematic of state socialism and ideology with another problematic that it calls "desireology", a new discipline that firstly emphasises the importance of understanding Hegel — the philosopher par excellence of the European Enlightenment and the French Revolution — and then transforms this understanding in the theories of the Leninist party and the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.

It shows that gender-just outcomes would require much more than a minimal transfer of resources to women or opposition to offences against women.

People in the largest cities have achieved the greatest gains, followed by people in small towns and villages close to towns. Further away, in villages located more than five kilometres from the nearest town — home to more than half of the entire population of India — inflation-adjusted per capita incomes fell between 1993 and 2005. The steepest declines were experienced by the lowest income groups. Rising inequality is a natural result of these spatially distributed trends. The debilitating effects of "distance from town" need to be countered by connecting outlying villages with more and better physical and social infrastructures.

The ration card itself was moulded and refashioned through experiments with security and identification practices, debates around the norms of residence and family and encounters with corruption and illegality. This paper attempts to revisit the concept of welfare through a discussion of ration card forms and practices from 1940 to 1960, a period that covered the late years of colonial rule when this document was first introduced and the early post-independence years when its purpose, form and function were furiously debated. Ultimately, this paper questions the premise of the current unique identification number project that universal or wider enumeration naturally translates into improved and more equitable access to welfare.

The dominance of this social divide over the regional divide clearly calls for policies and programmes that are more socially sensitive and nuanced to take care of the varying regional contexts. The analysis in this paper reveals the economic gradation of poverty which is closely associated with social gradation in terms of social identity.

Focusing on rural hospitals in West Bengal, this article examines the structure of user fees and compares it across a set of basic diagnostic services delivered by public sector healthcare institutions, public-private partnerships and the private sector.

If it is competition, then it would be alright to subject the new banks to the same branch licensing norms as the existing ones; if it is inclusion then they must be told to focus to a greater extent on unbanked centres.

Missing in the frenzy was any effort to arrive at an understanding of what "corruption" meant to the people joining the protest. Also lacking was a sense of tolerance for alternative views on a complex social phenomenon. Far from reflecting the complex and multilayered anxieties that underpin the growing popular restiveness with governance processes, the media chose to present a singular authoritarian point of view as the true and authentic voice of all Indians. The implications for the quality of the public discourse on the future of democracy are grim.

The analysis suggests that the euphoria about high employment growth during 1999-2004 was not justified nor does the concern about jobless growth in the subsequent years capture the changes in employment structure. A long-term analysis of employment trends reveals that changes in the employment pattern and workforce structure have been sluggish and do not conform to the standard employment-output relationship. The analysis also flags certain issues which have a bearing on the comparability of employment data before and after 1993-94. Large fluctuations seen after 1993-94 appear to be a result of the movement in and out of labour force of a substantial section of the population which is vulnerable and in the informal sector in a phase of rising overall rates of economic growth. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the results of the recently released 2009-10 survey.

In light of the recent debates surrounding the formulation of ecotourism guidelines for tiger reserves, this article undertakes a critical analysis of some of the ecotourism policies and programmes of the Indian government so far. It evaluates the ecotourism discourse specifically within the paradigm of sustainable development, which forms its legitimising base. The fragmented nature of ecotourism policies and practices and the resultant trade-offs unearthed, are then traced back to the contradictions and vagueness inherent in the very conceptualisation of ecotourism as a tool of sustainable development. This shows that revisions in guidelines, without a critical evaluation of the underlying conceptual basis, will not sufficiently address all the lacunae entailed.

The forces of corruption which are deeply embedded in our society will not give up easily, and are powerful enough to frustrate and resist the provisions of any Lokpal Bill. At the end, the fight against corruption has to be situated in the wider strategy of changing both the economic model of development and the social culture, which carry the seeds of corruption.

While there are errors in exclusion and inclusion of households covered, there has been a vast improvement in operation of the PDS; below the poverty line households seem to be receiving their entitlements. The households also express a strong preference for distribution of grain over cash.
Vol. 46, No. 36 (SEPTEMBER 3-9, 2011)||commentary||Human Dignity and Suffering: Some Considerations||LATA MANI||Does suffering affect dignity? This essay examines the consequences of construing dignity not as an intrinsic, constitutive quality integral to our very being but as an extrinsic, variable property dependent on certain conditions. It investigates the centrality of suffering to a left-of-centre imagining of solidarity politics and proposes that this Judeo-Christian legacy also contributes to an asymmetrical relationship between an activist-witness and suffering humanity.

It thereafter looks at some major features of Indian foreign policy, discusses how soft power might or might not relate to them, and zeroes in on how Indians, including the Indian government, may distinguish between "public diplomacy" and soft power in their conceptions of Indian foreign policy.
Vol. 46, No. 36 (SEPTEMBER 3-9, 2011)||special articles||Flying Blind: Waiting for a Real Reckoning on 1971||NAEEM MOHAIEMEN||Forty years after 1971, the Bangladesh liberation war remains a frozen object, not yet fully open to heterodox narratives. Historians need to unpack the complex and contradictory matrix that gave rise to Bengali nationalism, and the mixture of racism and hysteria that spurred the Pakistan Army on to a path of atrocities. This is essential for Bangladesh to decipher its post-liberation trajectory, and for Pakistan to excavate the roots of its current crises. Among several new books on the war is Sarmila Bose's Dead Reckoning, carrying a bizarre and shrill agenda of absolving Pakistan of allegations of a genocide. What we are left waiting for is a deep investigation into 1971—about the nature of violence, crisis bargaining, unintended consequences, and history's orphans. People's actions during war are always a combination of contradiction, heroism and failure of nerve; they are a fundamental aspect of being human. Bangladesh is still waiting for that human history of 1971.

Such global production networks allow the concentration of rents in lead firms, with some share of these rents possibly being shared with labour. However, profits and wages in competitive production segments, largely located in developing countries, will tend towards market-based minima. Various combinations of product and labour market conditions and their outcomes are analysed in this paper. It ends with a discussion of the different routes by which wages might be increased in such a system of global production networks.
Vol. 46, No. 36 (SEPTEMBER 3-9, 2011)||special articles||Wheat Price Inflation in Recent Times: Causes, Lessons and New Perspectives||STHANU R NAIR and LEENA MARY EAPEN||In this paper we demonstrate that the high level of wheat procurement during 2008-09 and 2009-10 at a higher minimum support price was necessitated by the difficult circumstances that the government faced, characterised by a precarious buffer stock position from 2005 to 2008. Hence, blaming larger procurement and a higher MSP alone for the soaring wheat prices between 2008 and 2010 is an oversimplification of the problem. The experience with wheat procurement in the recent past suggests that foodgrain procurement at a lower MSP may not always be feasible. Finally, it is shown that the inability of the government to utilise the abundant wheat stocks for the benefit of the consumers during the recent phase of high foodgrain prices was due to the poor offtake of the grain allotted to the states, not to the operations of private trade via the government's open market sales window.

The Hazare group has to realise that it has no monopoly on diagnosis or the cure for corruption. The Lokpal is no magic bullet which will solve the problem of corruption. Corruption needs a more cautious and nuanced problematic and a wider set of solutions. To put it facetiously, Hazare's group should not look like an A grade version of the Munna Bhai effect. Life is like a duller form of documentary. One needs to summon history for a more fruitful understanding of this situation.

The solution to this problem lies in the reform of the public service design and delivery at all levels of government. Transparency in public governance can go a long way in reducing the scope for corruption. That discretionary decision-making under the shadow of non-transparency is tailor-made to breed corruption is borne out by numerous recent cases.

Vol. 46, No. 35 (AUGUST 27-SEPTEMBER 2, 2011)||survey of experimental economics||Experimental Economics: A Survey||SUJOY CHAKRAVARTY, DANIEL FRIEDMAN, GAUTAM GUPTA, NEERAJ HATEKAR, SANTANU MITRA and SHYAM SUNDER||Over the past few decades, experimental methods have given economists access to new sources of data and enlarged the set of economic propositions that can be validated. This field has grown exponentially in the past few decades, but is still relatively new to the average Indian academic. The objective of this survey is to familiarise the Indian audience with some aspects of experimental economics. The survey attempts to bring to the interested reader a flavour of this field. The survey is presented in five separate articles after this introduction. The notes and references for all articles are at the end of the survey.
Vol. 46, No. 35 (AUGUST 27-SEPTEMBER 2, 2011)||survey of experimental economics||1 Emergence of Experimental Economics||||The survey begins, in Part 1, with a presentation of the historical emergence of the subject and provides the methodological justification for economics experiments. In presenting the history of the field, Part I also discusses the forces that impelled or impeded its evolution.
Vol. 46, No. 35 (AUGUST 27-SEPTEMBER 2, 2011)||survey of experimental economics||2 Experiments on Individual Decision-Making||||Part 2 of the survey looks at experimental results dealing with individual choice. The discussion compares the two dominant experimental methodologies that govern individual decision-making experiments in social science. It then discusses decision-making experiments under two main heads — the psychology-oriented experiments (or what has now morphed into behavioural economics) and experiments that test observed behaviour against theoretical benchmarks derived from neoclassical microeconomic theory. The last section provides an overview and looks ahead to the future of experiments in decision-making.
Vol. 46, No. 35 (AUGUST 27-SEPTEMBER 2, 2011)||survey of experimental economics||3 Experiments in Macroeconomics and Finance||||Part 3 reviews experiments in finance and economics, with an emphasis on evaluating the learning from such experiments.
Vol. 46, No. 35 (AUGUST 27-SEPTEMBER 2, 2011)||survey of experimental economics||4 Public Goods Experiments and Social Preferences||||Part 4 of the survey offers an overview of public goods experiments, an area where experimentation has been particularly fruitful.

The concluding part of this survey offers a brief overview of experiments conducted in the Indian context. These have been largely field experiments.
Vol. 46, No. 35 (AUGUST 27-SEPTEMBER 2, 2011)||perspectives||The Politics of Independence in Bangladesh||DAVID LUDDEN||Historians still do not have all the records they need to fully understand the freedom struggle of Bangladesh and offer a proper appreciation of the role of all the participants. Political parties remain justifiably attached to their founders; partisans attached to India and Pakistan also have their memories, points of view and all merit attention. To recover the deeper history of independence, however, scholars need to study its popular dimensions, and, in that light, it is most obvious that radical student leaders and countless lesser lights in the people's struggle for independence still do not have the place in history they deserve.
Vol. 46, No. 35 (AUGUST 27-SEPTEMBER 2, 2011)||special articles||Rebalancing the Chinese Economy||YU YONGDING||China has tried to correct the imbalances in its external sector in a number of ways, but all the efforts have failed to address the direct cause of the rapid increase in foreign exchange reserves. To stop the accumulation of reserves and thus minimise China's welfare and capital losses, the simplest solution would be for the People's Bank of China to end intervention in the foreign exchange market. Ending central bank intervention in currency markets is a complex issue. But the economic and welfare costs of China's slow pace in adjusting the exchange rate are very high and will only increase by the day. It is time for China to consider allowing the yuan to float freely, while reserving the right to intervene when it must, and tighten the management of cross-border capital flows which has become permissible under the Group of 20's agreements.
Vol. 46, No. 35 (AUGUST 27-SEPTEMBER 2, 2011)||special articles||Rural Coverage in the Hindi and English Dailies||VIPUL MUDGAL||This study of three each of India's highest circulated English and Hindi dailies finds that they devote only a minuscule proportion of their total coverage (about 2%) to rural India's issues, crises and anxieties. Even this low count could be misleading because most rural news is not about the farmers/villagers or about their concerns related to land, livestock, resources or farming. The content analysis of 968 news items shows that 36% of the coverage goes to issues of violence, accidents, crime or disasters. Less than 28% is about agrarian themes while 15% is about hunger, suicides, malnutrition, distress migration, displacement, or farmers' movements. The English newspapers had more coverage of rural distress than the Hindi ones. The authoritative sources quoted most often in the routine news tend to belong to the establishment.
Vol. 46, No. 35 (AUGUST 27-SEPTEMBER 2, 2011)||special articles||Expanding the School Market in India: Parental Choice and the Reproduction of Social Inequality||ELIZABETH HILL, MEERA SAMSON and SHYAMASREE DASGUPTA||Since the 1990s, private providers have made a significant contribution to increasing the size of the schooling marketplace. However, qualitative data collected as part of the probe Revisited survey in 2006-07 reveals that the expanded school market has become a new locus along which existing social inequalities are being reproduced and entrenched. An analysis of the dynamics of schooling choice in a village in Rajasthan attempts to answer the following questions. One, what determines schooling choice? Two, what is the relationship between the expanded school market and schooling quality within and between government and private schools? The paper thus provides a rich and detailed account of how an expanded school market changes the institutional culture within which parents make decisions about schooling and how education is affecting patterns of social disadvantage.

Concerns regarding public interest, trust and legitimacy emerge as expert advice appears increasingly biased and/or incompetent. And yet, at the same time, we also see an ever-increasing role of experts in democratic politics, their specialised judgment forming the basis of policy decisions.

This has reversed the declining trend in the growth rate of the urban population observed during the 1980s and 1990s. Also, for the first time since independence, the absolute increase in the urban population was higher than that in the rural population. This has huge implications for providing infrastructure and other civic amenities in urban areas.

It is socially, financially and politically the right way forward, but it needs to be articulated in much more explicit terms than what is currently proposed by the government.

The true problems of the US economy, to which the rating agencies have turned a blind eye, persist to this day. Now Standard & Poor's states that a very large government debt poses a systemic risk and calls for more stringent fiscal austerity. S&P has got the numbers and the rationale wrong. The systemic risk resides on a public debt that is too small for what is required to climb out of the Great Recession.

The rising importance of the Indian Ocean in the global economy has also increased Sri Lanka's centrality in international geopolitics. In this vortex, Sri Lanka is openly trying to mollify India and the US on the one hand and China on the other.

It indicates that "overheating", which has recently acquired policy focus, drives inflation in the short run, whereas international materials and energy prices drive inflation over the short as well as the long run. The study implies that restrictive monetary policy might be of only limited relevance in controlling non-food inflation. Public policy aimed at minimising the impact of input cost shocks might work better in the long run. In the meanwhile, the restrictive monetary policy followed by the Reserve Bank of India might worsen the downturn that has begun in January 2010.

The paper examines the case of Tungabhadra sub-basin in south India and finds that it has made little progress in practical terms with regard to intra- and inter-sectoral allocation of water. The concept of IWRM in Tungabhadra is relatively new and water management has been performed mainly at the state level. As a result, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have their own set of different water governance regimes — water policies, laws and legislations, institutions and practices — with relatively little interaction between them.

The broad contours of a deal and whose interests it would serve were known for some time. However, it could be a pyrrhic victory for the powerful financial sector. The downgrade of us debt by one rating agency does not change anything.

Vol. 46, No. 33 (AUGUST 13-19, 2011)||commentary||Beyond Corruption in Mining: A Derailed Democracy||A R VASAVI||The revelations of the Karnataka Lokayukta report are symptomatic of a larger story that goes beyond corruption in high places. There has been a neglect of state institutions and decisions by the executive are taken not under consultation with the assembly but as decreed by a new religious math-temple-resort complex that has come to wield power and influence. Democratic processes have been sidelined and people's movements have been corrupted. The uneven growth of the state economy that has accompanied these processes holds out the danger of Karnataka becoming a land of deep inhumanity.

This classification says more about the quality of the evidence available from studies, rather than about whether radio frequency electromagnetic fields increase the risk of cancer. In plain language, the WHO centre's answer to whether mobile phone usage poses a cancer risk is that it might but we do not know enough about it as yet.

While exploitation, sexual abuse, inadequate healthcare and issues of remuneration need to be addressed, it should also be recognised that children have always figured prominently in the history of physical training and culture in circuses. The present circumstances could bring down the edifice of the 140-year old Indian circus for good.

This article raises a counter question, what if the markets, as it happens in several instances, fail to deliver on account of the structural snags that may continue to persist in a rapidly growing and yet highly segmented economy?

The four articles in this special section, three of them by directors of ICSSR institutes, discuss different aspects of the report of the committee. The first article commends the quality of analysis and the recommendation to correct the current niggardly government financing of the ICSSR but asks why there has been no discussion of the quality of research and accountability in the social science institutes.

Colonial census officials, working with concepts of varna and jati, struggled unsuccessfully to define and classify these into castes on a single pan-India list, where each caste had to be discreet, homogeneous and enumerable. The history of caste enumeration in the Indian census illustrates how difficult it is to capture indigenous social hierarchies and identities under the term "caste". We embark on a new caste census without having addressed many of these challenges.

While public policy has shown some response to this phenomenon, there is scope for improvement of the coverage of the programmes. Health insurance schemes like the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana cover only conditional hospitalisation expenses. This paper argues that treatment cost incurred on ailments not requiring hospitalisation is also a substantial burden on the urban poor. Based on a case study of 150 slum households in south Delhi with a history of treated ailments within a specific recall period, the study estimates the degree and distribution of this burden across socio-economic and disease characteristics in the sample. The paper argues for a more holistic approach in social safety nets like the RSBY, and for explicitly including uncovered healthcare payments in measurement of the poverty lines for a more accurate estimation of the marginalised.
Vol. 46, No. 33 (AUGUST 13-19, 2011)||special articles||The Partido Indiano and the September Revolt of 1890 in Goa||SHARON DA CRUZ and MAX DE LOYOLA FURTADO||A small section of the Goan elite sought political and civil rights and founded the Partido Indiano (Indian Party) in 1865 in the village of Orlim. It enjoyed mass support particularly of the local Catholics. The rival party was the pro-establishment Partido Ultramarino. The violence that ensued in Margao in 1890 during the municipal elections is known as the 21 September Revolt. It lasted for a mere 20 minutes though the military firing killed 12 persons on the spot besides injuring many more. Protest meetings were held not just in Goa but also in Bombay, Poona, Karachi and Zanzibar. Even the Canadian and American press condemned the brutality and carried news on the "Goa Revolution". This article brings out the history of that revolt in the context of the working of colonialism in Goa.

In particular, it shows that weaker sections such as femaleheaded households have a much lower access than their male counterpart even when they are involved in similar economic activities and consequently face significantly higher rates of interest.

The poor farmers, fishermen, and petty traders in the neighbourhood refuse to give up their land and be rehabilitated. This article journeys briefly into some of the issues to help understand the complex contest over both conservation practices and ownership of a prized space.
Vol. 46, No. 32 (AUGUST 6-12, 2011)||commentary||Fundamental Flaws in the European Project||GEORGE IRVIN and ALEX IZURIETA||The euro aimed at removing nominal exchange rate fluctuations in a wide free-trade area and was informed by a neo-liberal view of leaving policy entirely to market forces. In consequence, by way of its specific design, it removed three essential policy instruments at once from the domain of national policymaking — exchange rate management, monetary policy and fiscal policy— and it intrinsically weakened labour and welfare policy. These are the fundamental flaws in the design of the European project.
Vol. 46, No. 32 (AUGUST 6-12, 2011)||commentary||Power of Supreme Court to Intervene in Executive Policy||SUKUMAR MUKHOPADHYAY||The central government has filed a review petition against the Supreme Court judgment in the black money case on the ground that the ruling interferes with the domain of the executive. In the past, the courts have on occasion abstained from ruling on economic or fiscal policies of the government. At other times they have abstained if they felt the policies were made in public interest. On yet other occasions they have passed judgments when they have felt that the concerned economic policies have impinged on fundamental rights. If the current review petition is admitted and goes before a seven- or nine-member bench, the ruling will be greatly anticipated.
Vol. 46, No. 32 (AUGUST 6-12, 2011)||commentary||Draft Communal Violence Bill 2011: Areas of Concern||SUHASINI SEN||The National Advisory Council's draft Prevention of Communal and Targeted Violence (Access to Justice and Reparations) Bill 2011 rests on the premise that while the existing legal framework adequately addresses communal violence directed at dominant groups, it fails when the group affected is a religious or linguistic minority. However, there exist several concerns in the draft related to accountability, command responsibility, and the watering down of accepted principles of criminal jurisprudence. Further, is an entirely new legislation replete with tough restrictions on civil liberties the best solution that we can think of?

The shift to education among the youth is a positive development but does not by itself explain the decline of the labour force participation rate.

But these exercises signify nothing if the people themselves are denied access to justice and consequently lose faith in the state's judicial institutions. A report based on two studies and a visit to the state.

The people responded in the ballots for elections to local bodies in the Northern Province with dignity. If there is a larger lesson to be learned from the elections, it is that there are limits to the political muscle of party machines and patronage.

This paper discusses findings from an experimental information and education campaign and household survey carried out in the first year of the programme in Delhi. First, the IEC had no impact on enrolment, but households who were part of the household survey sample and therefore received information closer to the enrolment period were 60% more likely to enrol. Second, there is little evidence that the insurance company selectively enrolled healthier households. Instead, hospital claims were lower for households who received the IEC and for households who received both the survey and the IEC, suggesting that the marginal household enrolled was in fact healthier. Implications for the programme and its evaluation are discussed in the light of these findings.

US aid to Pakistan may, in effect, have made things far worse for all supposed beneficiaries.

This contribution from the states looks at the perseverance of caste domination and hegemony which has derailed the process of justice even after the judicial proceedings were shifted out of Haryana. In parallels eerily similar to Gujarat, the author finds a collusion between state power and the powerful accused.
Vol. 46, No. 31 (JULY 30-AUGUST 5, 2011)||commentary||The Communal and Targeted Violence Bill||MIHIR DESAI||The Indian Penal Code and the various police acts give the executive and the police ample powers to deal with communal violence. Failure to implement these laws is one of the major problems confronting the prevention of communal violence. However, there are a number of connected issues which the present laws are powerless to deal with — like responsibility pertaining to the public servant in control of armed or security forces who fails to exercise control over his/her subordinates, witness protection, reparations, and a regular machinery to pay compensation. The National Advisory Council's draft anti-communal violence bill takes these shortcomings into account. However, it too suffers from certain lacunae which need to be addressed.

In this context, the debate on Bt brinjal needs to broaden its frame from science-based assessment of consequences to evaluate society-oriented causes and objectives. We need to ask questions such as: What kind of society do we wish to live in? What kind of science and technology do we want? Who sets the agenda for science and technology development and who controls the science and technological decisions?

The globalised economy, hegemonised by immaterial labour, creates conditions for these new towns to culturally secede from their national or regional location and align themselves with the global cities. However, the condition of post-coloniality, characterised by capital and its wasteland, manifests itself in the new towns as the slow but inevitable encroachment of the excluded population on these new zones of exclusivity.
Vol. 46, No. 31 (JULY 30-AUGUST 5, 2011)||review of urban affairs||Urban Development and Metro Governance||K C SIVARAMAKRISHNAN||While the outcomes of the Lok Sabha and the state assembly elections have been well documented and analysed, little is known about the electoral geography in urban areas. In discussing the conflicting interests of local politics and urban development, this article places the definition and understanding of what is "urban" in the context of the 74th constitutional amendment, and also looks at the expectations from and the progress on the reforms agenda of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. Further, the article addresses the high economic stakes and challenges involved in metro governance, while arguing that these cannot be dealt with under the general rubric of Union-State-Municipality. International experience is relevant in this regard not for the structural models followed, but because unlike in India, the subject of urban governance in most cities around the world has been a matter of serious debate and action.
Vol. 46, No. 31 (JULY 30-AUGUST 5, 2011)||review of urban affairs||Branded and Renewed? Policies, Politics and Processes of Urban Development in the Reform Era||DARSHINI MAHADEVIA||Hidden behind city branding exercises through large projects are acts of land capture and slum demolitions by a predatory local state and crony capitalism. In the policy arena, meanwhile, the urban, and particularly the metropolitan story has been one of deliberate confusion, and fragmentation of policy and implementation. The promise of rapid city transformation has not been met through the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission, which does something for infrastructure and something for housing but all in an uncoordinated project-by-project manner. Neither the infrastructure agenda nor shelter security for all is advanced. The urban reality instead has been one of gradual improvement, with or without these policy and branding initiatives.

But it holds that the vernacular version had to navigate the structures of language and a social structure in which caste was an important feature to make itself comprehensible to other intellectuals, trade union leaders and workers. It was in this process that its strategy of obscuring caste subjectivities and creating a new identity of class found its greatest success and also its ultimate failure.
Vol. 46, No. 31 (JULY 30-AUGUST 5, 2011)||review of urban affairs||The Board and the Bank: Changing Policies towards Slums in Chennai||NITHYA RAMAN||Arguing that the initial years of the Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board were dominated by the priorities of the then ruling party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, whose government created it in 1971, this paper points out that shelter policies in the state had a formal orientation away from eviction and resettlement and towards in situ tenement construction, alongside an informal tendency to protect and reward those groups of the urban poor that the party was trying to court for votes. This arrangement was affected by the World Bank's entry into the domain of urban-sector funding in 1975, which, despite stiff resistance from the implementing agencies, eventually managed to change the focus of local policies and to a great extent delink the TNSCB from political influence. The effects of this can be seen in the TNSCB'S current housing policies.

Vol. 46, No. 31 (JULY 30-AUGUST 5, 2011)||special articles||Rethinking Social Sciences and Humanities in the Contemporary World||GEORGE VARGHESE K||While Eurocentrism is a problem in Indian disciplines of knowledge today, a careful understanding of the methodological and conceptual issues involved in the diversification, interdisciplinarity and the advancement of the western systems of knowledge is required. Though there is a seeming illogic in the profusion of disciplines in the west today, it is marked by a heroic spirit for new experimentations, adventures and scientific advancement. True, its dynamic is often deleterious and fragmentary to the subject positions and cultural identity of the western humankind. Nonetheless, in the final tallying of the good and bad, the knowledge explosion only works to their overall advantage compared to the rest of the world.

Following a review of recent evidence on infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, mental health and suicides, and maternal mortality, this paper argues that there are challenges arising from declining investments in the public health sector (and increasing privatisation) and inadequate attention to the social determinants of health. It also lists suggestions for policy and a research agenda to further health equity.

Global institutional arrangements on migrant remittances are the least institutionalised area of the global economy since the developed countries want it so. The flexibilities allowed under the GATS Mode 4 are examined under three issues — low-skilled workers, removal of quotas for the highly-skilled migrants, and totalisation of taxes for all migrants.

After Independence, however, puppetry became a tool for development communication, reaching every nook and corner of rural and poor, urban Gujarat. With the 1990s, and the advent of globalisation, these innovations have found little encouragement and puppeteers have increasingly become workers of an entertainment heritage industry, leading to new forms of neo-brahminical and neo-mercantile exploitation.
Vol. 46, No. 30 (JULY 23-29, 2011)||commentary||Wounded Mumbai||KALPANA SHARMA||The 13 July bomb blasts in Mumbai have posed questions once again about the vulnerability of the city to terrorist attacks. But everyday life is itself terrifying for the majority in Mumbai. It is a terror to which you get inured; you do not even think of it as terror. One of the key issues in dealing with the vulnerability of Mumbai is of enhancing a sense of citizenship in all residents, and not just the privileged. It is the erosion of that sense of association with the city, exacerbated by divisive politics, that needs to be addressed — not to deal just with external terror attacks, but to tackle the terror of people's daily lives.

In both, the murderer sought to interfere with the fundamental constitutional rights of his victims. Yet, the Supreme Court advocated the death penalty in the honour killing case but only life imprisonment in the Staines case. There are strong moral reasons for abolishing the death penalty altogether. However, as long as it continues to exist on the statute books, it must be applied in a constitutionally consistent manner, an approach which must accord equal status to equal rights.

The resolution of these issues is likely to result in larger market access gains for India than Pakistan. To achieve mutual benefits, the two countries should, despite recent political events, also focus on removing barriers such as transport protocols that are specific to bilateral trade.

Not only has the programme revitalised the primary health care system, it has also helped overcome the gendered division of public and private space that is a major obstacle to women's access to basic services, including education, and employment opportunities. However, there are a number of shortcomings that need government intervention to ensure that it fulfils its aims.

These strands brought complementary skills to the table. The neo-Gandhians conferred legitimacy; India Shining provided energy and finances; and Legal Activists helped navigate the legislative path. The movement also attracted the opprobrium of the Independent Left. Understanding these intellectual strands helps explain the Anna Hazare movement. Equally, the movement sheds light on India's new middle classes and their forms of political engagement.
Vol. 46, No. 30 (JULY 23-29, 2011)||special articles||The Domination of Strangers: Time, Emotion and the Making of the Modern State in Colonial India||JON E WILSON||Historians and anthropologists have recently stressed the decentralised and fragmented nature of the power of the colonial and postcolonial state. Such perspectives, most recently articulated by Akhil Gupta, forget that state power often operates through precisely such a critique of the chaotic nature of government in the present, which it contrasts with the unified, coherent institution it attempts to create in the future. The language of fragmentation is a product of modern governance. This article traces the origins of modern state practices in India to the anxious efforts of colonial officials to govern a society they had little emotional connection with. The estranged relationship of colonial officials with Indian social practices allowed them to produce a "progressive" form of rule that lived in the future, and abandoned any attempt to meaningfully engage with India's present day.

Several "positive" aspects of the reforms have been given high publicity, but they need to be assessed analytically. This paper addresses issues of governance reform at the IMF in the context of the emerging macroeconomic configurations.
Vol. 46, No. 30 (JULY 23-29, 2011)||special articles||Quotas and Minority Rights: Recapturing the Constitutional Vision||RUDOLF C HEREDIA||The constitutional purpose of affirmative action and the preferential treatment for the deprived and the vulnerable that it implied was to address the anomalies and contradictions of our society, specifically focusing on caste, religion, and patriarchy. Caste quotas have become a quest for upward social mobility; the creamy layer of recipient communities uses them for its own partisan benefit to the exclusion of those more disadvantaged and more deserving in their own communities. Minority rights consolidate the traditional elites and religious leaders of these communities who become fundamentalist to preserve the status quo. Recapturing the constitutional vision of an inclusive and egalitarian society and a participative and integrated democracy will demand another model of development, with more fine-tuned affirmative policies and a more focused preferential treatment for the disadvantaged.

Vol. 46, No. 29 (JULY 16-22, 2011)||commentary||The Left in Decline||PRABHAT PATNAIK||Empiricisation or the pursuit of a political praxis that is uninformed by the project of transcending capitalism was ultimately responsible for the defeat of the CPI(M) in West Bengal. It is this empiricisation that is far more worrying than the election defeat itself. In a period when many have abandoned the concept of imperialism, the CPI(M) remains steadfast in its adherence to this concept; as long as the concept and the project remain valid, the historical relevance of the party remains unimpaired. But if the party does not arrest the process of empiricisation it has been experiencing and finally ends up accepting the hegemony of bourgeois theory, then it will get supplanted by some other communist formation subscribing to a theoretical position similar to what it has today.

But it would be a shame now when the opportunity presents itself for the university not to engage in sustained introspection and analysis, and initiate widespread consultation, as a prelude to implementing changes that are both bold and pragmatic. DU has, instead, embarked on a mission driven by an abject desire for global homogeneity, combined with a disastrous conservatism and lack of vision. A major overhaul of the system is being carried through with haste, students and teachers are being subjected to a costly and painful trial-and-error experiment, and draconian measures for implementation are being resorted to.

This caused severe distress to farmers, a majority of whom sold their produce at less than the minimum support price. A record procurement of the rabi crop by state agencies could not mitigate the crisis, which has become an annual phenomenon. The lopsided policy of the Food Corporation of India in Andhra Pradesh of procuring rice instead of paddy is the root cause of the problem.

For the past five years, the battleground of Thailand's political conflict has been the streets. In this melee, the composition and weight of each side has been hard to gauge. The poll result gives a clear reading; the election also shifts the conflict back into the formal institutions of representative democracy.

Parliament, the SC and the party system have all begun to reveal hitherto concealed deficiencies which should be brought to light and criticised, but constructively and not destructively.

In an integrated global economy, it is essential that the major economies coordinate their policies. But coordination does not imply simultaneous stimulus withdrawal from all G20 countries. Indeed, a phased withdrawal is probably the best guarantee against the risk of a negative global shock leading to another recession in the event of a simultaneous stimulus withdrawal from all G20 countries. Hence, this paper argues that each country needs to set the timing, scale and composition of its stimulus withdrawal keeping in mind its own macroeconomic outlook.

The availability for the first time of comparable all-India nutritional data for men and women enables us to examine the empirical basis of this belief. The analysis suggests that a huge gender gap in iron deficiency anaemia coexists with an absence of a gender gap in chronic energy deficiency. While gender gap in anaemia is a combined outcome of biological and social factors, the absence of gender gap in CED goes along with a stark socio-economic inequity in India.

This paper argues that there is a "hidden failure" even in those cases where community management is claimed to be "successful" within Ostrom's framework.

Particularly contentious is access to "appropriate land", which the non-agricultural sector requires for its expansion, and which is scarce because the State is not creating conditions conducive for farmers to sell their land. This article discusses the different phases in land acquisition since Independence, issues of adequate compensation, and the space this has created for different kinds of activism by members of civil society.

There is also an ongoing debate about whether and how the 2007-08 price spike might have been driven by financial speculation in commodity markets, and the role it is playing in the current episode of excessive price volatility. This note critically examines the debate.

MW-scale plants may be useful to kick-start the solar photovoltaic industry in India. However, promoting such plants while photovoltaic costs are relatively higher than other renewable energy sources may not be financially and strategically prudent. India's focus needs to be on the development of decentralised solar-installed capacity in rural areas where it will have the most social impact.

For nearly two centuries these poems have circulated whenever there has been a major crisis in, what may be called, the psychic world of south Asian Muslims. The first recorded appearance was in 1850, after the "Jihad" movement of Syed Ahmad had failed in the north-west, followed by serial appearances after the debacle of 1857, the dissolution of the Ottoman Caliphate and the failure of the Khilafat and Hijrat movements in 1924, the Partition of the country and community in 1947, and the Indo-Pak war of 1971-72. Curiously, these poems have re-emerged in Pakistan in 2010, and have found wider circulation on the internet. This paper traces the evolution of these poems since 1850, contextualises their appearances and offers some explanation for their hold on the minds of the Urdu-knowing Muslims of south Asia.

This coincided with a change of government and heightened public concerns about the adverse impact on poverty of the economic crisis. Federal as well as provincial governments demonstrated an unprecedented level of commitment to cash transfers and other programmes aimed specifically at the poor and vulnerable. The federal government's Benazir Income Support Programme was protected by law, and became the first targeted cash transfer programme to reach up to 7% of all households. It is too soon to say that social protection in Pakistan has finally turned a corner since the future course of public policy is vulnerable to political turbulence. This paper argues for measures that will signal that there has indeed been an irreversible paradigm shift.

Today they are thought to have rather important roles. On the other hand, foreign aid was earlier thought to have an important role while "aid pessimism" dominates development thinking today. This paper examines afresh the extent to which foreign trade, foreign private capital and foreign aid are helpful or unhelpful for development in labour-surplus dual economies. It concludes that managed trade is generally helpful while foreign private capital and foreign aid can be helpful only under certain rather special conditions.

The case of workers in the Shenzhen special economic zone in south China is representative of this trend. When agriculture was deprioritised there was an exodus to the cities. The "peasant workers" in Shenzhen are forced to pay taxes and fees in their native villages but are not officially accepted as urban workers and cannot enjoy the urban-based facilities that the latter do. They work in abysmal conditions for long hours and are not paid regularly. Moreover, any protest leads to instant job loss.

The military is now haemorrhaging from these unrelenting attacks. As violence grows, pessimism and despondency have permeated the intelligentsia, prompting a flight out of the country. Pakistan must realise that it is in deep peril because of its past policies. It needs to overcome its unrelenting hatred of India, leave Kashmir as a problem to be solved by the Kashmiris, concentrate upon improving governance and deal politically with the Baluchistan situation. India, through its confrontational policies with Pakistan, shares some responsibility for the present tragic state of affairs. It is therefore incumbent upon India to help Pakistan overcome its difficulties or, at any rate, to refrain from adding to them; this is in India's self-interest.

It gives the government complete power to acquire land for any "public purpose" while the courts have virtually adopted a handsoff attitude and allowed all kinds of land acquisitions for private companies. The proposed Land Acquisition Amendment Bill makes it much easier for the government to acquire land for any private company, is nonparticipatory in nature and has escape clauses as far as giving jobs to the displaced or the provision of "land for land" is concerned. The rehabilitation and resettlement bills which are also on the anvil may provide solace to the displaced but history has shown that such schemes do not work.

In India, for instance, faced with growing misery in the midst of accelerating growth, the standard response has been that such "exclusion" will disappear if the growth rate can be further accelerated. The proposition that an acceleration of the growth rate in the capitalist segment will be accompanied by an increase in unemployment in the economy as a whole, which is the basic element underlying poverty (as Marx had recognised), cuts at the foundation of all such claims.

The place of aborigines in the political space of the settlement was further unresolved. The newcomers in the Andamans spent six years on a literal and conceptual beach: the limited space between the ship and the jungle. Not knowing how to integrate the Andamanese into the ideology of their intrusion, and unable to sustain the vision of a permanent civilisation in the islands, they fell into a state of panic and dispersed. This paper argues that the failed settlement represented a conceptual and logistical limit of the late 18th century imaginary of the offshore colony.

The Mumbai Metropolitan Region is one of the most important growth engines for India as it accrues tremendous revenues to the central and the Maharashtra state governments. The paper assesses the performance of the governance system in MMR which resembles a polycentric governance system — a system that has been heralded as being greatly suited to metropolitan regions by several scholars. It recognises that metropolitan governance is but a concept, since in reality it comprises a loose bundle of multiple actors and organisations. For sharper focus, the paper studies the interactions between the only two (dominant) public organisations in governance — Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority. The assessment reveals that the institutions — rules of the game — which are essential for the efficient functioning of polycentric governance system are missing in the region. It emphasises the need to bring about micro reforms in the institutional framework for polycentric governance to be successful in MMR.

(b) How has the Indian services sector performed in the context of the General Agreement on Trade in Services and how is this reflected in rural India? (c) To what extent has the rural workforce gained from the IT revolution?

It was subsequently argued that the higher productivity of smallholdings would disappear with the adoption of superior technology, modernisation and growth in general. However, close to half a century later, National Sample Survey data from the initial years of the 21st century show that smallholdings in Indian agriculture still exhibit a higher productivity than large holdings. These smallholdings however show lower per capita productivity and the incidence of poverty is widespread. Strategies for Indian agriculture and smallholding households should include reducing the inequality in land distribution and promoting off-farm work in the rural areas itself. The strategy of improving the crop land-man ratio by facilitating migration from rural India has not worked and will not work. The lives of smallholding families can be improved only by building on their higher per acre agricultural productivity and by promoting off-farm rural employment.

However, the overall impression is that they are capital-intensive and suited to large farms. In this context, a study was undertaken in nine states, mainly to examine the actual area covered compared to the potential area and to understand the adoption level of MI as well as to analyse the cost and returns under different farm categories. The results indicated that only about 9% of the MI potential is covered in the country. Key suggestions include reduction in capital cost of the system, provision of technical support for operation after installation, relaxation of farm size limitation in providing subsidies and the establishment of a single state level agency for implementation of the programme.

There are a number of scholars and activists who tend to valorise premodern wisdoms without critically evaluating their sociocultural context and realising how deeply they were embedded in the social hierarchy of their times. There has been, of course, a great deal of stress lately on a kind of"eco-golden age". This is clearly a case of an "anachronistic projection of modern phenomenon on to the screen of tradition". Seen from such a perspective, all pre-industrial societies would exhibit a kind of harmony with nature. However, most of the times, it was the demographic and technological factors that made these societies less harmful to the environment. It was not that they wished to protect the whole canopy of nature. This reappraisal demonstrates how precepts and rites, culture and customary practices and state policy interact to lay the bases of water harvesting traditions. Social customs are the necessary conditions for sustaining these traditions, while local autonomy in resource management is the critical sufficient condition but it never results in equitable access for all.

Meanwhile, despite the high cost of irrigation - both in capital and operating costs-over the same period the area irrigated by tube wells has grown up. The latter is entirely dependent on the recharge of groundwater and the availability and cost of power. Whatever the future irrigation policy and its implementation, it will need a close ground level, local district and regional governmental efforts in Telangana.

Peasant movements were successful in raising the support prices for the apple crop in the early 1990s. Small landholdings and low productivity, coupled with the withdrawal of state support have raised the cost of production substantially, and denied remunerative prices to the poor and marginal growers. The entry of big private players, the deteriorating transport system, changes in the climate and absence of adequate insurance are all contributing to a major crisis in the apple economy.

The hounding out of a 90-year-old painter who was constantly striving to make us look at ourselves from a multi-cultural, secular, syncretic perspective, and our failure to ensure his return before he passed away five years later, should worry us about where we are heading as a nation. The fact that India could not see itself through the eyes of Husain and, instead, interpreted his epiphanic invocation and celebration of our civilisational diversity as something narrow and divisive, points to the rapid thickening and blocking of our national arteries, constricting the openness we so hypocritically assume as our cultural credo and hastening the spread of iron in the soul.

However, this conventional understanding may not be accurate. What these events suggest is that there is a growing crisis and contradiction within and between the institutions of the state in Pakistan and these crises and contradictions, evaluated differently, might offer a completely divergent narrative. What may be collapsing is the political settlement that has existed for many decades and this may be a positive development.

This has been done by deploying a variety of para-tariffs over and above customs duties, the significance of which appears to have escaped the notice of most of Sri Lanka's trading partners, including India. Unless rapidly unwound, these new policies will seriously damage the country's future economic growth. They also subvert Sri Lanka's preferential trade agreements, and breach its World Trade Organisation commitments.

A weakened and fragmented state and generalised poverty provide the grounds for low-cost piracy operations. The international response to piracy should not be based on considerations of security alone, but must prioritise state-building and developmental interventions because piracy is also a response to the glaring unevenness of the emergent global order.

When Maruti started operation in 1983, it was a turning point in the passenger car market. Prior to this, there was a tendency for the assemblers of automobiles to produce parts and components in-house. The "tierisation" of subcontracting evolved from the operations of Maruti. Value chain governance in the industry shifted from integrated firms to captive units. With economic reforms, the subcontractors of Maruti began supplying their products to other assemblers too. The transformation was from captive value chains to relational value chains. Small and medium enterprises manufacturing auto-components that started business in the 1980s and the 1990s have grown. In the process, small enterprises have expanded to become medium and large enterprises. But in spite of a rapid growth of production, new entrants to the auto-component industry declined in the 2000s. The necessity of high technology led to a significant hike in the initial investment required and raised barriers to entry. But the existing SMES actively set up new units.

Recent conservation interventions by the State with the creation of national parks governed by rules and regulations entailed a loss of use and access rights to forest areas and produce for the local people. This also led to a change in the perceptions of the local people in the context of conservation of forests and wildlife as it created socio-economic and cultural vulnerabilities. This paper examines the causal factors which influence the changing perceptions of the local people towards state-created national park areas. The main aim of the study is to identify the significance of non-wood forest products for forest dependent people living in rural ecosystem spaces. The case study here is of Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh.

Predictably, reactions from both the government as well as the LTTE'S supporters have been of denial or a selective acceptance of the report.

The relationship can be situated within the wider framework of an unstable structure (the Bengali bhadralok society in this case) and a multifaceted agency (the individual Rabindranath who inhabited that society), and the complementary role of the two in responding to and affecting on each other. Over a span of almost a century, Rabindranath played a twin role - one, as a creative artist, and the other, what we today define as a "public intellectual". During this period, he was pulled apart by bhadralok denigrators and hagiographers, and the reactions ranged from scorn to deification. This history of the contradictory reconstruction of Rabindranath's image by the Bengali bhadralok society reflects the social conflicts, intellectual debates and political pulls and pressures that had churned up and transformed that society during the last century — traversing great historical events like the anti-colonial national movement in India and the two world wars.

Using data on human casualties and damages suffered by the houses as dependent variables, and different meteorological, geophysical and socio-economic factors as independent variables, this study estimates a cyclone damage function to bring out the mitigating effects of the mangrove vegetation. The results show that mangroves did significantly reduce the occurrence of human deaths and the extent of damage to residential houses. Areas with mangrove protection are seen as having fewer fully collapsed houses and more partially collapsed houses. They are also found to have been more effective in reducing deaths than in reducing the damages to static properties.

There is strong evidence of correlation among the markets for different financial assets, including stocks/shares, commodities and currencies.

Long before Yeltsin hauled the red flag down, this class-in-formation had already occupied positions of control over major productive assets; however, legally sanctioned property relations constrained it, and thus it could not systematically appropriate the surplus product. Convinced that Soviet relations of ownership stood in the way of economic development, leaders of the nomenklatura and their allies overwhelmed the demoralised and disorganised remnants of workers' power.

The need to provision welfare within an accumulation regime premised on global competition, fiscal austerity and marketisation, and a simultaneous need to reduce labour costs and to ensure social security, to exclude and include labour appears paradoxical. Does this emphasis on social welfare by the local state imply resistance to or accommodation of the current growth paradigm? How does such welfare provisioning influence livelihood strategies of labour embedded in global production networks and subject to flexibilisation? What are the new spaces of mobilisations that the regulatory imperatives open up? This paper addresses these questions through a microlevel study of worker livelihoods and state regulation in Tiruppur in Tamil Nadu that has been integrated into global networks of commodity production through garment exports.

This study provides some benchmark figures on the effects of either making the national minimum wage floor compulsory or extending the coverage of state-level minimum wages. Using the 2004-05 Employment-Unemployment Survey along with the Consumer Expenditure Survey, it estimates that the extension of minimum wages at existing levels could improve the earnings of 73 to 76 million low-paid salaried and casual workers. It also shows that if an extended minimum wage is perfectly enforced, it would substantially reduce inequality, poverty and the gender pay gap, even if there are some disemployment effects.

Based on a primary survey, it was found that in the initial phase of the crisis, workers trimmed their spending on their social life. This was followed by a reduction in expenditure on health and education. As the crisis persisted, they were left with little alternative but to cut down expenditure even on essentials like food, shelter, clothing, etc. Further, distress caused by unemployment and a drastic reduction of incomes exacerbated domestic conflict, violence and depression, the brunt of which was experienced by women and children. The study finds that the impact of the crisis varied between gem polishing and construction industries and it was more severe for workers in the lowest income group in both industries.

Relative to the one currently in use, the application of the proposed methodology appears to be more beneficial in general to social groups such as scheduled tribes, most backward classes and mahadalits, as well as those landowning households that might suffer from specific debilitating conditions. However, in some cases it is less sensitive to Muslims, non-mahadalit scheduled castes and agricultural labourers. These observations are based on the results of a census survey covering 4,500 households in 18 rural wards of Bihar and West Bengal. By comparing the subset of households classified as poor according to the 2002 and the 2009 methodologies, the paper analyses "moving in" and "moving out" of poverty lists according to occupational categories, caste groups and landowning profile of the poor.

Ideally, estimates of calorie consumption and the assessment of food security would be similar under a wide variety of assumptions, and the range of estimates would be quite small. However, this paper, which estimates the calories consumed per Indian household using the 61st round of the National Sample Survey, finds that the assessment of food security varies significantly under slightly different assumptions. Given the significant amount of measurement error in estimates of calories consumed, it is important to analyse not only household consumption surveys, but also aggregate food availability studies and health surveys collecting anthropometric measures that accompany undernourishment, such as stunting.

This will accelerate irrigation benefits more than simply funding more dams and canals as the AIBP has done all along.

Vol. 46, No. 21 (MAY 21-27, 2011)||perspectives on cash transfers||A Case for Reframing the Cash Transfer Debate in India||SUDHA NARAYANAN||Cash transfers are now suggested by many as a silver bullet for addressing the problems that plague India's anti-poverty programmes. This article argues instead for evidence-based policy and informed public debate to clarify the place, prospects and problems of cash transfers in India. By drawing on key empirical findings from academic and grey literature across the world an attempt is made to draw attention to three aspects of cash transfers — design, implementation and impact. The article examines which instruments function the best and for what goals, what the broader context is in which these interventions are embedded, and what the difficulties associated with their implementation are.

In 2011 it will cover 5.8 million families. But Oportunidades warrants a critical analysis for its "conditions" deny any autonomy to the poor and the scheme is based on a system of rewards and punishment which assumes that the poor do not know what they want. Its record in reducing income poverty has also been limited. More can be learnt from recent modifications that cover the hitherto excluded, the very young children and the senior citizens. However, it is new proposals of a basic income transfer — universal, to individuals and without conditions — that hold out more promise.

The article outlines the circumstances that led to its adoption by the federal government and how its final design was influenced by all "competing views", rather than by the thinking of a specific interest group. Bolsa Família has demonstrated a flexibility to adapt to the needs of the times, a quality that should stand it in good stead in the years to come.

Variations in the rationale for a conditional cash transfer shape benefit amounts, coverage, duration of programme participation, targeting practices and the definition of conditionality. Drawing on the experience of low- and middle-income countries in Latin America, this article highlights differences in the design of CCTS and the central issues and trade-offs associated with income transfers, targeting and conditionality. It also reviews the evidence on the impact of CCTS on income poverty, service utilisation and outcomes in education and health.

Where cash transfers have helped to reduce poverty, they have added to public provision, not replaced it. For crucial items like food, direct provision protects poor consumers from rising prices and is part of a broader strategy to ensure domestic supply. Problems like targeting errors and diversion from deserving recipients are likely to be even more pronounced with cash transfers and cannot be eliminated through technological fixes like the UID.

This article argues that cash transfers offer many advantages over in-kind food transfers, and that their design can address potential pitfalls pointed out by critics. The more salient of such objections are discussed, and models for implementing cash transfers based on existing technology and infrastructure are proposed. However, in conclusion, it is recommended that instead of centralised dismantling of the public distribution system, the decision on the means of delivery should be left to the states.

However, the track record of previous legislation does not inspire confidence that the proposed reforms will be sufficient to ensure secure access to food for those who need it.

A close examination of the objectives of the subsidies in fertiliser and kerosene and the implications of the shift raises some challenging questions. While there is no doubt that India will have to move to a greater use of cash transfers, it may not necessarily be the best option in all cases. Unless discussions on transfers are part and parcel of a broader strategy, any changes in favour of cash transfers will simply amount to tactical differences and not address longterm challenges.

The Indian economy will enter the Twelfth Plan period in an environment of great promise, but the next five years will also be a period of major challenges. The economy has done well on the growth front during the Eleventh Plan, but, going by the information that is at least currently available, not so well on inclusion. Much of what needs to be done to accelerate gdp growth during the Twelfth Plan will be done by the private sector, but the central and state governments have a crucial role to play in providing a policy environment that is seen as investor-friendly and is supportive of inclusive growth. Four critical challenges facing the economy in the Twelfth Plan, which are perhaps more serious than they were at the start of the Eleventh Plan, are those of (a) managing the energy situation, (b) managing the water economy, (c) addressing the problems posed by the urban transformation that is likely to occur, and (d) ensuring protection of the environment in a manner that can facilitate rapid growth. In addition, the efficiency in implementation of projects on the ground needs to be greatly improved.

At the all-India level, diversion of PDS grain remains a serious issue; however there are interesting contrasts at the state level. Based on trends in monthly per capita purchase of PDS grain and estimated diversion, states are categorised into three groups "functioning", "reviving" and "languishing" states. The paper also discusses the possible reasons for the improvement in the PDS in the reviving states and questions the assessment of the PDS as uniformly and irreversibly dysfunctional.

This study of the community throws light on various aspects of Madariya Sufis, viz, their origins, growth and diversification of the order, their contrasting lifestyles, and their religious congregations. It traces the vicissitudes of the evolution of the Madariya order as well as its transition from an embattled group of warriors to a peaceful syncretic sect embedded in the rural population of 19th and 20th century India.

It was a revenue neutral budget, claiming to spend adequately on developmental schemes and yet getting back on the fiscal consolidation road map, The verdict, however, is that Budget 2011 seems to be just one more on the beaten track of backtracking on developmental expenditures when in fiscal correction mode.

Smaller schemes are difficult to administer at the national level and suffer from low uptake by the states. This positive development should therefore continue in the Twelfth Plan.

Local leaders, arguing for or against separate states, are often seen as acting without intent and merely playing politics. This article argues that this is so because of a federal division of responsibility which facilitates state-level politicians to discount responsibility for their stance and encourages them to focus solely on short-term goals. The central government intervention in the debate about Telangana has meant that regional politicians have become less able to discount the future and have instead begun to engage with somewhat greater intent.

Key programmes implemented in 20 villages during 2009 were studied using rapid scientific assessment methods. An indicator approach was adopted to analyse environmental services such as water for irrigation and improvement in soil quality. The status of environmental services before and after implementation of the activities was examined and vulnerability indices were constructed and compared. The activities were found to have reduced the vulnerability of agricultural production, water resources and livelihoods to uncertain rainfall, water scarcity and poor soil fertility.

The decade following independence from the British in 1948 was marred by insurgency problems and political conflicts that constantly threatened the peace and stablity of the fledgling democracy. While ethnic minorities demanded autonomy/federalism, the communist insurgents demanded a replacement of parliamentary democracy. The military, reluctant to concede federal demands, eventually took power in a coup in 1962.

This paper looks at the implementation of the scheme in Karnataka, drawing on a large survey of eligible households and interviews with empanelled hospitals in the state. Six months after initiation in early 2010, an impressive 85% of eligible households in the sample were aware of the scheme, and 68% had been enrolled. However, the scheme was hardly operational and utilisation was virtually zero. A large proportion of beneficiaries were yet to receive their cards, and many did not know how and where to obtain treatment under the scheme. Moreover, hospitals were not ready to treat RSBY patients. Surveyed hospitals complained of a lack of training and delays in the reimbursement of their expenses. Many were refusing to treat patients until the issues were resolved, and others were asking cardholders to pay cash. As is typical for the implementation of a government scheme, many of the problems can be related to a misalignment of incentives.

However, the new "advice" comes with so many conditions and guidelines that the developing countries have rejected the recommendations and sent the IMF back to the drawing board. Rather than telling developing countries what to do and when, the IMF should perhaps focus more on helping governments enforce capital controls and it should stress the need for the global coordination of those controls.

The State enacts, implements, and adjudicates policies in our name, and governs in our name.

This essay points out that the Qur'anic injunction against interest refers to the practice of exploitative usury and not bank interest. There are a few practical and realistic alternatives to functioning outside the modern international banking system, which is based on interest payments. The so-called Islamic banks in India only hoodwink depositors by paying them no interest while profiting from investing their money elsewhere for interest.

Using the data generated from a baseline survey on a sample of 6,990 households covering six districts, this paper attempts to assess the relationships between agriculture, food security and nutrition for children, adolescents and married women of reproductive age. The study indicates that (i) overall under-nutrition amongst children, adolescents and married women in the study area is substantial and it does not differ significantly between different socio-economic groups, (ii) higher the food crops production, lower are under-nutrition levels, and (iii) the public distribution system contributes significantly to the food security of poor families and it must be extended to include families above the poverty line as well.

Defining the ideal national character or identity is a matter of political contestation, and so competing visions of nationalism can define the educational curriculum quite differently. In the light of this understanding, this study of textbooks maps how the conceptual triad of nation, education and gender is reflected in textbook content. It explores the historical (and from this, political) context of the languages and how this influences the vision of the nation that particular language textbooks create. It also examines how this historical context is reflected in the physical and emotional landscapes conjured up in the different language textbooks; in the way the other - the Muslim - is constructed.

Law-making bodies in other countries offer examples of how they can be made to work - such as the informal, behind-the -scenes work of the ethics commissioner in Canada and the explicit and vast list of prohibitions in the United States. While India can, and should, develop a system that will best suit its unique needs, it is clear that a more enforceable, practical system for dealing with conflict of interest is needed. Public disclosure of interests - including investments, employment and business ties - for members of both houses would be a constructive and trust-building first step.

It totally ignores the patient's interests and turns on the legal concept of "next friend". This concept is in the context of a person who is unable to maintain a suit on her own behalf due to disability and is akin to a "guardian" legally representing a "minor". The Court considered the nursing staff to be Shanbaug's "next friend". The total denial of recognition of the right to autonomy and self-determination of a person incompetent to consent, and the usurpation by guardians or the State of determining the best interests of the patient is a hazardous course of action.

Judicial reasoning tends to accord an inordinate degree of importance to an absolutist reading of the "sanctity of life" principle. But this tenet has already been compromised to such an extent as to render its continued influence tenuous at best. Moreover, the ethical and jurisprudential foundation for extending the right to die to encompass assisted suicide or active euthanasia in controlled circumstances already exists in the present framework. However, patients incapable of ending their lives are unjustly pre-empted from availing of the right to die in its plenary form.

The strong connection between masculinities and irrigation cultures may provide an important explanation of why hydraulic bureaucracies are so resistant to change. The continued masculinity of irrigation requires critical investigation of masculinities, technology and organisations. Such studies will serve both as a first step to creating more space for women engineers in government water agencies, and contribute to unravelling important aspects of the cultural politics of water.

This paper explores the social, political and environmental implications of not counting girls as household members and drinkers of water. It tries to find answers to the following questions: What are the implications of girls' non-payment for the cost of drinking water in a shared system? What might girls' non-payment mean in terms of the gendered sustainability goals of the project? What are the implications for women's and girls' political subjectivity, especially where natural resources are concerned? The paper also addresses a gap in the political ecology literature with respect to the gender dimensions of neo-liberal processes in the water sector by suggesting a variety of impacts when girls are excluded from water payment.
Vol. 46, No. 18 (APRIL 30-MAY 6, 2011)||review of women's studies||Caste, Gender and the Rhetoric of Reform in India's Drinking Water Sector||DEEPA JOSHI||Recent analyses indicate a historic loss of equity in the shift in India's drinking water policy from a welfarebased, free supply mode to a market-oriented demandled approach. However, a complex entwining of caste and gender has consistently defined water allocation and access among users and entrenched fractures in the structure and culture of the policy-implementing and regulatory institutions. Contrary to popular assumptions, both official welfare-based supply and recent neo-liberal policies and interventions hinge on a tokenistic, segregated and apolitical mention of gender and/or caste concerns which, when translated into action, have often reinforced existing inequities. Based on the above observations, this paper argues that subsequent changes in domestic water policies have only served to exacerbate an enduring unequal social order around water in India.
Vol. 46, No. 18 (APRIL 30-MAY 6, 2011)||review of women's studies||Women and Decentralised Water Governance: Issues, Challenges and the Way Forward||SEEMA KULKARNI||Based on a study of water rights and women's rights in decentralised water governance in Maharashtra and Gujarat, this paper argues that decentralisation will fail to meet its desired objectives unless the value systems, culture and the nature of institutions, including the family, change. While the policy initiative of introducing quotas for women in public bodies is welcome and necessary, it is certainly not sufficient for the success of decentralisation in a society ridden with discrimination based on class, caste and patriarchy, and where the culture of political patronage is dominant. The presence of vibrant social and political movements that propose alternative cultural, social and political paradigms would be a necessary foundation for major social changes. The success of decentralised water governance is constrained by the conceptualisation of the larger reform in water at one level and the notions of the normative woman, community, public and the private domains, and institutions at another. Unless all of these are altered, decentralised processes will not be truly democratic.

It confers legal entitlements on the lands they were cultivating for centuries. This paper looks at various issues with regard to implementation of the Act in the state of Andhra Pradesh. It investigates why the Act emerged in relation to AP. It also reviews the range of forest rights deprivations and how they came about. The authors consider the likely livelihood impact of such a pro-poor institutional reform on the people of the state.

The ingenious ways in which he does this through the aesthetic form of his poetry enables us to décolonise indigenous thinkers, and give them back their ability to articulate their own identities. The material they provide helps us change the terms of the conversation about modernity. It allows us to see a vast array of local narratives from all corners of the world conflicting, intersecting or adding to one another, all contributing to the modernity we live in today.

The share of the corporate sector in industry characteristics such as number of employees, total emoluments, gross output and value added has increased since the early 1990s, with a corresponding decline of the public sector. Moreover, in absolute terms, the manufacturing GDP of the corporate sector grew at a faster rate compared to the public and household sectors since 1999-2000. Indian manufacturing is thus increasingly being led by the private corporate sector. However, the share of compensation to workers and employees in corporate income has steadily declined, pointing to the limited benefits accruing to employees from corporate growth.

On the other hand, the text put out by the Anna Hazare team meets in substantial measure the requirements necessary for a body that can effectively tackle corruption in high places. However, while the government bill is on the spot in seeking to cover only corruption at the top, the Hazare text loses focus by attempting to deal with too many things – bribery, maladministration and misconduct. Where the NGO bill gets it right is in outlining the processes, powers and jurisdiction of the Lokpal. It should now be possible to work towards establishing a constitutionally valid, efficient, workable and sustainable legal mechanism to combat corruption.

But it needs specificity, clarity, well-defined objectives and constitutionally valid methods. Such a separation of powers is essential.

Middle-class students who are backed by certain cultural capital fare relatively better. Cultural capital informs the relationship between schooling and the family/social structure and also shapes the teacher's role in how she or he negotiates with students from different backgrounds. Differing cultural capital is not reflected either in the nature of textbooks or in the nature of the teachers 7 training. This reveals how the question of accessibility to education cannot be limited to access to infrastructure but also includes access to knowledge.

This path was neither a full continuation of the colonial modern nor a restoration of the feudal-traditional. Drawing on progressive ideas from India's "renaissance" and freedom struggle within the Indian "renaissance" and nationalism, this education policy was meant to unleash the potential of India's civilisation by a process of intellectual decolonisation. Unfortunately, in the past few decades, this unfinished agenda has been dumped by successive governments. It has been replaced by an educational policy which prioritises private profit over public good and will encourage cultural and intellectual imperialism.

The decision raises serious questions of economics, politics and the subregional development strategy. For Bangladesh, the key question is no longer whether it should allow transit rights to Indian goods but what is in its best strategic interests. This can only be done after a suitable assessment of the economic and broader strategic issues. At the purely economic level, the most important questions relate to the (a) demand for transit; (b) most suitable modes of transport; (c) time and cost savings, and the benefit sharing between India and Bangladesh. At the strategic level, it is important to understand the deeper concerns of India, the north-eastern states and Bangladesh that have a bearing on the transit debate. There are a number of bilateral issues of national importance that remain unresolved, including watersharing, marine boundary demarcation and insecure borders. Bangladesh has to therefore evaluate its response to the Indian demand for transit based on both economic and strategic considerations. This study is an attempt to combine both kinds of perspectives in order to define Bangladesh's policy response in the wake of the 2010 agreement.

They strove for a new social order by writing and protesting against caste, untouchability, the indignity of the sudras and women, and all exploitative features of the sanskritic order. Puri, the great pilgrimage centre and the heart of Jagannata culture was the nucleus of their movement. It is in their works that we see most clearly the far-reaching transformations in social hierarchy, and what may be called "modernity", which began to take shape in medieval Orissa.

The reforms were expected to result in a high growth rate coupled with a structural change towards high technology industries. This paper analyses data on 60 three-digit industries, reclassified into four technology-intensive subgroups, for the period 1980-81 to 2005-06. Dividing this period into the pre-reform (1980-81 to 1991-92) and the post-reform (1992-93 to 2005-06), the paper uses the single kinked model to reveal a slower trend growth rate of value added for about 77% of the industries in the post-reform period. Further, the study does not find any significant structural transformations within the organised manufacturing sector, which is still dominated by relatively low technology industries. The results thus refute the neo-liberal optimism regarding reforms. In an increasingly technology-driven world, promoting industrialisation isa multidimensional complex task that requires a constructive role of the government.

High mortality among girl children and sex selective abortions have pushed the child sex ratio down in all but three states.

Considering how different commissions and committees set up by the Government of India from time to time have looked at autonomy and accountability, this essay makes the point that there is an interesting interplay between the two and that without them it is virtually impossible to achieve excellence. It argues that the governance structure in all institutions of higher learning should be conducive for consensus making, resulting in both autonomy and accountability. Besides focusing on factors which can significantly contribute to enhancing autonomy, the article argues that effective autonomy cannot descend as a "gift" from above, it has to be earned.

This was a period - covering the pre- and postcrisis years - during which GDP growth was, first, very high and stable, only to be followed by sharp deceleration and then by a quick recovery. This paper sets out to analyse the movement of inflation over these years and the factors underlying the shifts. The policy dilemmas for the government and the central bank are discussed, as also what conventional theory suggests could be the causes and solutions. It concludes with a discussion of the likely challenges in the future.

Questions of timeliness, weights in the price index, accuracy of food price measurement, and inclusion of the prices of services are relevant to the choice of measure. This paper looks at detailed price data, expenditure patterns of households and the composition of different price indices available in India, and discusses policies on inflation measurement in other countries. Under present conditions of measurement, the consumer price index for industrial workers, despite some serious deficiencies, is preferable to both the wholesale price index and the GDP deflator as the headline inflation rate. Thus, macroeconomic analysis and policy thinking need to move away from a focus on the WPI to the CPI-IW.

It is estimated that a total of $213.2 billion was shifted out of India between 1948 and 2008, or about 17.7% of India's GDP at end-2008. Applying rates of return on these assets based on the short-term us Treasury bill rate, the total gross transfers of illicit assets by Indian residents amount to $462 billion at the end of 2008. Over this period, illicit flows grew at a compound nominal rate of 11.5% per annum while in real terms they grew by 6.4% per annum. An important finding is that illicit flows from India are more likely to have been driven by a complex interplay of structural factors and governance issues than they are by poor macroeconomic policies. There are reasons to believe that the cumulative loss of capital is significantly understated because economic models can neither capture all sources for the generation of illicit funds nor the various means for their transfer.

These aggregate trends are used to infer: (a) the dominant relations of production under which the vast majority of the Indian working people labour, and (b) the predominant ways in which the surplus labour of the direct producers is appropriated by the dominant classes. This summary account is meant to inform and link up with ongoing attempts at radically restructuring Indian society. Part I, published this week, covers agriculture, while Part II, to be published next week, inquires into the "informal" industrial sector.
Vol. 46, No. 14 (APRIL 2-8, 2011)||special articles||The Mysterious Alien: Indian Street Jugglers in Victorian London||SUMANTA BANERJEE||During the urbanisation process of London, the imported Asian and African underclass who were brought to London as sailors, servants and nannies among others had become the surplus products, who were born out of the British capitalists' perpetual search for profit. Once their utility was over, they were dismissed by their employers and left stranded in a foreign country. This article examines this tension-ridden interaction between the contemporary English society and certain sections of the Indian immigrant underclass in England in the 19th century. The latter, often by working upon the credulity of their clientele, and sometimes surely by their professional skills in entertainments like jugglery, and in the more serious area of medical treatment, succeeded in occupying an important space in the urban landscape of 19th century England.
Vol. 46, No. 14 (APRIL 2-8, 2011)||special articles||Foreign Direct Investment Caps in India and Corporate Control Mechanisms||K S CHALAPATI RAO and BISWAJIT DHAR||While India has generally been following an open door policy in foreign direct investment, a few areas are still subject to caps on FDI. The need to retain a degree of control over the operations of the investee companies in Indian hands is one of the justifications for the caps. In early 2010, the government specified the methodology for calculating indirect foreign equity in order to remove ambiguities in calculating the extent of FDI in a company. This paper argues that the percentage of shares or proportion of directors on the board does not necessarily represent the extent of control and therefore more direct intervention would be required if the policy objectives are to be achieved.
Vol. 46, No. 14 (APRIL 2-8, 2011)||special articles||The Micro-Politics of Vote Banks in Karnataka||MARY E BREEDING||M N Srinivas coined the term "vote bank" in his 1955 essay, "The Social Structure of a Mysore Village". Today the term -rooted in obligation and reciprocity -is used throughout India by scholars, media personnel and political parties to refer to the exchange of benefits and favours to citizens in return for their political support. Vote banks in Karnataka are reviewed for similarities and differences between the 1955 definition and modern operations in Indian electoral politics. While the structure of vote banks remains largely unaltered, three changes in Indian politics have shaped the meaning of obligation and reciprocity in modern vote banks: the rise of party competition, changes in identity politics, and economic growth and reform.

It is in desperation in the face of mounting casualties that the National Transitional Council has supported the "no-fly zone" demand. The imperative for solidarity with the Libyan rebels is being lost in anti-imperialist polemics, some of which has casually dismissed those Libyans who call for a no-fly zone as naïve or, even worse, as imperial stooges.

The judgments discussed here show that the courts have either reinterpreted the words of the Act to exclude relief in certain categories or cautioned the lower court judges on the procedures to be adopted.

The hostile responses to the film from across generations highlight the discomfort about the portrayal of a raped woman, and its depiction of female and multiple sexualities during the Bangladesh liberation war of 1971. The furore also underscores the nationalist repoliticisation of the younger generation in Bangladesh and its support for the ongoing war crimes tribunal of the 1971 war.

A government-appointed committee (the Rangarajan Committee) has also given its response to these proposals. Both these proposals agree on the desirability of a universal NFSA but finally propose targeting at the poor as defined by the Tendulkar Committee. This has been justified in view of the constraints set by foodgrain procurement and management. This paper argues that a universal NFSA is not only desirable, it is also a more efficient and feasible way to ensure food security for all. While presenting a critique of some of the assumptions made by these two proposals, this paper also offers an alternative which is near universal and feasible without using below poverty line targeting that has proved to be a colossal failure. This alternative, based on the results of a recent pilot for the BPL Census and which takes on board the concerns of its detractors, can be a way forward to a universal NFSA.

After decolonisation, the oilfields not only turned out to be the subject of intense competition in a regional economy, they also came to be identified with the rights of the community, threatening the federal structure and India's development paradigm. This paper is an attempt to locate the history of Assam's oil in the large imperial, global and national political economy. It re-examines the science and polity of petroleum exploration in colonial Assam.

This analysis of various initiativestaken by the government for rural drinking water supply finds that these initiatives do not amount to a comprehensive binding legal framework covering all the main aspects of the fundamental right to water.

But is this enough to turn around a system of behaviour in government and among citizens that has evolved over a long period of time? It is clear that inputs and incentives do not automatically translate into higher participation in education. Within the system, "business as usual" is accompanied by apathy, while new opportunities and innovations seem to generate energy and can activate both citizens and front-line government workers to behave differently.

Ethnographic studies of the mid-20th century identified a variety of dimensions along which caste differentiation occurs. At the same time, whether this differentiation translates into hierarchy remains a contentious issue as does the persistence of caste, given the economic changes of the past two decades. Using data from a nationally representative survey of 41,554 households conducted in 2005, this paper examines the relationship between social background and different dimensions of well-being. The results suggest continued persistence of Caste disparities in education, income and social networks.

Using survey data, it is shown that the methodologies used yield results that misstate the impact. A categorical breakdown is proposed to improve upon these studies, and a simple alternative procedure, the pipeline method, is then estimated to properly correct for selection bias. The results indicate that SHG participation has an impact on assets, livestock income, and salaries. Applying more advanced methods, training is also found to have a positive impact on assets, and empowerment is found to increase with SHG participation.

But there is substantial ambiguity in the conception of these ideas. While women's well-being and women's agency is sufficiently distinguished from each other, there seems to be a large overlap between agency and empowerment and between agency and autonomy. This paper attempts to examine the degree of empowerment and autonomy across different characteristics like place of residence, religion, caste, education, type of employment and wealth quintiles at the individual as well as the regional levels. A regional analysis shows that empowerment may not always lead to autonomy.

Farmers and other landholders are unwilling to relinquish their means of production to capitalists. This has led to a proliferation of pitched battles across India against all kinds of land acquisition. The Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill (2009) and Resettlement and Rehabilitation Bill (2009) therefore need to be examined carefully. The proposed amendments to the Land Acquisition Act will only facilitate the State's new role as the land broker-in-chief. The Resettlement and Rehabilitation Bill will help the Land Acquisition Bill in "rationalising" dispossession by ensuring a more secure and predictable corporate access to land.

It is also an example of the new patterns of segregation of India's urban population on class and ethno-religious lines albeit by using the politically correct language of landownership rights. The affected Muslims, while reacting with moral outrage, also used the language of rights, and of tenure as the main plank of their counteroffensive.

Looking ahead, it points out that the ILO and India face common challenges arising from the increasing inequalities caused by globalisation, the difficulty of implementing a universal social and labour policy in an economy where the bulk of workers are outside the formal sector, and the need to better integrate social and economic policy across different arms of government. These problems call for improved patterns of organisation, influence and dialogue at the national level, but they also define an international agenda for the ILO.

The contribution that the agency can make to a member country regarding employment generally takes the form of assistance in developing approaches, strategies and programmes, rather than direct action. As such, it has significantly influenced Indian policy on the subject. On the other hand, the ILO has gained substantially from India's expertise and experience in formulating its own approaches and applying them to employment promotion policies and programmes in other developing countries. The collaboration, mostly in the realm of ideas, has thus been fruitful for both and perhaps for the rest of the world as well.

Despite what its mandate would suggest the ILO (like India) has chosen to treat only certain selected rights as "fundamental" at the expense of issues such as those relating to conditions of work, wages and social security, which are equally constitutive of what it terms "decent work". This paper argues that recent developments within the ILO and India indicate the need for adopting a broader and more inclusive approach to ensuring decent work.

Hindi media has played a vital role in creating an alternative public discourse which has definitely changed conditions, if not by displacing the extant public sphere, then by putting regional issues on par with national issues.

VEERAMANI and GORDHAN K SAINI||This study analyses the impact of the ASEAN-India Preferential Trade Agreement on plantation commodities - coffee, tea and pepper - using the SMART and gravity models. This reveals that the agreement may cause a significant increase in India's imports of plantation commodities from the ASEAN countries, which is mostly driven by trade creation rather than trade diversion. The proposed tariff reduction may lead to some loss of tariff revenue to the government. However, the gains in consumer surplus outweigh the loss in tariff revenue resulting in a net welfare gain. Simulations based on both the models yield broadly similar results regarding the magnitude of total increase in imports. During the years to come, the plantation sector will have to realign the production structure according to the changing price signals. It is thus important to devise appropriate adjustment assistance schemes for plantation workers who might face displacement.

The Indian jute industry has been globally significant since colonial times and enjoyed a "major industry" status. Under globalisation it is found that the key structural ratios like labour productivity, capital intensity and total factor productivity have been increasing. But the falling trend of capital productivity with low growth of capitaloutput ratio signifies the general deterioration of the quality of investment and its improper utilisation over time. The lower ratio of value added to output also indicates the use of cost-ineffective technology by the industry. At the organisational level, this low value added to output also signifies smaller factory sizes and increasing horizontal integration within the sector.

Vol. 46, No. 9 (FEBRUARY 26-MARCH 4, 2011)||plagiarism in indian academia||Karaoked: Plagiarism in the Classroom||DHANWANTI NAYAK||Contemporary culture is plagiaristic in many ways as culture itself is sustained through copying and imitation. Prevailing plagiaristic practices can be linked to other facets such as the world of work, increased use of technology, teaching-learning practices in the arts, and popular culture in which copying and imitation are integral parts. This article explores how some of these practices influence student "plagiarism" in academic institutions. It also argues that plagiarism cannot be embedded in a discourse of morality and suggests some simple, pragmatic ways in which these can be overcome in the Indian context.

Subjective Expectations on Education in Rural India||ANNEMIE MAERTENS||This paper presents the first results of a study conducted on subjective expectations that parents have about the costs and returns to education. This is done by using a detailed child-level dataset from the three villages of Dokur (Mahbubnagar district, Andhra Pradesh), Kalman and Shirapur (Sholapur district, Maharashtra). The perceived returns differ by region, gender of the child and caste, with girls and members of the scheduled caste and the tribe categories being at a disadvantage.

This poses new difficulties for agricultural development at a time when there is a scarcity of labour as well as profits. The present stagnation in the state's agricultural sector has come at a time when its non-agricultural sector has been growing at more than 9% per annum. In this sense, the current challenge of rejuvenating Kerala's agriculture is of a qualitatively different kind in its developmental history. This paper probes the issue and puts forth a set of measures that are needed to meet the problem head-on.

In spite of continuous efforts towards improving the methodology of the BPL census, a significant difference between the "estimated" and the "identified" poor still persists. Against this backdrop, this paper attempts to develop an alternative method based on "vulnerability criteria" for the identification of the poor. Estimation shows that the prescribed criteria not only reduce the exclusion error significantly, but also suggest inclusion of a larger number of vulnerable households in the BPL list. Because of the data limitations, this exercise remains tentative. Nevertheless, it sets the possibility of further exploration to address the issue of large-scale errors.

Yet today, countries such as Bangladesh possess some of the most productive, mechanised and labour-intensive agricultural industries in south Asia. This paper reopens these debates in the light of: (1) the highly diverse patterns of rural mechanisation that have taken place in Bangladesh, India and Nepal since the 1980s; (2) current renewed interest in rural employment and rural economic growth; and (3) changes in global trade patterns.

Thus, despite efforts by the University Grants Commission to introduce guidelines and regulations relating to academic performance of teachers in colleges and universities, the non-availability of academic resources and a hierarchical research structure have reduced the standards of research activity and further encouraged academic dishonesty.

The Naps has seen a lukewarm response so far, with a majority of subscribers being central and state government employees, for whom the scheme is mandatory. An analysis of the auto choice option under the Naps and the demographic transition reveals potential future imbalances in the investment structure among the asset classes. Moreover, the Naps does not even guarantee a minimum pension, thus defeating its "welfare" orientation.

Vol. 46, No. 8 (FEBRUARY 19-25, 2011)||special articles||Women's Health, Population Control and Collective Action||HARINI NARAYANAN||Health policy in India, like all public policy, has always been the product of complex political processes. In the area of women's health, the situation is further complicated by the fact that policy processes have to straddle a treacherous fault line between target-driven population-control goals on the one hand, and issues of individual reproductive rights and general well-being on the other. Most recent discussions of women's health policy in India argue that over time, such policies and the programmes associated with them are today more inclusive and sensitive to the articulated and apparent needs of the women concerned than they earlier were. Through a historical study of the relevant policymaking processes and discussions with those who intervene in such processes, this paper seeks to widen the debate on the subject by questioning the above views. Further, the paper argues that the trajectory of change has never been simple or linear. Policy shifts over time reflect the greater or lesser influence of a range of actors – including international donor agencies and pharmaceutical companies as well as the health and women's movements – apart from the ideological aims of the party in power. All these influences serve to constantly blur and shift the loci of policy emphases along non-linear trajectories, even if the core concerns remain relatively unchanged.

This has contributed to the increase in India's overall savings rate. Using firm level data of public limited companies for the period 1998-99 to 2006-07, this paper employs a random effects model to study the determinants of private corporate sector savings. The empirical results of the panel regression indicate that corporate tax rate, availability of external funds, cost of borrowings, interest burden and value of production as a percentage of manufacturing expenses are the major determinants of corporate savings during the period. Dividing the sample into large and small firms based on their sales in 2006-07, we find that the significance of determinants varies considerably between these two firm groups.
Vol. 46, No. 8 (FEBRUARY 19-25, 2011)||special articles||Monuments, Memory and Forgetting in Postcolonial North-East India||JANGKHOMANG GUITE||This paper looks at how "official" memories are produced in state-sponsored public spaces and how a multi-ethnic, multicultural north-east India responded to it. Official memory sites like museums, monuments and memorials not only reflected but also shaped ethnic relations to a great extent. The emerging states in the region have assiduously favoured the historical imagination of a politically dominant community, which is masculine, and remains persistently insensitive to the marginal "others" in the state. This, on the one hand, encouraged the dominant community to assimilate and thereby produced ethnonationalism around that notion of shared pasts. On the other, it generated a sense of neglect in the minorities who responded with vernacular memorials to embody their historical imagination and likewise developed their own ethnic nationalism around it. This parallel rise to prominence of often competing ethnonationalisms within the region, or sometime within the state, has thereby produced violent forms of contestation often dangerously imbued with fissiparous tendencies.

But this "stability" came at a high cost for many Egyptians. Hosni Mubarak's regime was founded on the belief that keeping Egypt safe from the threat of religious extremism, terrorism and regional strife required a coercive security state that could suppress any political unrest through force and intimidation. That "stability" has now unfolded. This, however, has not been a sudden event. It has been brewing for a few years, with the timing and strategies of the democratic uprising growing out of a series of social and political mobilisations, which laid the groundwork for what flared up on 25 January.

It started a decade back with the coming together of political activists from the opposed streams of Islamic and secular political activism and has been nurtured through a vibrant and creative political practice which has relied heavily on the tools of new communication technologies and social media. This has not only helped create a new political public in Egypt, it has helped moderate the radical extremes which kept Mubarak's opposition divided.

Declaring a need-based minimum wage rate under NREGA which is linked to the schedule of rates allows for sufficient flexibility to account for regional/geographical variation.

In the process, presenting the success of the railways as a reflection of the policies of a political party in power or even of the personality of the railway minister has become a routine in which everybody plays a willing part. The party in power, the railway minister, and the officials of the ministry then find little option, in lean years, but to continue the window-dressing, the half truths and sham accounting.

However, reform of this nature involving both the centre and the states is an experiment in cooperative federalism and requires stewardship by statesmen. Resumption of GST reform requires greater recognition of and sensitivity to the views of the states. The IMF-type "one size fits all" reform, as has been recommended by the Thirteenth Finance Commission, could simply stall the process. At the same time, while it is legitimate for the states to bargain to retain their fiscal autonomy, they should not use this autonomy to indulge in predatory competition and export the tax burden to non-residents.
Vol. 46, No. 7 (FEBRUARY 12-18, 2011)||special articles||Determinants of Export Decision of Firms||T N SRINIVASAN and VANI ARCHANA||This paper contributes to the more recent strand in the analysis of trade flows that uses data on exports of individual firms. In all countries of the world, relatively few firms participate in world trade, thus suggesting that besides country level barriers to trade, characteristics of a firm such as its size and productivity are relevant for participation in trade. Using firm level data, this study attempts to model and estimate the decision of Indian firms on their participation in trade. Firm heterogeneity is an important determinant of the decision to export. Exporting firms are significantly larger, more R&D-intensive, low wage-intensive, more productive and more profitable than non-exporting firms. The multinomial results reveal that the probability of survival of new firms in export markets is lower when compared to those which have been exporting in the previous years.

This empirical analysis signifies the concerns for the livelihoods of farmers, when the cost of depletion is disproportionately borne by the resource-poor farmers as they are unable to invest in capital and technology and are hence denied the benefits of groundwater irrigation that is subsidised by free electricity. This situation is perpetuated with further scarcity leading to unequal economic returns and, finally, takes the most exploitative form where the "large landlords" also emerge as "water lords" through surplus accumulation, forcing the small and marginal landholders to become landless agricultural labourers.

However dire the mutual needs of nations that face a water crisis, they are also caught in a vortex of geopolitical forces.

Through a close analysis of the way these two films engage with homosexuality and its representations, and by a discussion of the history of gay themes in Hindi popular cinema, this article tries to argue that while mainstream films are now able to foreground homosexual desire, they do this through an erasure of the female.

The decision-making system is seen to be ad hoc, and not sufficiently transparent or participative. The DPR suffers from serious methodological and analytical errors, and has exaggerated the benefits from the proposed project. This analysis, along with the experience from other cities, suggests that cities are increasingly seeking single large, big-budget solutions to their urban transport problems without exploring the many simpler, cheaper and more effective options available.

Though the film deals with similar issues of crime, corruption in police and politics, and rural poverty as its predecessors, it adopts a different attitude. While acknowledging corruption in the institutions of the State, it still treats it with much greater respect and depicts politics as a space in which hope still exists.

Whatever the overt reasons given for grouping, what underlies it is the assumption that all people in a given area, whether civilian or combatant, are potentially hostile. Grouping is thus an act of war rather than effective counter-insurgency. This article describes the process of grouping, forced labour, surveillance and starvation in the camps. While descriptions of the process of grouping are consistent, people's opinions vary on its implications for their own lives, depending on their past and current location.

While natural rubber productivity has grown rapidly, that of coconuts has barely increased over time. This paper seeks an explanation for this differential performance in terms of relative rates of diffusion of new technologies facilitated by their respective Sectoral Systems of Innovation. The SSI of rubber consists of an articulated regulatory policy mechanism which ensured that the new technologies that were generated by the research arm of the regulatory body itself were adopted by the farmers. Contrary to this, in coconuts there appear not much evidence of diffusion of new technologies and its SSI is characterised by a lack of cohesiveness with a multiplicity of actors operating at sub-optimal scales. However, some concerted efforts have been made over the last 10 years or so to develop new technologies and its diffusion among farmers and this has started bearing fruit in the form of increases in productivity, specifically since 1995-96.

Several factors were involved in the rise of disability movements in the late 1980s and 1990s. Among these was a much more accountable state policy, the strong presence of women's movements, and the interest and push of international agencies, the presence of which created a more conducive space for the political mobilisation of marginalised groups such as the disabled. The passing of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 owes much more to international pressure than to lobbying and protests by disability rights groups. The disability rights movement in India is still trying to register its presence in the public sphere. It has, however, undoubtedly touched the lives of masses of disabled persons and pushed for a more disabled-friendly environment in the country.

While this process generated an environment for the proletarianisation of women on a global scale and facilitated the corporations in minimising their responsibilities towards labour, it also affected the bargaining capacity of labour. Eventually women proletarians started organising and registering their resistance. Women's non-governmental organisations and transnational feminist networks came forward to facilitate the women proletarians' movement against the dominant mode of production. This movement, however, was more inclined towards "quiet" resistance. This article analyses the significance of this "quiet revolution".

The central argument of the paper is that it is imperative that we look at the entire system of food production, food procurement and the release and distribution of food. Trying to correct one segment of this complicated system is likely to end in failure. The paper argues that there are two different motives for foodgrain procurement by the state – to provide food security to the vulnerable and to even out foodgrain price fluctuations from one year to another. Further, how we procure the food has an impact on how we release the food, and vice versa. Inspired by the sight of foodgrains going waste, it is often made out to be that our central problem is that of poor foodgrain storage. This paper disagrees with this popular view. While we no doubt should improve our storage facilities, it is important to be clear that this in itself will not lower the price of food. To achieve that we need to redesign the mechanics of how we acquire and release food on the market.

Thus, the virtue of the righteous person must carry over into equitable relationships, which, in turn, must sustain this virtue. Together these must facilitate just distributive social institutions and set the norms and values for just social structures, even as these structures must bring about fair distribution and just institutions, sustained by equitable relationships and personal virtue.

This paper analyses the present urban development policies with a focus on coverage at the state and size-class levels, the extent of equity and effectiveness of the programme. It works out the interdependencies of infrastructural investment in the public sector with those of socio-economic indicators. The study shows that only 58% of the urban population has been covered under JNNURM, the coverage being high in the developed states and metropolitan cities. Of the 5,161 towns/cities, 4,207 are yet to be covered. An analysis of the funding pattern clearly brings out the big city bias. The phenomenon of large-scale underutilisation of the funds and inability of the smaller urban local bodies to prepare detailed project reports and generate matching resources can be addressed by making special provisions for unconditional general grants, especially those in the economically backward states. This will certainly help in making the growth process more inclusive, where the urban poor would be partners in the developmental process.

The concept of swaraj does not merely address the question of self-rule versus foreign rule or state rule versus anarchy, rather it questions the very presuppositions of sovereignty as constituted in the modern nation state. In that way Gandhi not only presents a fundamentally different theory of the relation between civil society and the state but also of the two constitutive principles of modern theories of sovereignty – supreme authority and territory.

Forest rights implementation has been sluggish with rampant violations and large-scale denial of rights, mostly by the forest bureaucracy, the revenue and tribal departments. An analysis of the legal provisions under various Acts reveals that none of the 39 notified Critical Tiger Habitats have obtained the consent of the forest dwellers and the gram sabhas, and are thus illegal. An elitist conservation policy, which has so far targeted only the tribals, has resulted in illegal encroachment and activities in the tiger reserves by the State.

Tribes of India in a Long-term Demographic Perspective||ARUP MAHARATNA||Although the demography of tribal people cannot loom large in India's overall demographic scene, demographic features in tribal societies have often been distinct and distinguished both in historical and comparative perspectives. This evaluation of the overall demographic features and their common sociocultural underpinnings in the tribal population focuses on the nature and strength of the well-known connection between sociocultural milieus and demographic behaviour. It highlights the Indian notion of "tribe" and its comparative position vis-à-vis the mainstream since the late last century, especially in the contemporary context of development and globalisation.

With the completion period drawing to a close in 2012, this paper critically evaluates the success of the intervention strategies under this scheme. Based on rapid appraisal surveys in selected districts, three common review missions by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, and data reported on the NRHM website, this paper attempts a desk review of the progress of the mission with respect to its core strategies – provisioning of health services to households through accredited social health activists, strengthening rural public health facilities, enhancing capacity of panchayats to control and manage provisioning of health services and positioning of an effective health management information system.

The unit-wise Annual Survey of Industries and the National Sample Survey Organisation 62nd round data for 2005-06 cover the entire manufacturing data, but the results derived for variables such as value added, output, fabric production, etc, are also not considered reliable as the small units have a tendency to under-report their production in order to retain the benefits of small-scale sector tax incentives. This paper presents an analysis of the National Council of Applied Economic Research sample survey, which was designed to estimate the weighted per unit ratios for various size classes of units belonging to the handloom, powerloom/mill and knitting sectors.

This note suggests that in at least one specific and restricted area of application – the intersection of poverty, inequality and growth – it should be possible to capture some elementary aspect of inclusiveness by monitoring trends, set against targets, of the "quintile income" statistic. This statistic, which was proposed in earlier work by Kaushik Basu, is a simple and useful aid to verifying the reach of inclusiveness in a specific dimension of development, a theme that is elaborated on in this note.

We also need to understand how to increase and sustain the capability of people, economies and nature to deal with change. And for this, science, policy and practice need to fashion modes of working together. They are themselves three components of a structure that can help us to move forward in a sustainable and dynamic manner. The argument here is that a systems approach using some notions from resilience theory will provide pointers towards how this can happen.

The Indian Evidence||ANKITA MISHRA and RANJAN RAY||Notwithstanding the wide recognition that movements in relative prices and inequality affect welfare comparisons between households, there is a dearth of literature incorporating them in welfare analysis. Changes in relative prices open up a divergence between nominal and real expenditure inequalities that will persist even if all nominal expenditures are deflated by a household invariant price index. In a period of rising inequality, a comparison of summary welfare measures based on mean or median expenditure, even if inflation adjusted, will give us a misleading picture of changes in living standards. This paper provides evidence for India in the post-reform period. The results confirm that in a period of significant relative price changes and rising inequality, the omission of these factors leads to overstatement of the welfare gains. Another observation is that relatively affluent states do not do all that well if we focus on inequality or on their food consumption alone.

While there have been significant gains in these two areas, women continue to be under-represented in legislative bodies both at the national and state level and in political parties. An analysis of the factors influencing participation reveals that these differ for women in elections as voters and their involvement as campaigners. All said and done, positive affirmative action in the form of reservation in legislative bodies, greater accommodation of women in decision-making positions in political parties and in government would go a long way in addressing a serious lacuna in politics in the country.

Farmers in semi-arid regions actively manage fertility and other soil properties through a wide range of practices that are based on local resources and knowledge. Empirical data reveals farmers' soil fertility management options are being undermined by government policies that give more priority to chemical fertiliser-based strategies. It is argued that equal importance should be accorded to farmers using organic and farmers using inorganic methods. By doing so, we not only maintain the soil in a healthy condition but also support the livelihoods of millions, especially small and marginal farmers.

However, due to unseasonal rains, the production of onions declined by about 20% in the three major growing states during 2009-10 and 2010-11. The recent sharp rise in the prices of onions can be attributed to a decline in kharif production on account of unseasonal rains at harvest time in the major onion producing states, a reduction in the minimum export price and consequent increase in exports during November 2010 and a holding back of stocks by traders.

Strategies to respond to groundwater overuse and deteriorating water quality must be based on a new approach involving typologising the resource problems and redefining the institutional structure governing groundwater. This approach is based on the notion of groundwater as common property. The complex nature of groundwater problems in India implies that a detailed understanding of regimes in different hydrogeological settings and socio-economic situations is the prerequisite for sustainable and equitable management. Further, the management strategies should be specified keeping aquifer-scales in mind. For the adoption of this new approach, reforms are needed in how we assess groundwater resources, map aquifers, monitor quality and in the legal and institutional framework for groundwater governance. A national programme of groundwater management based on this process-specific approach is needed to address the challenge.

Indian small and medium enterprises in food and other agriculture-related products, some intermediate goods, and light manufacturing products are also likely to suffer. But import liberalisation in intermediate goods will encourage multinational corporations to undertake production rationalisation across the region in the transport equipment, machinery, chemicals and iron and steel sectors. This could lead to India's deeper integration in production networks in such sectors. All this, combined with the neglect of the development needs of domestic agriculture and a manufacturing base for the expected gains in service sector liberalisation with ASEAN, is likely to make India's employment and livelihood issues even more challenging.

Although MNES brought their subcontractors from their home countries during the 1980s, they started procurement from local suppliers to meet the targets of local content. Local suppliers accumulated relation-specific skills through subcontracting. As the domestic demand expanded rapidly in the 1990s, production volume exceeded the level required for subcontractors to secure economies of scale. More foreign assemblers and component manufacturers entered the Indian market. Strengthened competition encouraged foreign and local assemblers to improve supply chain management. The econometric estimation in this paper finds a significant and positive correlation between improvement of labour productivity of suppliers and total factor productivity growth rates in six machinery industries. The result of the estimation confirms the effects of backward linkage. Rapid expansion of domestic demand and competition are determinant factors of development of subcontracting. But the range of subcontracting is limited to a part of the organised sector.

By claiming that Lenin had internalised Hegelian dialectics as "the algebra of the revolution", the paper views Leninism as the sublation (Aufhebung) of centralism to mass politics, where organisation and the masses cease to exist as binary halves, but have been synthesised as "the union of free individuals". It encounters two terrains: (1) Marx's revolutionary humanism, and (2) dialectics that views concepts and ideas in the matrix of contradictions and conflicts and thus in permanent-revolutionary transitions. It consequently argues that Leninism has to be seen in the light of Lenin's encounters in the Philosophical Notebooks, rather than in a dogmatic and fetishised understanding of democratic centralism that began with the Stalinist counter-revolution.

The right over the natural resources of Assam has been an issue of contention between the central government and Assam in post-independence India. The discovery of a new oilfield in Assam immediately after independence led to conflicts not only between the Assam and the central governments, but also between the Government of India and the Assam Oil Company and its equity holder, the Burmah Oil Company, since there were moves to nationalise minerals. Though the conflict between Assam and the government of India started over the location of the refinery, the debates in the public sphere and in the Assam legislative assembly raised larger issues like the rights over natural resources, the question of Assam's development and the centre's role in it and the relation between the centre and the state.
