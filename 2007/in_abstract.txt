Shergill||India's food security depends vitally on wheat and rice production in Punjab, which contributes more than 50 per cent of the central pool of cereal Stocks. The sustainability of wheat and rice production at the present scale in Punjab has been questioned by some experts, both on economic and ecological grounds. The evaluation of empirical evidence on economic and ecological aspects of wheat-rice cultivation in Punjab, however, shows that it is quite sustainable: the economics of rotation is sound, a growing domestic market is assured for the next few decades and the minimum support prices Programme will continue in the foreseeable future. The returns are the highest among the competing crop rotation combinations and there is no imminent ecological threat The fall in the water table has neither crossed the danger mark nor has the fall been caused by wheat-rice cultivation per se.

Representations of illegality hide unpleasant social realities of the coal mining tracts: poor environmental performance of the state-owned mining sector, social disruption and displacement of communities, and a general decay in the traditional subsistence base. This paper works through the complex layers of mining laws and investigates whether the laws protect the interests of the disadvantaged. It offers a rethinking of what causes and constitutes illegality when a large number of people's livelihoods depend on this kind of mining.
Vol. 42, No. 39 (Sep. 29 - Oct. 5, 2007)||commentary||Historical Memory without History||Romila Thapar||Questions of identifying location and chronology do bother archaeologists and historians, but they need not be of consequence to those whose concern is only with faith, and the distinction has to be reiterated. What is at issue in the Setusamudram project, however, is not whether Rama existed or not, or whether the underwater formation was originally a bridge constructed at his behest, but a different and crucial set of questions relating to the environmental and economic impact of the project that require neither faith nor archaeology. They require far greater discussion if we are to understand what the project might achieve and what it might destroy.
Vol. 42, No. 38 (Sep. 22 - 28, 2007)||commentary||Reservation for Gujars: A Pastoral Perspective||Purnendu S. Kavoori||The demand for reservation by Gujars is much more than simply a demand for creating more job opportunities. As a pastoral community, the Gujar population has been subjected to a long period of subordination by an insensitive policy orientation. The very process of mainstream development has succeeded in depriving the Gujars of resources and institutions that were fundamental to their survival. The issue of reservation cannot be examined meaningfully without taking into account the larger ecological dislocation that the Gujars have been subjected to.

Vol. 42, No. 35 (Sep. 1 - 7, 2007)||commentary||Role of the State on Forests: Case of Uttarakhand||Nehal A. Farooquee and R. K. Maikhuri||The continuous shrinking of forest area for the rural population and increasing encroachment for bringing more land under infrastructure development, and the cultivation and abandonment of less productive land in Uttarakhand have put the state's rural people in a tough situation. Issues of equity and governance bear the key to a sustainable solution for the escalating ecological crisis in the state.
Vol. 42, No. 35 (Sep. 1 - 7, 2007)||special articles||Health Impact Assessment in Project and Policy Formulation||Arti Ahuja||Health impact assessment is globally gaining widespread credibility and adoption in the policymaking process as it leads to a holistic view of healthcare and informs policy dialogue in a more coherent manner. But in India, this process has not yet begun. This paper looks at the viability and necessity of introducing HIA in policymaking. It also suggests an integration of HIA with environmental impact assessment in order to draw upon the strength of the latter and bring in an integrated approach to the issue of impact assessments and their monitoring.
Vol. 42, No. 30 (Jul. 28 - Aug. 3, 2007)||special articles||Vulnerability to Air Pollution: Is There Any Inequity in Exposure?||Vinish Kathuria and Nisar A. Khan||This study tries to find evidence of environmental inequity by looking into the relationship between socio-economic characteristics and air pollution exposure. This is carried out by first computing a household specific air pollution exposure index for 347 households around seven pollution monitoring stations in Delhi. The index is then used in a multivariate regression to look into the environmental equity aspect. The analysis yields that the economically backward communities are the most affected by the exposure to air pollution. However, the study does not find any evidence of environmental inequity due to religion and social backwardness. Education facilitates defence against the exposure, when it crosses a threshold level. The separate analysis of residential and industrial areas suggests that exposure to air pollution is dependent, though not systematically, on the location of residence, besides socio-economic status.

While the Wildlife Protection Act 1972 does provide for people's rights within sanctuaries, policies regarding protected areas must encourage a partnership between these communities and government agencies.

In the recent past, concern has been expressed about the economic and ecological sustainability of this so-called profitable crop. This study attempts inter alia to understand the rationale of farmers' choice of boro paddy harvest in a situation of declining profitability and growth in output, the impact on groundwater reserves in West Bengal and damage to the soil substrate caused by such monocropping. Despite a dearth of scientific data on the polluting effects of agrochemical dumping, indicators show that a large number of farmers of West Bengal who are growing boro paddy are becoming ecologically handicapped.

Vol. 42, No. 17 (Apr. 28 - May 4, 2007)||commentary||Is India Too Poor to Be Green?||Leah Temper and Joan Martinez-Alier||The argument that the best way for a growing economy to treat environmental problems is to get rich first and clean up the mess later is not defensible. India cannot replicate the processes of the developed west because it can neither shift environmentally damaging activities abroad nor can it "export" surplus labour released from agriculture to Europe or the US.

However, governments pay only lip service to these concerns and the policies adopted in India do not reflect a genuine commitment to sustainable and environmentally conscious clean technology measures.

Among other things, the restrictions on harvesting of surface water in the catchment area of the Gandhi Sagar dam have resulted in huge ecological and social costs to the people of Malwa region in the state. The share of Rajasthan in the net available water from the project is far greater than the water utilised by MP. Since the latter is unable to utilise more water in its area, it should be allowed to utilise its share in the catchment area of Gandhi Sagar.
Vol. 42, No. 3 (Jan. 20-26, 2007)||money market||Effects of Multiple Arbitraging||EPW Research Foundation||The developments in the call money market in December 2006 have exposed the tenuous nature of the financial markets in a possible environment of liquidity shortages. A considerably unequal distribution in investment-deposit ratios creates scope for varied forms of arbitraging. Such arbitraging has been spawned by a situation of vast structural differences between different groups of players in the financial markets. These developments point to the substantially changed market structure, wherein arbitraging operations between markets, which are generally believed to remove misalignment of rates, have instead increased disparities.
Vol. 42, No. 2 (Jan. 13-19, 2007)||commentary||Some Good News in Power Sector||Prayas Energy Group||The successful bids for two ultra-mega power projects in Sasan and Mundra indicate that competitive bidding could be used to procure power at low rates and that the UMPPs may help reduce inefficiencies in coal operations. However, such projects should be undertaken with caution so as to minimise adverse social and environmental impacts and increasing dependence on coal.
