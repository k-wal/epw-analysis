These were not new ideas; they merely recycled earlier proposals made by the United States and the European Union. The imbalances in the texts explain why Lamy's bid to have another ministerial meeting in mid-December failed.

In comparison to Jharkhand, administrative steps taken in Rajasthan since 2002, when the Sahariyas (another tribal community) faced starvation deaths in that state, show how this vulnerability can be tackled.

The objective is to indicate how the property rights debate overlaps the argument about social costs of transition, including widening income inequality, environmental devastation, and so on.

The most positive consequence of industrialisation has been its contribution to absolute poverty reduction, especially in the coastal provinces. Much less clear is whether migration - mainly from west to east and driven by rural industrialisation - has contributed to poverty reduction in the interior. For, remittances have accrued mainly to the relatively well off rather than to the rural poor. More negatively, counties which were large exporters of labour have suffered a skill drain. However, the main adverse effect of rural industrialisation has been its exacerbation of spatial inequality, which has also resulted in a rise of inequalities in per capita GDP among China's counties.

It focuses on the country's regional and healthcare policies to illustrate how it has dealt with issues of inequality and insecurity over time. The prevailing view now is that the market is necessary but it must be embedded in society. And the state must play an active role in the market economy to prevent a disembedded and self-regulating market economy from dominating society.

A "new" China has emerged, economically powerful, showcased by the Olympics and spurred by nationalistic sentiments. But beneath this shiny surface there is growing polarisation between those with extreme wealth at the top and hundreds of millions in the working classes who have lost power and face a bleak struggle for survival in the global capitalist market. Despite ameliorative measures by the current leadership, there is no fundamental plan to reverse this ever widening divide. In the face of the deepening global economic crisis, these divisions are swelling. China is suffering its most severe downturn in decades, and working class protests are spreading. The Chinese left is re-emerging, but remains largely isolated from these popular forces. Only by beginning to bridge that gap, can China once again find a socialist alternative.

The persistence of a mixed economic system despite market reforms further contradicts the orthodox doctrines of globalisation. This study argues that China's economic transformation has been mainly based on productivity improvement and is thus to a significant extent a real development. It has been achieved mainly through a process of "governing the market" by a set of structural-institutional factors that are China-specific but can be of general importance for late development worldwide.

Agricultural growth rates have however declined in the last decade or so, the reasons for which have been elaborated upon. A gradual movement towards unorganised labour has characterised working patterns in the state and the phenomenon is studied, along with the conditions of living. In this context, the new economic policy of the Left Front government is critiqued. It is suggested that a policy that favours inclusive growth with greater emphasis on small enterprises should be followed by the government if it wants to sustain the gains made and address the shortcomings in the state.

The plan aims to raise post-monsoon groundwater levels to three metres below ground level through annual "managed artificial recharge" of 36.4 km 3 by constructing some four million spreading-type recharge structures at a cost of Rs 25,000 crore. While this is a step in the right direction, the revised master plan under preparation needs to incorporate socio-economic, institutional and administrative parameters that underpin the implementation of any major change intervention. This paper provides an assessment of the existing plan and offers suggestions for revision.

This restricted their appeal to middle class women since it was economic issues that were more important for women from the lower classes. It was only when the groups began taking up the latter issues, aligning with left trade unions in some cases and acknowledging political differences among themselves, did they start attracting women from different socio- economic, ethnic and religious categories.

The 27 per cent reservation to the Other Backward Classes is likely to intensify the demands of these communities.

One solution is to monitor investment banks and hedge funds and subject them to regulation while seeking an institutional solution that would protect the core of the financial structure, the banking system. The bail out implemented in the us and some of the west European countries has been forced to take a form that perhaps provides the basis for such a transformation. Governments have opted for state ownership and direct influence over decision-making. Will this be temporary or a new form of banking regulation?

They expect politics to reflect their aspirations and respond to their anxieties. They want politics to represent them since they assume that they represent India. This disconnect leads to constant suspicion of and cynicism about the politician. This is what underlies the tirade against politicians after the Mumbai horrors.

This essay, begins with a comparison of the two and then carries out a critical analysis of the second version. Whilst the draft covers almost all aspects of importance that concern tribal societies, what it lacks is the "tribal voice". Throughout its length runs the "we-they" distinction - the distinction of "givers" and "receivers". We hear the voice of bureaucrats, planners, and development specialists, which constitutes the dominant discourse on tribes. The article argues that the tribal issues should come more to the centre of our discussions in contemporary India than remaining at the margins, as is the case today.

The Left Front government in West Bengal, in competition with other states for the location of Tata Motors' Nano automobile complex, fell overboard in offering subsidies to the company. Further, the government did not scrutinise the quantum of land demanded by the company, blundered by offering highly fertile land in Singur, and compounded its mistake by invoking the Land Acquisition Act, thereby compelling landowners to surrender their land at a low price. Its compensation formula was biased in favour of non-cultivating absentee landowners, and grossly unfair to the actual cultivators, bargadars and agricultural labourers, giving rise to concerted opposition from peasants and their supporters.

Firmly based in their respective local cultures and world views and using the form of narrative transculturation, these two novels from the global South help develop a critical consciousness of colonial and neocolonial modernity.

Godaan presents a moving human document and social panorama but Six Acres considerably deepens the "referential" function of its own discourse by rewriting reference as "epistemic access" to the structures of domination. The novel of a tyrant and of a tyrannical system thus becomes the product of a complicit social ideology and discourse, encouraging scepticism about what is given. It problematises the real so that the rules of this world can be rewritten, unlike Godaan, which settles for the familiar reality of psychodrama.

The struggle against terrorism requires us not only to keep our nerves but also to keep our heads. A far more productive approach would be bilateral, multilateral and United Nations-sanctioned diplomatic pressures on Pakistan to act on domestic terror groups. How the us and UK followed up on the Lockerbie bombing of 1988 and forced Libya to abandon state-sponsored terrorism is a relevant example. The options offered by UN Resolution 1373 constitute a related approach.

This unprecedented scale of deregulation and the concomitant absence of systemic risk controls were facilitated by a radically lopsided political economy in the North. This was, in turn, held up by an extremely lopsided global division of labour. Exportsurplus-fuelled liquidity and excessive deregulation combined to exacerbate the cyclical nature of banking systems that follow from the credit nature of money, leading to massive booms and searing busts. Layer upon unstable layer, these interacting dynamics have imperilled our world system and brought us to the brink. Each dynamic will now have to be rebalanced, a difficult political task.

However, despite these changes, the sexual and reproductive health of women continues to be an area of concern. This paper examines the socio-cultural determinants to women's health in Rajasthan in the light of the National Family Health Survey-3 data as well as the current policies and programmes affecting women's health. It asserts that in the present context, women's bodies, health and sexuality are being grossly neglected and abused in Rajasthan and there is a dire need for reform in the state's attitude towards women's health needs.

In terms of monthly data, each observation of a one- year change in inflation is the sum of 12 one-month changes. This suggests that better information about inflationary pressures can be obtained using point-on-point monthly changes. This requires seasonal adjustment. We apply standard seasonal adjustment procedures in order to obtain a point- on- point seasonally adjusted monthly time-series of inflation in India. In three interesting high inflation episodes– 1994-95,2007 and 2008 – we find that this data yields a faster and better understanding of inflationary pressures.

This instability is a result of an investment-growth asymmetry that flows from a combination of a services-intensive growth pattern and a manufacturing-intensive investment pattern, which reflects the pattern of demand expansion within the domestic economy as well as in external markets, as also reliance on private corporate investment as the driver of the economy's investment process. In such circumstances, maintaining the balance between capacity creation and demand expansion in the manufacturing sector becomes impossible. Investment is thus prone to a high degree of instability, which, via its effects on demand, makes industrial growth too highly unstable. The services-intensive growth trajectory after 1991 is therefore more correctly viewed as one which is unable to fully utilise the capital accumulation potential of the economy rather than as a trajectory that is cheap in the use of capital. Correcting this problem however requires measures that are inconsistent with a liberalised economic policy regime.

Now is the time in those countries for a socio-ecological transition to lower levels of energy and materials use. The crisis might also give an opportunity for a restructuring of social institutions. The objective in rich countries should be to live well without the imperative of economic growth.

James||The three rounds of the National Family Health Survey have generated vast amounts of data, which unfortunately have been subject to only limited critical examination by Indian research scholars, though the opposite is the case with scholars outside India. The NFHS–3, which was conducted in 2005-06, covered many more areas than the previous surveys and collected information in new and sensitive areas like sexual behaviour. However, there are questions about the quality of data thrown up by NFHS–3. Information on some indicators such as fertility and infant mortality remains of reasonably good quality, but the data on nutrition, immunisation, and gender violence is suspect. There have been three of these very large surveys since 1992–93, and it is perhaps time to reflect on the experience so far and plan for the next survey a decade after NFHS–3 which would be five years after the 2011 Census.

It also discusses potential problems associated with the sibling data being derived from the retrospective fertility histories of mothers.

Kulkarni||Analysis of the data from the three rounds of India's National Family Health Survey shows that fertility transition is continuing in all the major religious groups of India. Substantial declines have occurred in fertility over the period encompassing the three rounds. The use of contraceptives has become more widely prevalent with a majority of couples wanting to stop childbearing at two or three children. Spatial variation is also noticeable with religious differentials being very small or negligible in some states. At the national level, religious differentials are narrowing though it is difficult to say when a convergence could occur. However, fertility for all religious groups is expected to fall further towards the replacement level and possibly to below this level.

At the national level, reported premarital sex is still fairly low among women and somewhat higher among men. The data show that ever married women are more likely to report premarital sex compared to currently unmarried women. Among unmarried women and men who report premarital sexual activity, the distributions vary by place of residence, occupational status, level of education, and level of household wealth. Unmarried women who are aware of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases are less likely to have had premarital sex. Notably, there is a significant gender dimension in reporting of premarital sexual activity, pointing the way for further research.

It shows that a significant proportion of women, regardless of their socio-economic background, accept power differentials based on sex and that men have a right to discipline them. It also reveals that men from violent homes are significantly more likely to use violence against their wives. Most women do not seek help for the violence suffered, and the few who do, tend to steer clear of social service organisations and the authorities.

Mohanty||The household deprivation scores, based on the availability of some basic amenities to a household and the presence of a literate adult member, have been applied to data sets of the three National Family Health Surveys to study the trends in deprivation levels over 1992-2006 and the correlates of selected reproductive and child heath parameters with household deprivation levels. It is found that the proportion of households classified as "deprived" on the basis of the HDS has recorded a secular declining trend over this period and that the quantum of decline in the proportions of the deprived is strongly associated with improvements in reproductive and child health parameters. Analysis of the data on malnourishment of children reveals that the availability of some basic amenities at the household level makes a significant contribution to children's growth and prevention of malnutrition.

It argues that the survey's national wealth quintile classification does not account for interstate variations in wealth possession as well as rural-urban differences within states, which could lead to biased outcomes when applied to health indicators. It suggests that working out state-specific wealth quintiles that allow for the differentials would be more appropriate.

These agreements tend to push trade liberalisation much further than is possible under the multilateral trade regime. These RTAS also include rules which are likely to reduce the policy space for developing countries. This paper investigates whether signing of an RTA with a developed country necessarily leads to increased market access in that country. The findings suggest that this is not always so. But, on the other hand, developing countries face stricter intellectual property regimes, aggressive environment and labour clauses and extremely restrictive bilateral investment treaties, which impose some obvious and serious costs on the industrialisation process of developing countries. It concludes that the gains from north- south RTAS are doubtful while there will be some obvious costs.

Based mainly on secondary data, the analysis here suggests that the relatively high prevalence of domestic service and the tradition of inducting girl children into it have led to this trend. A complex interaction of historical, cultural and social practices, together with economic factors, determine women's work in general and that of girl children in particular. A significant factor in this context is the increasing urban affluence in the state led by the growth of the service sector in the recent years.

This paper examines Polanyi's arguments about the "Great Transformation" from traditional to market society in the light of recent advances in economic theory and empirical evidence from a range of European and non-European societies. These theoretical and empirical considerations provide little support for Polanyi's views concerning fundamental discontinuities between traditional and market societies. The paper concludes that Polanyi's rosy view of pre-market society provides an inappropriate historical basis for addressing the challenges faced by present-day transitional and developing economies.

Yet, the market for solar energy remains small and uneconomic, confined as the system is to households in remote villages and delinked from the network of electricity grids. If provided a direct link to the electricity grids which are served by thermal power systems, solar power systems can achieve economies of scale and can ultimately provide for the larger market of demand for electricity in the country.

This brief note shows that women at large remain significantly deprived of banking services. By any criterion – number of accounts, amount of loans, credit in agriculture, banking across socio-economic groups, and rural and urban areas – women remain far more disadvantaged than men. In recent times, there has, in fact, been a worsening of access to banking services for women from rural areas and those from economically backward regions and social groups.

The six points of contestation by Mihir Shah – including those on the public distribution system and the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme – are refuted. The argument in essence is that seeing the problems with anti-poverty programmes as faulty design and limited availability of resources does not recognise the culture of immunity in public administration and the weak capabilities of local governments.

Typically flood control and riverine studies focus on hydrological information, whereas a much more integrated approach that pays attention to specific morphological factors is required. Since Kosi is a dynamic river with a unique morphology and because it is a river which has always carried high sediment loads, flood management strategies must be attuned to such specific parameters of the river, besides being much more than mere "river control" through embankments.

The distribution of international aid is an important case in point. This essay reasserts the importance of certain old-fashioned questions relating to international aid: what is the quantum of aid available in relation to the need for it? How may patterns of allocation, at both the dispensing and receiving ends of aid, be determined so as to take account of both poverty and inter-national inequality in the distribution of incomes? Can some simple and plausible rules of allocation be devised? If so, what correspondence does reality bear to such rules? The questions are addressed with the aid of some simple analytics relating to optimal budgetary intervention in the alleviation of poverty. The ideas discussed are clarified by means of data employed in elementary empirical illustrations.

Mukherjee and Krishanu Karmakar||This paper studies the problem of poor health outcomes in India from the demand side, and using the unit level data from the 60th round of the National Sample Survey analyses the determinants of not accessing medical care. This analysis is confined to persons who have reported being ill within 15 days of the survey but have not sought either public or private professional medical services. There are systematic variations in accessing healthcare between urban and rural areas, as well as between males and females in each sector. While in the rural areas, the demand for healthcare increases significantly with the education level of the head of the household, in the urban areas the evidence is mixed. Richer economic sections constitute a larger proportion of sick persons who do not access medical care, especially in urban areas. Paradoxically, among poor households, which cite financial reasons for not accessing healthcare, women are less likely to be discriminated in rural than in urban areas.

Over- deterministic attribution of hegemonic powers to corporate capital takes away from the centrality of struggle and the contingent unpredictability of historical processes.

It is not exposure to subprime loans that is a problem; it is the loss on subprime related securities that explains the sheer magnitude of the present crisis. The evolution of the crisis shows that the world did not fully absorb all the lessons from the collapse of the hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.

The centre may have won this battle, but it has lost the war and if it was not apparent before it should be obvious now that the people of Kashmir no longer have faith in the constitutional processes. The allocation of land for the Amarnath yatra Controversy that triggered an explosion first in Kashmir and then led to agitations in the Jammu division, and the State's differential response to the demonstrations in these two parts of Jammu and Kashmir have signalled a message to the people in the Valley that they cannot expect justice and dignity from an increasingly communalised State apparatus.

Vidyasagar||This is a study of social mobility over 25 years in six villages in the former Tiruchirapalli district in Tamil Nadu. The two most important external drivers are local industrialisation and social policy in a broad sense. It is shown thatthe overall effect seems to be a centripetal tendency in agrarian structure, with a movement towards a strengthened position for family farming and for the underdogs in the old agrarian society to leave agriculture altogether, seeking improved life chances in the non-agrarian economy, both inside the villages and in the wider economy.

India should propose short-term crisis response actions and suggest a clear medium-term agenda. On the former, India needs to support globally coordinated actions to help limit the economic downturn, including a political commitment by all countries to keep marketsopen. The medium-term agenda would have, first, reforming the financial architecture, including by strengthening the International Monetary Fund's capacity to respond to crises and enhancing its legitimaey through radical governance reform to give greater say to the emerging powers. Second, securing openness of the trading system, which would require going beyond completing the current Doha agenda in two ways: deepening rules in existing areas (especially Services) and developing rules in new areas (to deal with undervalued exchange rates, cartelisation of oil markets, investment restrictions and environmental protectionism). Third, reforming governance of the meta-process for global decision-making, including through the creation of a more representative membership than the G-7.

It emphasises three aspects about the "Yasukuni Problem" and contemporary nationalism that are absent in much of the discussion in Japan, the Asia-Pacific and internationally. The first is the need to transcend an exclusively Japanese perspective by locating the issues within the framework of the Japan-US relationship. The second locates war nationalism in general, and Yasukuni in particular, within the broader purview of competing nationalism in the Asia-Pacific The third recognises deep fissures among the Japanese people with respect to Yasukuni, nationalism and the emperor in whose name Japan fought, and memories of colonialism and war.

A quartet of encounters with the law, in Mumbai and in Delhi, provides a context to exploring the relationship between poverty and criminality, and the extensive loss of rights that emerge asaconsequence. Beggary laws have begun to demonstrate how the law may be made, continued, expanded and practised when the constituency affected by the laws are powerless - so rendered by the illegality that the law visits on them, the prejudice that poverty provokes, the distance between privilege and poverty, and the vanishing obligations of the State. The Bombay (Prevention of Begging) Act 1959, in particular, has led to the callous treatment ofthose who are "ostensibly poor" and in the denial of rights to them, thereby rendering itself unconstitutional. It is therefore necessary to repeal the law.

This difference disappears once their lower Grade Point Averages are taken into account, suggesting that the large wage difference is due to the weaker (on average) academic Performance of SC/ST candidates. The study suggests that in the absence of any serious attempt to equalise school-level opportunities, the current policy of reservations at elite educational institutions will be insufficient to equalise career outcomes even for the minority of SC/ST candidates who can benefit from them.

The main conceptual problems are that the criteria are static and uniform across the entire country. Using primary data (collected in 2002) from 400 randomly selected households from eight villages of Rajasthan, the exercise here calculates the proportion of "wrongly exduded" (i e, who qualify according to government criteria but did not get a BPLcard) and "wrongly induded" households. Of the one-third of sample households that were classif ied as BPL, nearly a quarter have been wrongly induded. Besides, 44 per cent of the households which should have been counted as BPL were wrongly exduded. However, one must consider the appropriateness of the selection criteria along with these large selection errors.

They accounted for about 40 per cent of India's population. Twenty-five years earlier, 60 percent of India's population lived below the same real line. While this is clear progress, India's long-term pace of poverty reduction by this measure is no more than average for the developing world, excluding China. This article first discusses the methodology underlying the World Bank's recent revised estimates of global poverty and then analyses the Indian numbers.
Vol. 43, No. 43 (Oct. 25 - 31, 2008)||world bank's new poverty estimates||What Are These New Poverty Estimates and What Do They Imply?||Himanshu||The World Bank's recent estimates of poverty in the developing world have led to an upward revision of the number of poor in the world by 400 million. These adjustments are made on the basis of the revision in purchasing power parity estimates as part of the International Comparison Program exercise. Using the same ICP exercise, the Asian Development Bank claims an even higher estimate of the poor in Asia. A proper examination of the underlying database and the methodology for estimating poverty across countries suggests that though these estimates are better than the earlier ones, the assumptions behind the adjustments and the quality of data obtained from the ICP limit the usefulness of such an exercise for cross-country poverty comparisons. For India, both these estimates suggest severe underestimation in the official ntimbers on poverty.

Reddy||The "updated" estimates of global poverty by the World Bank do not address the basic problem with the past and current estimates, which is the lack of a clear criterion for identifying the poor. There is no basis to conclude that the new set of purchasing power parity rates employed to generate the new poverty estimates are closer to the "truth". We can only conclude that they are differently distorted than the earlier ones. There is, however, a feasible alternative method that would place at its core an identification criterion for the poor based on elementary human capabilities. The careful coordination of household surveys and poverty line construction across countries so as to capture whether individuals have the resources necessary to achieve these capabilities can ensure enduring comparability of poverty estimates over time and space.

Data reveal that for women, education and employment move in opposite directions, literacy among women workers is lower than literacy among non-working women and development is not closing the gender gap. The bulk of women "included" in development disproportionately constitute the unorganised workers; the latter are those in the unorganised sector plus those working in the formal sector as informal workers. Given such a macro context, the paper is sceptical of the feminist agenda of engendering development.

Suryanarayana||Inclusive growth is the new mantra of national and international agencies, but what does it mean and how does one measure inclusion or the lack of it? In contrast to policy documents that discuss inclusive growth in loose terms, this paper makes an attempt to define the concept and aims to develop measures of inclusion. Given the methodological inadequacies of verifying a broad-based growth process in terms of mean- based averages of income and absolute- norm based measures of deprivation, the study proposes order- based averages for verifying the presence of broad- based growth and extent of inclusion of the poor in terms of the consumer expenditure distribution. In addition, to facilitate verification and comparison of both inter- and intra- group inclusion in a plural society, normalised measures with reference to both mainstream/overall and subgroup averages are worked out. The tentative estimates indicate that the growth process between 1993-94 and 2004-05 bypassed the majority and was not inclusive. At the national level, the inclusion coefficient is higher for the rural sector than for the urban. The association between median consumption and the inclusion coefficient across states is weak, which would also imply that there is no cross- sectional evidence to believe that growth in India has been inclusive.

The immediate challenge is to arrest the loss of confidence of private investment and the attendant tightening of liquidity. The only way this can be achieved is by sustaining growth - through a major expansion of public investment in infrastructure and social programmes, financed by a monetised budget deficit. Such a deficit will infuse liquidity and well-chosen public outlays will revive growth. Inflation is a risk in such a strategy, but it is now a question of playing at the margin - the risk we are willing to take on inflation in order to raise domestic expenditure that would lead to faster growth.

Hirashima||This paper aims to shed light on the hitherto neglected issue of land in development. It examines the process of land market development in the former Punjab from when private ownership of land was established in mid-19th century, up to the present. It is found that as against the assumption of the classical rent theory, the price of land has been increasing much faster than rent. The differential growth rate between rent and the price of land is attributable, among other things, to the unregulated land market and excess liquidity at the micro level. The rapidly increasing capital gains in land transactions is a land bubble. It has to be realised that the bubble in India and Pakistan is difficult to burst, since it is mostly financed from outside the financial market. If the land bubble is left unattended to, the disparity between receivers and payers of rent will widen and it will retard private as well as the public investment necessary for development in the near future.

Examining the meanings of their community based teaching roles, the paper illustrates that women interpreted their engagements as community caretaking, which was grounded in interpersonal relationships and a desire for social upliftment of the disadvantaged. Illuminating civic participation from the standpoint of disadvantaged women, it reveals women's citizenship action as a complex and negotiated process, intersected by class and gender constructs.

But whether this means improved availability of market information or better understanding of complex instruments, in neither case will greater transparency reduce systemic risk in financial markets. Indeed, in some cases greater transparency could make things worse. Regulators must now abandon their belief in the tired trinity of greater transparency, more disclosure and better risk management by firms. Instead they must turn to finding ways to develop a systemic approach to regulation, including pro-cyclical provisioning and system-wide stress testing, and confront the vicious market cycle of rising asset prices accompanied by higher leverage, and the even more vicious cycle running in reverse.

One of the less researched areas has been the various taxes these organisations have to bear. This paper analyses the different levies on the operation of buses in a city and also attempts to compare these in different states in the country. It also compares the taxes levied on other modes of transport. The impact of these taxes on the total operating costs is brought out. It is concluded that the high rate of various taxes are one of the important reasons for the financial unviabiiity of public transport systems in India. Besides, as compared to other modes of transport, the levies on the public transport system are quite inequitable. The paper concludes by highlighting that the taxation regime for vehicles needs a total overhaul.

Judge and Gurpreet Bal||A study of dalits in two districts of Punjab reveals that ghettoisation remains common (including in urban areas). While the traditional caste occupational structure has changed, this is less so among dalits in rural areas. Caste endogamy remains the norm. The study shows that casteism is powerfully embedded in the collective consciousness. The caste system is oppressive due to discrimination, exclusion, exploitation and untouchability, but at the same time it situates the dalits in the system as a collective identity. Their desire is to end all kinds of discrimination, oppression and exclusion, but not the caste system in its entirety. This is an instance of a deep-rooted intemalisation of a world view. This paper is based on interviews of 1,600 dalit respondents randomly selected in Amritsar and Jalandhar districts of Punjab.

For this purpose, a representative sample survey of around 8,000 households and about 2,000 non-domestic consumers was carried out. The survey results bring out the deficiencies in services, and the significant coping costs the consumers are bearing. The survey data reveals that the consumers are willing to pay - and can afford - the extra cost that service improvement will entail. The analysis of survey data indicates that, for poor households in informal settlements, substantial improvement in water supply can be made by introducing/implementing paid group connections. Significant social gains, which could be as high as Rs 5,500 to Rs 8,000 million per annum, are expected from the efficiency improvements in the present system and other reforms that could be undertaken by the Delhi Jal Board.

The process of the law has been wilfully shredded and yet a case is made for broader powers of detention and investigation for the police. As contradictions in the official narrative on terrorism and its protagonists become manifest, public confidence will inevitably be eroded. And if a united and well-informed people are the only guarantee of public security, then the heavy-handed approach in evidence today seems designed to open the door towards greater terror.

Contrary to popular perception, primary food articles – cereals and pulses – have not had much to do with rising prices.

Each country will need to experiment and find the configuration of institutions and conventions that will work best within its national conditions and that will meet the expectations of its population. All such efforts require significant long-term investments (including by the public sector) in physical, human and social capital which can only be achieved through much more active policy interventions.

In a parliamentary democracy, the obligations of constitutional morality are expected to be equally binding on the government and the opposition. In India, the same political party treats these obligations very differently when it is in office and when it is out of it. This has contributed greatly to the popular perception of our political system as being amoral.

Dubash||Independent regulatory agencies have become an important part of the governance landscape in India and elsewhere. Some regulators have achieved useful outcomes. However, the creation of independent sectoral regulators in India has not been accompanied by critical reflection on their role, or attention to the political, legal, and institutional contexts within which they operate. This study explores various theoretical perspectives on the political economy of regulation, and elaborates on the implications these have for electricity and water regulation in India. The paper focuses on three themes: why governments create independent regulators, the meaning of "regulatory governance" and how it can be improved, and how regulators can address concerns such as social issues embedded in economic decision-making.

Though Gandhi still commands veneration from many, he is also someone everyone loves to hate. Some critics fault him for particular positions, such as his support of the Khilafat movement, his inexplicable views on the Bihar earthquake, his deployment of Hindu imagery or idioms of speech such as 'Ram Rajya', and so on. Other critics, arguing from specific ideological positions, are inclined to find systemic shortcomings in Gandhi's views. This paper, focusing in the latter half to a greater extent on modernist and especially feminist readings of Gandhi, suggests that the feminist reading is fraught with more ambivalence than is commonly recognised, and in somewhat unexpected ways. It is argued that though Gandhi may not have been his own best critic, his critics have also not done him the justice of attempting to understand how he negotiated the various critical worldviews that he encountered.

With the approach's engagements with Sovereignty revealing contingent and relativist features as well as sounder ontological foundations of the concept, constructivism is better placed to theorise issues related to domestic and regional politics in south Asia.

A significant body of research has argued that the "reformed" Hindu Code was not only very far from offering equal rights to women, it in fact took away many existing, more liberal customary provisions available to women of different communities and castes. Guha also offers a stereotypical division of the social sciences into History, Sociology, Political Science, etc. A number of scholars – the feminists being the first – have breached the disciplinary boundaries in the social sciences that were established in the 19th century.

This phantom discourse does not merely disarticulate the real relations between neoliberal globalisation and the material realities it enters, transforms, or destroys. It also offers a mode of affiliation for its chief beneficiaries who are required to feel global in conditions that are a far cry from what that term supposedly denotes. What are some of the cultural factors that facilitate such a discourse being credible? What can we learn from some of the terms that have come into prominence in this context? The article is also concerned with the contradictions and tensions that mark the contemporary moment. It argues that hyperbole is not merely a feature of present discourse but also a Symptom of what ails it.

Beena||The corporate sector in India has witnessed a substantial growth of mergers and acquisitions since the 1990s. Through the first wave of M&As (1990-95), the Indian corporate houses seem to have been bracing up to face foreign competition, while the second wave (since 1995) saw a significant involvement of multinational firms. The macroeconomic policy changes in India facilitated the third wave of merger movement since 2000–i e, overseas acquisitions by the Indian firms. A large number of mergers were between firms belonging to the same business groups and product lines with a view to increase their respective Controlling blocks and market power. The Performance of acquiring firms in 1990-2005 was relatively better as compared to that of the Indian private corporate manufacturing sector. However, this study does not find significant evidence of improvement in their Performance in terms of various parameters during the post-merger phase as compared to the pre-merger period. The study argues that it is not efficiency-related factors that influenced M&A activities in the Indian corporate sector. An appropriate competition policy needs to be designed so as to address the possible anti-trust implications of overseas mergers for India, as well as to deal with M&As among Indian enterprises.

This paper shows that the contribution of MNCS in the form of exports and royalties is significantly Iower than that of local firms. Insufficient attention to local subsidiary interests may undermine the motivation of subsidiary managers to discover new sources of advantage for the MNCS. It may also discourage subsidiary country govemments from offering incentives to MNCS for inward foreign direct investment.

It is observed that the traditional positive concentration-markup relationship does not hold in a dynamic context, when controlled for various structural aspects of the market, firms' strategies and policies of the government. In other words, industries with greater market concentration do not necessarily enjoy higher PCM in the long run, possibly due to entry of new firms, x-inefficiency of the incumbents and deceleration in industrial production.

Based on two compelling, though not fully comparable, case studies of Hyderabad and Mumbai, this article argues that both the union and State govemments are adopting city-centric growth strategies, following international trends, and that these have far-reaching social and spatial implications in terms of governance. The policy shift calls for a serious re-examination of intergovemmental responsibilities, functions and financial transfers in order to ensure that the larger social issues are included in city Strategie planning. In both cities, the ongoing processes are contentious and contradictory, providing a stark contrast to the smooth Vision Statements that convey an image of the quest for "development" as a consensual process.

There are forces in inter-governmental relations pulling in opposite directions, some tending to centralise functions of second tier governments, such as of the states in India, and others moving to decentralise to tiers further down, citing "subsidiarity". Although, globalisation at one level has given some functional autonomy for efficiency gain and competition and to attract private capital, it has restricted the scope for independent sub-state level fiscal policy. The biggest challenge for federalism in the coming years would be to respect the plurality of identity of human beings.

Ravishankar, Farah Zahir and Neha Kaul||More than half of the 14 major states achieved significant fiscal correction during 2000-06, with Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Orissa and Haryana in the lead. However, some high and middle income states lag behind, continuing to accumulate unsustainably high levels of debt and guarantees. The majority of states have relied more on enhancing their own revenues than on contracting expenditures, which is welcome in the context of the squeeze on infrastructure and social service expenditures that states had experienced over the 1990s. Those that have committed to fiscal responsibility and have achieved significant correction now face the challenge of translating outlays to outcomes. Those that lag behind must first address the challenge of fiscal discipline, learning from the success of others. It woy Id be advisable to target the end-of-year stock of outstanding debt and guarantees, in addition to current account balance ("golden rule"). Monitoring of end-of-year stock rather than annual flows would enhance year-to-year flexibility in states' fiscal management, while remaining within an agreed correction path.

The first should be that the economic cycle must be put close to the centre of banking regulation, since this is the source of market and systemic failure. The second should be a focus on systemically important distinctions, such as maturity mismatches and leverage.

It argues that the Congress knowingly and wilfully included and empowered Hindu nationalist ideologues in this period, most notably K M Munshi. Through such membership, the Hindutva agenda was advanced, while the ideology as a whole was rehabilitated and made an acceptable and normative feature of post-colonial Indian political life.

While the f irst aspect focuses on retardation in the physical growth of children as reflected in their weights vis-à-vis age, the second aspect highlights the inadequacy of children's calorie-intake. The analysis is based on a framework that is typically used in measuring income poverty but is rarely used in the measurement of physical underdevelopmentof children.

A field visit reports on the misery of the affected, haphazard rescue efforts and criminal exploitation of the uprooted. The immediate task is to improve relief operations and then provide support to the displaced who will not be able to find work until the 2009 kharif season. A blame game is now in operation, but since the early 1960s whichever the party in power, the people of Bihar have been affected by official apathy towards the embankments on the Kosi. This time it is a clear case of dereliction of duty by the state government in repairing upstream barrages before the monsoon of 2008 that has resulted in devastation.

A study undertaken of chemists and providers points to some of the challenges such as limited awareness of the appropriate regimen, protocol and likely side effects, the cost to clients, resistance of providers of surgical abortion and the need for adequate backup facilities. All these have to be addressed in order to make medical abortion available widely.

Jena||The Thirteenth Finance Commission faces a challenging task. Despite an improvement in recent years, the fiscal situation continues to be a matter of concern when off-budget liabilities and other fiscal risks are considered. With rising oil prices on the one hand and a surge in capital flows on the other, calibrating the transfer system in tune with counter-cyclical fiscal policy stance is a formidable challenge. This paper argues that irrespective of the wording of the terms of reference, the Commission would do well to focus on its primary task of recommending transfers to serve the objective of equity and incentives. While it is required to take into account a number of considerations, the focus should be on the transfer system. As an impartial body, the Commission should make a fair assessment of the central as well as state governments, ignoring the asymmetries in the wording of the TOR. As regards the transfer system itself is concerned, the paper argues that although it may be difficult to make drastic changes in the relative shares of the states, the Commission should give up the gap filling approach. Instead, after recommending tax devolution, the Commission should recommend grants to fully equalise expenditures on elementary education and basic healthcare. It is also possible to incenti vise the transfer system for even those states that have a better record of providing education and healthcare to improve the quality of these services.

Irfan Habib||Early Muslim civilisation was open to critical thinking, reason and consequently accepted eclecticism that included scientific observation and theory. In contrast the Islamic fundamentalists have rejected this eclecticism and have favoured a closed and inward looking world view that restricts itself to a literalist reading and understanding of the Quran. A trend has taken shape to "Islamicise" science, which sees modern science antithetical to Islam and has deteriorated into obscurantism. This has only resulted in the vandalisation of the core edifices of Islam, which exhort its believers to constantly seek knowledge.

Srinivasa Rao||India's more than one billion population comprises a unique mosaic of more than 400-odd languages and 3,000-odd dialects spread across its 28 states and seven union territories, making it a very distinct linguistic, cultural and ethnic landscape. However, this linguistic and cultural diversity has come under attack in different periods of history and has threatened the existence of many of the minority languages, mainly those which are numerically less represented and also those which are powerless or are of less utility in terms of social mobility. The paper discusses different contexts, starting from the colonial period to the recent National Knowledge Commission Report (2006) that tended to undermine the languages of less power in Indian education.

This is a standard conservative tactic of shifting the blame. Fannie and Freddie were caught in the negative externality of the housing bubble created by Wall Street. The true moral of the Fannie and Freddie story is that there is a case for nationalisation and greater regulation of financial markets.

Vol. 43, No. 35 (Aug. 30 - Sep. 5, 2008)||perspectives||Globalisation's Underbelly: Capital Flows and Indian Economy||Errol D'Souza||Recent capital flows to India have been predominantly portfolio flows and they have been associated with a deteriorating current account position. To induce foreign savings to finance current account deficits requires the interest rate in India to rise. When capital flows are associated with rising investment expenditure, economic growth is viewed as sustainable and foreign capital's willingness to share in the upside benefits through the acquisition of equity increases. To prevent the exchange rate appreciation associated with rising capital flows, the Reserve Bank of India has been accumulating foreign exchange reserves. This results in a rise in liquidity and a build-up of inflationary pressures. The RBI then resorts to sterilisation to mop up the excess liquidity in the financial system. This article discusses the implications of these processes for the financial system and the economy.

In this paper district level census data from archives are compiled to quantify the scale of migratory flows across the subcontinent. We estimate total migratory inflows of 14.5 million and outflows of 17.9 million, implying 3.4 million "missing" people. The paper also uncovers a substantial degree of regional variability. Flows were much larger along the western border, higher in cities and areas close to the border, and dependent heavily on the size of the "minority" religious group. The migratory flows also display a "relative replacement effect" with in-migrants moving to places that saw greater outmigration.

Ravindranath and O. P. Singh||The analysis presented in this paper shows that in water-scarce regions of India, run-off harvesting does not offer any potential for groundwater recharge or improving water supplies at the basin scale. The issues are many: (1) Water harvesting in the "closed" basins have downstream negative hydrological impacts. (2) Due to high inter-annual variability in rainfall and therefore run-off, during drought years the water harvesting structures have become highly unreliable, whereas an attempt to capture run-off during wet years would remarkably increase the unit cost of harvesting water. (3) In closed basins, intensive water harvesting would lead to negative welfare outcomes due to high negative externalities at higher degrees of basin development. (4) Even at the local level, physical efficiency of water harvesting is likely to be poor, mainly due to groundwater-surface water interactions and the poor storage capacity of hard rock aquifers underlying most of the water-scarce regions. The artificial recharge systems in natural water-scarce areas in India are economically unviable. Also, the much talked about virtues such as promoting equity in access to water, social justice, water security for the poor, and realisation of greater economic value from the use of water, can be hardly achieved through water harvesting programmes in water-scarce regions, as practised today.

While alienation in Kashmir seeks an outlet in secession, militancy or religious orthodoxy, in Jammu its traditional vents have been communalism or ultranationalism. Unless and until the aspirations of the three ethnically distinct regions of the State (Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh) are reconciled, there will always be pretexts for conflict.

It finds an increase in prices for commodities that have small market sizes and scarce deliverable supplies (mentha oil, wheat). In contrast, futures trading has led to a reduction in volatilities and aided better discovery for other commodities (soya oil, hessian). It appears that futures trade in agricultural commodities is beneficial for only those commodities that fulfil the basic selection criteria for futures trading accompanied by stringent and timely regulatory actions.

Must the emergence of the novel be seen as a radical break with the literary modes preceding it? Highlighting notions of both rupture and continuity, this paper attempts to trace the embeddedness of the Hindi novel in the multilingual Indo-Persianate literary culture that characterised north India, particularly the twin cities of Agra and Delhi, as well as the ruptures and radical changes in social and cultural sensibilities that it sought to both explore and anticipate. It focuses on Shrinivasdas' Pariksha Guru (The Tutelage of Thal, 1882), the first novel of note in Hindi, as it emerged from the merchant milieu of Delhi and its vicinity, juxtaposing it with Banarasidas Ardhakathanak (Half a Tale, 1641), an early modern merchant life-story set in Jaunpur and Agra. This draws attention to the recurring merchant milieu and the vulnerability of this Community in particular to the kinds of social changes entering its world.

The maratha- kunbis and dalits are the greatest beneficiaries of upward mobility though there is a difference in the mode of their journey. The Other Backward Classes lag behind these two and some castes among them even show Stagnation as far as mobility is concemed.

The central government Claims that it has been introduced to tax those kinds offringe benefits, which are collectively enjoyed by employees in the form of facilities/amenities and are difficult to identify, segregate, and apportion among beneficiaries for taxation. Accordingly, the tax liability has been fixed on employers, not on employees. The FBT collection data for the first two years have been analysed here to gain insight for further reforming and fine-tuning the FBT regime. FBT collections from various sectors of the economy have been examined and the significant heads of FBT identified. The banking, petrochemical and infotech sectors are the largest contributors, and employee welfare, conveyance and telephone connections are the largest contributing heads of FBT.

There is no evidence that this reverse sequencing works. The draft report also neglects the evidence on market failures, important among them being the pro-cyclicality of capital flows. It recommends using only the interest rate instrument for inflation targeting. This is likely to result in prohibitive interest rates. It also recommends that India follow a non-interventionist exchange rate policy instead of a managed float. This may have been a possibility if there was system-wide coherence in the international exchange rate system, but we know that is not the case.

While many of the recommendations have merit, the broad approach to reduce regulatory costs, overlaps, silos and gaps appears to be characterised by "melting the pot" to create a homogeneous financial system. This runs the risk of putting financial stability to strain, as also of enhancing institutional and market inefficiencies. The quest for creating more efficient and liquid markets needs to focus beyond melting the pot to addressing the core aspects of liquidity, efficiency and stability, while retaining heterogeneity.
Vol. 43, No. 32 (Aug. 9 - 15, 2008)||draft raghuram rajan committee report||Reforming the Banking Sector||T. T. Ram Mohan||The committee on financial sector reforms highlights several concerns on the Indian banking sector - about financial deepening, inadequate competition, lack of scale, high spreads banking, the low usage of new technologies, the decline in market share of public sector banks, etc. These concerns are either valid only up to a point or are misplaced when viewed against the totality of the Indian banking situation. Concern is also expressed about social obligations, delinking the government from banks and greater freedom to private banks - these too are not valid concerns. Indian banking is in a reasonably healthy state and is evolving in the right direction. It needs incremental, not sweeping, changes.

This paper reports the results of a survey of tradftional stove ownership and health among 2,400 households in rural Orissa. We find a very high incidence of respiratory illness. About one- third of the adults and half of the children in the survey had experienced symptoms of respiratory illness in the 30 days preceding the survey, with 10 per cent of adults and 20 per cent of children experiencing a serious cough. We find a high correlation between using a traditional stove and having symptoms of respiratory illness. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the high level of observed respiratory illness is due to other factors that also contribute to a household's decision to use a traditional stove, such as poverty, health preferences and the bargaining power of women in the household.

But in practice, such programmes use a host of other dynamic and static incentives features, engage in meticulous designing of financial products and use different models of service delivery, going beyond "group lending with joint liability" This paper attempts to take stock of these developments: the ongoing innovations in designing flexible and tailor- made financial products, the ingenuous use of a variety of incentive mechanisms, and the evolution and acceptance of microfinance from a focused credit intervention approach towards a broader paradigm of livelihood finance.

Navaneetham||This article utilises the National Family Health Survey-3 data and presents an empirical assessment of income-related health inequality in India. It undertakes a state-level analysis of inequities in child health by employing the widely accepted measures of concentration curves and concentration indices. It finds that the poorer sections of the population are beleaguered with ill health whether in the quest for child survival or due to anxieties pertaining to child nutrition. Further, an attempt is made to comprehend the relationship between income inequality and health status in the Indian context. The analysis reveals that the degree of health inequalities escalates when the rising average income levels of the population are accompanied by rising income inequalities. The income-poor sections have different needs and therefore, planning and intervention necessitates an understanding of the sources of inequality and recognition of the vulnerable groups to arrive at efficient resource allocation and policy decisions.

This paper traces the background of the famine and analyses the role of the land market in fuelling food price rise. It appears that in a monetised, already famished, agrarian economy, during situations of subsistence crisis, interlinking of food and land markets has the potential to cause an exponentially high degree of disaster. The role of a universal public distribution system, which carries over food from a surplus to a deficit year, and insulates the food market, thus becomes paramount.

Many of the methods of Kosambi's analyses are substantially valid even 50 years later. Some need reconsideration either because of new evidence or because of new theories of explanation or because the overall perspectives of the past are today differently nuanced. Kosambi's intellectual perspectives and sensibilities were inevitably of his own times. Up to a point they carry traces of both the idealism and the dismissals ofthose times. He insistently asserted his autonomy from the clutches of contemporary orthodoxies, both of the Left and of the Right. The past was not to be used as a mechanism of political mobilisation as it has increasingly come to be among some in our time. The sources that inform us about the past have to be meticulously analysed and subjected to a rigorous methodology irrespective of their Status or the authority they command. Kosambi would undoubtedly have agreed that the advance of knowledge was dependent on a constant critiquing of existing explanations.

His method was positivist but sophisticated in its positivism, and if recent work in the history of textuality (Indian and other) suggests that more attention to cultural difference is needed, his text-critical work remains foundational for further scholarship. His theory was positivist, too, in keeping with his Vision of scientific Marxism, and if its strong universalism here produced a skewed interpretation that is now in all its essentials dead, he introduced a new and crucial critical dimension to Sanskrit studies. Perhapsthe most remarkable (and most disturbing) realisation about Kosambi's quest for a political philology is that nearly 50 years after his death he has had not a Single successor in India.

A theoretical framework that was new to the study of Indian history supported his reconstruction of the religion of the Indus valley, as well as his explanations for the spectacular rise and fall of Buddhism, and the enduring appeal of the Krishna myths. From today's perspective his work betrays a few blind spots, but it remains largely relevant for the intellectual leap ittook in exploring the essential relation between faith and socio-economicfactors, and its consciously creative use of Marxism.

Does his archaeology measure up to his history? The approach in this paper is to view the internal logic of his hypotheses in archaeology, and to ask if Kosambi did justice to the data available in his time. Did he present a sound data analysis that could be emulated, enlarged, or reworked? The answer has to be "no". Kosambi's site locations were not precise; he was not interested in the typology of stone tools; and his correlations of tool occurrences with sacred Sites, of the tribe with an absence of plough agriculture, and of iron technology with agricultural surpluses, were flawed. Perhaps Kosambi's archaeology does not measure up to his history because for him archaeology was only an extension of history. But in order to work with the entities of archaeology, typology and classification are indispensable: as indispensable as is the knowledge of an ancient language for the historian. Failure to engage in the grammar of these entities and an ignorance of site formation processes give rise to faulty generalisation.

What set him apart from others who "applied" Marxism to Indian history was his determination to maintain, indeed increase the Standard of rigour in his factual and textual research, for Marxism dealt with a far more extensive area than the one over which research had conventionally been conducted. Guided by the basic thesis about how social evolution occurs, he rejected the view that India had ever passed through a phase of slavery; rather it was the construction of caste society that happened here. The reasons for his acceptance of a stage of feudalism spanning the period from that of the Guptas to the Mughals are most interesting.

This paper identifies the "Kosambi effect" and its various constituents. The most crucial constituent is the awareness that historical knowledge cannot be based on empirical givens and that a methodology guaranteeing a systematic, deductively formulated, and empirically verified concept of reality about the past is indispensable. The adaptation of historical materialism to serve the purpose, and accordingly writing a history worth designating a genre by itself in form, content and hermeneutics is another crucial constituent.

Kosambi's research in numismatics beginning in the 1940s marked a radical departure in the field from the practices and interests in the previous 100 years. There can be questions about how historians, including Kosambi, may have used coins as markers of sodo-economic change. But Kosambi's use of numismatics was such that historians can no longer ignore numismatic evidence for societal history. It was inevitable that some of the major findings of Kosambi would not stand the test of time. But the need to revisit his findings only demonstrates the value of his pioneering perspectives: we need to think differently and prepare a new agenda for examining material from the past — if necessary by turning current perspectives upside down.

Similarly, not all sons in the family receive equal treatment and those who are left bachelors suffer a lesser fate. This paper attempts to move beyond currently available explanations of low sex ratios and daughter elimination. While supporting the hypothesis that large peasant castes in the north and north-west practised infantieide, non-marriage of men and polyandry as strategies to control family numbers in relation to available resources, this paper makes three arguments: one, that these strategies occurred together, two,that one needs to go beyond this explanation to understand why daughters were the dispensable ones and, three, that the number of sons wanted was by no means unlimited.

At the poverty line, the minimum calorie requirements used for defining this line in the base year are not being met in later years. While the official poverty line used the food requirement norm from nutrition science, this paper employs the food consumption requirement derived from the Engel curve as the norm to arrive at a measure of food consumption deprivation. It is shown that food deprivation levels do not reflect the same pattern that the traditional poverty indices depict, questioning the usefulness of traditional poverty indices for measuring food deprivation.

Based on a field survey in the four states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Orissa, this paper studies the own revenue effort of rural local bodies within their statutorily defined revenue rights. The study finds that the assigned tax rights are not fully utilised by the panchayats and non-tax revenue is the dominant source of their own revenue. A comparison of own revenues of the panchayati raj institutions for 2005-06, based on the survey results with those reported by the Twelfth Finance Commission for 2002-03, shows a huge difference between the two sets in the case of per capita own tax in Madhya Pradesh and per capita own non-tax in Chhattisgarh.

This article examines the fiscal sustainability of Tamil Nadu by looking at four major deficit indicators, viz, the revenue deficit, the primary revenue balance, the primary deficit and the gross fiscal gap using the Gregory-Hansen Cointegration test. It contends that if revenues and expenditures are both difference stationary and cointegrated, the fiscal stance is sustainable. Alternatively, if revenues and expenditures are difference stationary but not cointegrated, then the fiscal position is deemed to be unsustainable. Evidence for Tamil Nadu using annual data for 1971-2006 finds that when considered in real terms with the exception of the gross fiscal gap, the other three deficit indicators – the revenue deficit, the primary deficit and the primary revenue balance – are not sustainable.

True, there has been rapid growth in Shanghai, but most of this growth has been to the benefit of corporations (public sector and foreign controlled), little has gone to the city's households. Since the late 1990s, the poor of Shanghai have in fact seen a relative decline in incomös vis-à-vis the richer groups. Shanghai has a strong government (which has put up thetowering Skyline), but entrepreneurship and private initiative are limited compared to that in most other provinces of China. The city's record in Innovation too has been poor. Is this the path for Mumbai to follow?

Unfortunately, much of this debate has failed to subject the judgment to rigorous legal analysis. This paper attempts to fill the gap by first proposing a general methodology for a legal reading of a court judgment. Itthen provides a careful analysis of the A KThakur judgment and shows that the ratio in the case is a narrow one with no radical departures from the Court's existing doctrine on reservation law and policy. The paper then assesses the Court's approach to the problems of identifying beneficiariesand suggests that the Court closely correlate the intrusivenessof affirmative action measures chosen and the moral justifications for the same. It concludes by addressing several policy proposals that aim to restructure affirmative action and suggest alternative frameworksof legal doctrine that will allow the Court to effectively respond to these demands for reform.

It looks atthe perpetuation of Naga nationalism in the framework of Laclau and Mouffe's discourse theory and Gramsci's concept of hegemony. Building upon earlier studies that have established the potential of the internet to promote nationalist ideologies, it brings to light how particular political ideologies are constructed and reinforced through the internet to address issues intrinsic to the Nagas who have historically lived independently with little interaction with non- Naga groups. The nationalist ideology placed in the context of discourse theory is methodologically approached through analysis of texts in political web sites dedicated to the Naga issue.

The opening offree trade in the region has led to countries in south Asia experiencing high trade costs due to inadequacy in trade and transport facilitation. South Asia's trade is constrained by poor infrastructure condition, congestion, high costs, and lengthy delays. These Problems are particularly severe at border crossings, many of which pose significant barriers to trade. This paper Supplements the findings of previous studies on this subject and reassesses the transaction costs for India's overland exports to Bangladesh. It finds that transaction costs of India'sexportsto Bangladesh have increased despite simplification of documentations at border. The paper concludes that the rent-seeking informal economy is very much deep-rooted and making the trade transaction expensive at border.

Ram Mohan||What are the benefits and costs to India of an enlarged foreign bank presence? Going by the three important criteria of access to financial services, efficiency and provision of credit, it is unlikely that foreign banks can do more than what the Indian banking system can provide. Add to that the risks posed by larger operations by foreign banks and there is a case for revisiting the 2005 road map of the Reserve Bank of India which indicated that these banks may be able to expand their presence after 2009.

But these NGOS were merely instruments in the hands of their sponsors-multilateral organisations and private foundations. The NGOS were essential to the sponsors, who used them as tools to change local practice, orienting it towards more privatisation, democracy and individual rights. But when times changed, the NGOS found themselves adrift. Caught between an authoritarian government (that kept them under surveillance) and foreign sponsors, local organisations found little freedom of movement. They had no social base to fall back on, no civil society that could be mobilised in their defence.

A survey documenting the change of land use that has taken place on the sites of demolished slum clusters highlights the emerging processes and trends. Some of its findings question the stated principle of the Delhi slum policy, namely, the removal and relocation of squatter settlements only when the land is required to implement projects in the " larger public interest". The preparation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games further provides the urban authorities with an opportune context to " clean up" the city from its slums.

The legal regime adopted to solve the issue should place the poor and human rights in the centre stage of a new entitlement- based strategy to address the issue. This framework would then involve the development of technology reducing greenhouse emissions in the richer countries and the transfer of the same to the poorer ones.

The arguments are illustrated with reference to the public rail and air services and help to understand why some public sector transport undertakings have performed better than others. The most effective changes are those that create incentives, broadly defined, for individuals to improve productivity.

Lessons for Social Mobility and Poverty Reduction||Anirudh Krishna and Eric Haglund||Not everyone in our country has equal access to competitive sports. Many are not effective participants on account of ignorance or disinterest, disability or deterrence. This analysis considers two separate arenas for enlarging the pool of effective participants, one related to sports and other to social mobility. In both cases, this paper finds the plausibility of an explanation based on effective participation rates. It examines what country characteristics are associated with greater success in the Olympics at the macro level by considering indicators such as health, education, and especially three variables of information and access (road length per unit of land area, the share of urban population and radios per capita). It also analyses the opportunities and achievements in the villages of two states, Karnataka and Rajasthan.

Sekhar||This paper attempts to analyse the current global crisis in the availability and prices of rice by drawing upon the long-term developments in the rice market. The instability and thinness in the world rice markets are shown to be mainly due to the predominantly precautionary export policies of major exporting countries, which in turn are a result of domestic food security considerations. Some possible policy options are also discussed.

If the KGBV is to be given a second chance for mainstreaming rural girls belonging to deprived social backgrounds, it needs to set right certain shortcomings.

Vol. 43, No. 26/27 (Jun. 28 - Jul. 11, 2008)||perspectives||The Accumulation Process in the Period of Globalisation||Prabhat Patnaik||The inflation in food prices of the early 1970s that arose out of excess demand for cereals disappeared in later years not because of any significant supply augmentation, but because it was substituted by an income deflation on the working people, including the peasantry, over large tracts of the world. This income deflation, brought about by the imposition of neoliberal policies, compressed demand and kept food and other commodity prices in check. But over the longer term, income deflation has undermined the very viability of peasant agriculture, adversely affecting supply. All this is part of the process of "accumulation through encroachment" which had been a central feature of colonialism and has re-emerged with a vengeance in the era of globalisation.
Vol. 43, No. 26/27 (Jun. 28 - Jul. 11, 2008)||review of agriculture||The Global Food Crisis: Causes, Severity and Outlook||Ramesh Chand||This paper discusses the various factors that have been identified as responsible for the current global crisis in the availability of food and for the rise in prices of cereals. It argues that the crisis is different from the ones in the 1960s and 1970s in that there is now likely to be a permanent upward shift in real prices. It is important that developing countries place renewed emphasis on self-sufficiency to ensure food security, since they are unlikely to be able to afford expensive food imports.

Raghavan||This paper estimates and compares the paid-out cost of cultivation of wheat in India, the most state-protected crop, during the input subsidy regime of the 1970s and 1980s and after its abolition in the 1990s, when economic reforms were initiated. The study uses the valuable time series information collected as part of the "comprehensive scheme" of the ministry of agriculture. After surveying the pattern of changes in inputs as well as costs of cultivation vis-à-vis the wholesale price index (a proxy for the general price level), the value of inputs which are exclusively market-purchased are analysed. A study of the weighted average of these costs establishes unequivocally that the costs of farm inputs increased very sharply in the post-reform period.

The important policy recommendations that emerge are the need to improve the institutional agricultural credit system, to regularise and continuously monitor the functioning of non-institutional sources of finance, to reduce farmers' fixed costs in heavy machinery and equipment for which loans should also be based strictly on economic feasibility, to strengthen the dairy sector and create off-farm employment opportunities and to launch a mass campaign against intoxicants and extravagant expenditure on social festivities.

Does the sequencing of reform and an agriculture-led package matter? What could other developing countries and countries in economic transition learn from the experiences of India and China? What could these two countries learn from their own as well as each other's experiences? How can the two largest developing countries cooperate in their agricultural and economic development and work together at multilateral negotiations, such as those conducted through the World Trade Organisation, to address the concerns of developing countries? This paper summarises the key findings of a number of studies that were prepared fortwo international conferences devoted to comparing the rural development and agricultural reform experiences of China (the dragon) and India (the elephant) over the last several decades.

The countries with a strong research system like India and China have initiated a number of reforms with an objective to diversify the sources of funding and increase research efficiency. Competitive funding, commercialisation of technologies, strengthened intellectual property rights, facilitating regulations and flexible extension approach are some of the major reforms undertaken. This paper examines the outcomes of these reforms and draws lessons for other developing countries.

The essay identifies the obstacles to the writing of contemporary history, and also outlines how they might be overcome. It suggests some important themes for research–among them, the histories of states, the histories of institutions, and the biographies of writers and activists. Finally, it suggests that since the study of colonialism is meeting with diminishing returns, contemporary history might and perhaps should become a "growth area" for the future.

Ramana||India and Pakistan have been talking peace since 2003, yet they have continued to expand their nuclear arsenals. This suggests a failure both of imagination and of political will to seriously engage with the nuclear danger. The peace process does not seem to recognise the fact that since the two countries conducted their nuclear tests in 1998 there has been a war and a major military crisis, both prominently featuring nuclear threats. Nuclear denial in south Asia is not a symptom of inattention, or passivity in the face of an overwhelming problem. It is deliberate blindness to the contradiction between word and deed. India and Pakistan talk of peace while pouring scarce resources into developing their nuclear arsenals, the infrastructure for producing and using them, and doctrines aimed at fighting a nuclear war.

After analysing the recent trends in government health spending by the centre and states, this paper notes that sound fiscal targets for health spending should be based on goals for outcomes and the resources needed to achieve them, which are largely lacking. It suggests that large and sustainable increases in government health spending will require more focus on the states' own spending as well as improving the capacities of states and districts to use resources for health effectively.

This article first discusses the official wholesale and consumer price indices and the impact of not regularly incorporating new products and changes in quality, and related deficiencies. It also draws on an official United States commission report that studied the implications of productivity changes for measuring inflation. The paper concludes with suggestions for revising the procedures for collecting and compiling price information and also recommends preparation of a new producer price index to replace the official Wholesale Price Index and, in addition to the consumer price indices, the compilation of an annual "cost of living index".

James||Demographic factors have reappeared in the economic development debate with the emergence of the concept of the "demographic dividend". With many developing countries experiencing a rapid decline in fertility, there has been overwhelming optimism that a demographiobonus will take these countries to greater economic heights. At the same time, there are pessimists doubting the ability of these countries to take advantage of the demographic dividend. This paper looks at the concept critically in the context of India. It tries to empirically estimate the contribution of the age structure change to economic growth in the country through a two-stage least Square method. The empirical analysis clearly exhibits a powerful positive impact of the boom in the working age group population on economic growth. This is despite the fact that the educational achievements and health conditions of the people are far from desirable and employment creation is well belowthe required level.

Desiraju||Many aspects of the Indian scientific development are extremely unsatisfactory, lacking in both quality and quantity. Although the outreach of teaching and research programmes has increased considerably, populist political themes are favoured and special institutions have been created where research is undertaken independent of the university system. This article reviews the present scene in science education, and identifies the major problems and the challenges confronting the institutions involved in education and research. It suggests that the government should restrict itself to broad policy issues rather than be involved in day-to-day affairs and the university should be re-established as the primary agency for education and research.

This essay seeks to contrast the approach and the emphasis of the two books, both of which were written under the influence of nationalism. The authors used and read the existing archives very differently and tried to come to terms with the idea that the uprising was a war of independence.

This article identifies commonalities such as the significant macroeconomic role of migration and similar main destinations for south Asia's mobile populations. It critiques popular themes in the discourse on migration, like the focus on economic benefits of moving populations and the nation state as a reference point. The article questions the existing views of what it means for people to move from their homes, many times (but not only) across international borders.

Two tests have been used to measure these deviations. The first is the statistical measure of risk premium defined as interest differentials between two countries (here India and the us) adjusted for expected depreciation of the exchange rate. A positive value of such a measure essentially means that higher interest rate differentials reflect a systematic risk, exchange rate risk being a part of it. The other is regression analysis using monthly data. The mean of the average of risk premium is found to be positive and statistically significant for government bonds across all maturities. However, in the regression analysis, there is evidence of risk premium only for government bonds with a 10-year maturity period. Overall, the results confirm the presence of a systematic risk associated with investments in India compared to those in the us.

Liberals also regard the masses as disinterested and "innocent"; it is claimed that radical parties such as the Nepali Maoists impose their will on the masses. Inevitably this conception of "innocent" masses and non-comprehension of radical mobilisation explain the surprise at the Maoist victory in Nepal. At the same time, does the participation of the Maoists in the liberal polity create the conditions for mass passivity and hence co-option within the same liberal framework?

On the contrary, an ethnographic investigation in a village panchayat reveals that divisions between the elite and the subaltern continue to exist in a complex form despite grassroots democracy in the state.

Srivastava||Two central problems in a fiscal transfer system relate to resolving vertical and horizontal imbalances. This paper looks at the methodological background of fiscal transfers followed by recent finance commissions, particularly the Twelfth Finance Commission. It is noted that in India, there is long- term stability in the share of states after transfers in the combined centre and state revenues. This stability depends on linking the share of states in the transfers, particularly tax devolution, with the difference in the buoyancies of central and state taxes. In the context of horizontal imbalance, it is argued that some of the recent finance commissions have implicitly followed an axiomatic approach to tax devolution and brought in some normative elements in determining grants. In spite of large differences in fiscal capacities, a high degree of equalisation has been achieved. It is shown that for TFC recommended transfers, nearly 88 per cent of the needed equalisation was achieved while devoting 50 per cent of transfers to resolving vertical imbalance. A methodology is also developed to determine the weights of the vertical and equalising components of transfers through devolution.

It is more a consequence of the lack of an appropriate agency and politics among the working classes, despite their increasing incompatibilities with globalising capitalism. A set of case studies of manufacturing industries in Bangalore illustrates this point.

Can an independent organisation such as UNITES Pro (the union of information technology enabled services professionals) represent employees' interests and effectively work towards protecting their rights and improving their working conditions? A survey of UNITES members indicates that they identify with the need for such an organisation to deal with poor supervisory and managerial treatment, concerns for employee safety, grievances related to pay and workload, and even the indignities of favouritism.

Ghose||China's economy has recorded extraordinarily rapid growth for more than two decades. What have been the employment effects of this growth? And to what extent have these effects been conditioned by the institutional reforms? The paper focuses on the period 1990-2005. Rapid economic growth was indeed associated with a high-speed increase in productive employment. Surplus labour declined substantially; many workers moved from lower-productivity to higher-productivity jobs and labour-incomes increased in all types of employment. However, there have been some negative developments too. In particular, given that the formal sector had inherited substantial stocks of surplus labour from the past, economic restructuring and labour market reforms resulted in declining formal employment and growing urban unemployment for a period.

While minimum required working conditions are implemented, the criteria for social and environmental compliance are not met with. The multinational's decision to withdraw orders from the previous supplier ostensibly due to allegations of child labour and unauthorised subcontracting hit large sections of the workforce, especially rural, low-skilled and female workers. Is it fair for multinationals to cut and run in such cases or should they find a solution to save thousands of livelihoods?

Jose||A review of evidence on employment and wages from selected European Union countries leads one to surmise that in the context of developing . countries, we tend to judge the performance of labour regulatory regimes more in terms of their impact on employment creation. Inadvertently though, we seem to foist a false idiom, since a job-creating function is beyond the terms of reference of any protectionist labour regulation. What is important in developing countries is to facilitate a rapid, but endogenous evolution of labour institutions that can protect workers' rights and remain friendly to job-creation. This requires a fresh look at some national level policies and programmes, which are not necessarily in the domain of labour relations.

For this to happen, the authors provide a theory of labour that incorporates the varied labour practices and the manner in which wealth from these practices are appropriated, distributed and received, thereby widening the imagination of what is possible in trade union practice.

Sundaram||Analysing the unit record data from the National Sample Survey (55th and 61st rounds) on employment and unemployment, the organised sector workforce in non-agriculture is shown to be larger than the corresponding Directorate General of Employment and Training estimates by 16.5 million in 2004-05 and to have increased by 5.4 million between 2000 and 2005 instead of the 1.6 million decrease indicated by the corresponding DGE&T estimates. Examining some features of employment contracts of the regular wage/salary workers who account for 88 per cent of the organised sector workforce, it is shown that between 14 and 27 million of the 41.5 million workers in organised non-agriculture are perhaps better labelled as informal workers who are without access to a set of social security benefits, though they are located in the formal sector. An analysis of labour productivity in the organised-unorganised segments of broad industry groups for 1999-2000 and 2004-05 is followed by an examination of differences across the organised-unorganised divide in average daily earnings and in the poverty status of adult workers in non-agricultural activities for 2004-05.

These explanations problematically construe India's "paradigm shift" as the outcome of a non-ideological and "inevitable" process of intellectual evolution among policy "technocrats". The paper proposes an opposing view of the policy process, in which conflict is central, and thq deliberate exercise of power is crucial to why some policy alternatives are privileged and selected over others. It is suggested that far from being the one inescapable conclusion to the lengthy debates over economic strategy that were typical to India's economic history, the 1991 reforms arose out of the political defeat of many credible alternatives. These reforms represented the surprising eclipsing of not only an alternative economic paradigm, but also the reversal of almost 50 years of nationalist anxiety over India's position of disadvantage within an inequitable global order. In light of this, the "paradigm shift" is viewed as a political event that might have been eluded under different political circumstances, and not as an historically necessary phenomenon brought to light by an elite team of "experts".

Prudhvikar Reddy and Soumya Vinayan||Based on fieldwork, this paper examines the problems and prospects of the handloom sector in Andhra Pradesh. One major finding is that the growth performance of cooperatives determines the growth of other institutions - the master weavers, middle men and independent weavers. Well- performing cooperatives are the best safeguard for the handloom sector, as they protect the weaver and also provide a counterbalance to the master weaver. Competition from powerlooms is an obvious threat, but this can be countered if the sector produces high value, unique (brand value) products or medium value products which can be marketed locally or abroad, as distinct from powerloom products.

Based on an ethnographic fieldwork in a village in Allahabad district, this paper explores the aspirations of women and young girls to changes in marriage practices. It seeks to understand how patriarchy, customs and traditions operate in the form of social disciplines that constrain women's lives and how women perceive these social disciplines and attempt to carve out spaces of freedom. Most women and young girls however seek to access greater freedom in life through education and a move into urban areas while leaving the parental responsibility of arranging marriages intact.

Kavi Kumar||The poverty of an entity is manifest in her deprivation not only in income but also in other dimensions such as health, nutrition and sanitation. Hence, a comprehensive measure of poverty must ideally take into account the performance of an individual across multiple dimensions. Vulnerability to poverty captures the likelihood of an entity falling into poverty, given the current status of the household. Unlike poverty, which describes the status of an entity at a point of time, vulnerability is predictive in nature. This study ranks 15 major states in terms of multidimensional poverty and vulnerability to multidimensional poverty at two time points in the 1990s. The results show that both multidimensional poverty and vulnerability provide additional insights for prescriptive policies.

The question is how to create a System that best serves the long-term interests of the country's marginalised communities, as well as the nation State as a whole. If the massive machinery of India's welfare State suffers under the demands of its own reservations System, Nepal will have to think carefully about its own infrastructural limitations when crafting its version of affirmative action. One of the biggest challenges will be balancing the prerogatives of federalism with policies of reservation, which by definition require a strong central infrastructure to provide for equitable recognition and distribution of benefits.

Focusing on two of them, this article shows that the extent of the violence was markedly different, and asks "why?". Attention is drawn to the kind of ethnic mix in their workforces, to their different experiences of "modemity" shop floor cultures and histories of displacement, and to the different agendas of State govemments and the way they shaped civil society institutions.

It argues that India's growth has been largely enabled by the availability of domestic savings, which have increased steadily over the decades. Further, the efficiency of resource use has been high with a long-term incremental capital-output ratio of around 4, which is comparable to the best in the world. While private investment and corporate growth have been majorfactors in the recent growth upsurge, it is important to note that this period has also been marked by a relative decline in public investment. A revival of public investment, accompanied by higher public savings, would be necessary to improve and expand public Services.

Suryanarayana||The demand for "universalisation" of the public distribution system during a period of rising prices is not relevant since more than four-fifths of households in rural areas and two- thirds in urban centres are already covered by it. Yet, a very small proportion of rural/ urban households actually make purchases of either rice or wheat from the PDS; an insignificant amount of consumption is met by ration shop purchases. The pattern is somewhat better for below the poverty line households with ration cards. What all this shows is that the issue is not universalisation but improved functioning, greater efficiency and BPL-friendliness of the PDS.

As dialogue and persuasion remain the hallmark of effective surveillance, the credibility of the new decision hinges on its implementation in an even-handed manner between developed and developing countries and among countries that have floating exchange rates and managed exchange rates. Governance reform of the IMF with greater voice and participation of developing countries and emerging market economies becomes important in enhancing their shared commitment to effective implementation of the new decision.

But plural societies tend to be stamped by deep disagreements on the basic norms that should govern the polity. For this reason alone, these societies can prove deeply divided and fractious. How do defenders of dialogue establish the preconditions for dialogue among participants? How do agents who wish to put forth a particular point of view establish their credibility: that their reflection and their proposed courses of action are in the public interest, and not in the pursuit of some selfish private gain? How can communication among agents be enabled at all insofar as these agents can be persuaded to modify or moderate their original position in and through the process of dialogue? Perhaps the Gandhian philosophy of satyagraha provides us with some answers to these vexing questions.

This is an analysis of the compelling reasons for an objective and effective management of operational risk and a brief recall of the present methods for measuring and modelling it. Subsequently, through the results of a survey to take stock of the preparedness of Indian banks in managing such risk, the authors find that the Indian banking sector is still in its preparatory stage and is constrained in implementing a sound operational risk management system as it is wanting in risk transfer and its quantification.

It finds that locals are indifferent to the administrative jurisdiction of the forest in the course of their resource extraction activities. There is no quantitative evidence that they are exercising restraint while accessing and using locally governed forests. Collective rule violation appears to be common. The inhabitants are unaware about the long-term ecological implications of their actions. As a consequence, both van panchayat forests as well as the state-controlled forests have degraded badly over the years. Rising population pressure also seems to be undermining the efficacy or even the persistence of these age-old local institutions.

Most often women are denied the rights to emotional, mental, psychological and physical spaces. The fact that the female body is constantly under pressure to conform and mould into prescribed social and cultural roles brings into question the spaces that need to be protected as well rights that need to be claimed so that women's bodily integrity is respected. This paper highlights the struggles and spaces that Indian women have negotiated in their quest for empowerment.

It uses the monthly averages of the SENSEX and NIFTY to measure stock prices in April 1996-June 2006. For the same period, the month-end yields on 10-year government security and treasury bills (15-91 days) are used to measure long-term and short-term interest rates, respectively. The paper finds that there is a long-run relationship between interest rates and stock prices. Both long-term and short-term interest rates affect stock prices. The long-term interest rates are found to affect stock prices negatively, whereas short-term interest rates affect stock prices positively. In addition, the SENSEX is found to be more responsive to changes in interest rates than the NIFTY.

Vol. 43, No. 16 (Apr. 19 - 25, 2008)||special articles||Democracy and Economic Transformation in India||Partha Chatterjee||With the changes in India over the past 25 years, there is now a new dynamic logic that ties the operations of "political society" (comprising the peasantry, artisans and petty producers in the informal sector) with the hegemonic role of the bourgeoisie in "civil society". This logic is provided by the requirement of reversing the effects of primitive accumulation of capital with activities like anti-poverty programmes. This is a necessary political condition for the continued rapid growth of corporate capital. The state, with its mechanisms of electoral democracy, becomes the field for the political negotiation of demands for the transfer of resources, through fiscal and other means, from the accumulation economy to programmes aimed at providing the livelihood needs of the poor. Electoral democracy makes it unacceptable for the government to leave the marginalised groups without the means of labour and to fend for themselves, since this carries the risk of turning them into the "dangerous classes".

Nagaraj||The Indian economy turned around after 2002-03, clocking a growth rate of 8.7 per cent per annum, based on an industrial recovery, a sustained growth in services (especially communications and business services), and growing exports during a boom in world trade. However, the poor and deteriorating quality of statistics seem to question the extent of the upswing. But the fact that growth has been underpinned by an unprecedented rise in the fixed investment to GÏP ratio cannot be denied. For the first time, consumer credit in a low interest rate regime has boosted the demand (sweetened by fiscal concessions) for consumer durables and housing. However, the deceleration in agriculture (particularly foodgrains) and a decline in the share of fixed investment in infrastructure and industry cast doubt prima fade on the optimism about the future.
Vol. 43, No. 15 (Apr. 12 - 18, 2008)||special articles||Communalism, Secularism and Indian Historical Films (1940-46)||Urvi Mukhopadhyay||This article investigates invocations of the medieval period in the popular historical films made during the height of còmmunalised politics before Partition. The themes were chosen to reveal a complex process of negotiation between the elite and popular interpretations of the medieval period that affected the political culture in the 1940s. The historical narratives of figures in the film industry, who responded to the contemporary political culture of the time, explain the role of agency of people of the non-elite. The partisan nature of communalist/ secularist positions of the time can be understood by a study of these films.

Burke||Many organisations campaigning on behalf of the Tibetan community persist in seeking some form of independence, self-determination or autonomy. In light of the evolving position of China in the world it seems that this stance (and indeed the stance of the Dalai Lama's government in exile) is becoming ever more unrealistic. Tibetan reactions to China's changing position in the world and the dwindling of western attention to their cause are changing the way Tibetans articulate their problems, priorities and indeed select their government. What are these concerns and how did they come to be so pressing?

Even if the authorities follow conservative fiscal and monetary policies, the country can still face a balance of payments crisis. Moreover, the foreign exchange drain, highly volatile and mainly on account of profit-taking by foreign institutional investors, is currently very high in relation to India's gross domestic product, prompting a comparison with the tribute extracted by the British during the latter part of the colonial era.

In the early colonial records, agues and fevers were seen primarily as a threat to European visitors to the tropics, including the colonisers. In contrast, the fevers of specific regions were identified as localised ailments endemic among the local population and somehow connected to the specifics of local ecology and the indolent nature of the natives. With the triumph of tropical medicine between 1880 and 1905, localised fevers rapidly gave way to malaria and the identification of malaria parasites and vectors between 1880 and 1905, which came to be seen as embodying the characteristic disorders of the tropics, reinforcing certain hegemonic views about the colonial subject and the potential benefits of western medicine.

Until 1903, medical men had little idea about the true nature of this disease, which spread rapidly in the wake of the opening up of communication by rail and road. British medical intervention against kala-azar succeeded only in 1919 with the introduction of the antimony treatment. Till then, and after, the powers that be failed to prevent and eradicate the disease, with a lack of qualified personnel, funds, treatment centres, sanitary measures and, above all, political will hampering whatever modest efforts were made.

It shows how and to what extent some of the widely held ideas of the colonial era on environmental causation contributed to and, at the same time, shaped a kind of environmental awareness, which became a part of medico-social thinking in India. It also adds a new dimension to the thinking on malaria in colonial India by situating the environmental paradigm within a social and economic context. This links it to other issues of social significance, deepening our understanding of the response to the disease.

The making of the Burdwan fever epidemic can hardly be ascribed to conveniently traceable intentions or a straightforward series of causes. The history of the unfolding of the epidemic hints at a "game of relationships".

This paper traces the philosophical discourse, distinguishing between the orthodox version and the newer and more flexible version of neoclassical economics. Can we find an alternative approach that breaks away from the limitations of neoclassical economics?

Rakhe and Dhirendra Gajbhiye||The Thirteenth Finance Commission has been constituted against the backdrop of strong fiscal correction and consolidation by most of the state governments. The present paper analyses the trend and composition of fiscal transfers in India and puts forward some options/proposals which the THFC may consider. In the context of fiscal restructuring, the THFC could emphasise the quality of fiscal correction. The THFC may consider widening the shareable pool of central taxes by including service tax. In the context of fiscal efficiency, apart from tax effort, the THFC may give adequate weight to non-tax collection effort. The THFC may also consider providing more purpose-specific grants for the social sectors such as education, health, etc, along with considering "the need to enhance social sector expenditure" as a criterion for horizontal sharing.

It focuses on immunisation coverage (a) at the all India level, (b) in rural and urban areas, (c) in Bihar, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, and (d) for three groups of states, the empowered action group, north-eastern and other states. The study applies a logistic regression model to National Family Health Survey-2 (1998-99) data. The likelihood of immunisation increases with urban residence, mother's education level, mother's exposure to mass media, mother's awareness about immunisation, antenatal care during pregnancy and other such variables. Further research with both demand-and supply-side issues and current data is critical to help policymakers make the immunisation programme universal.

Raveendran||This paper attempts to define the common people of India in terms of levels of consumption and examines their socio-economic profile in different periods of time since the early 1990s with a view to assessing how the economic growth process has impacted on their lives. The findings should worry everyone. Despite high growth, more than three-fourths of Indians are poor and vulnerable with a level of consumption not more than twice the official poverty line. This proportion of the population which can be categorised as the "common people" is much higher among certain social groups, especially for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. There is also evidence to suggest that inequality is widening between the common people and the better-off sections of society.

The preliminary estimates were noticeable for the large downward revisions of GDP estimates of China and India. This article suggests that there were five reasons for the revisions in the fifth round. The single most important factor was the adjustment to productivity estimates of government services; a correction was required but the ICP perhaps produced too large an adjustment for China and India.

It is this failure that underlies the spurt in rural violence that has highlighted once again the issue of the poor's access to land, water and forests. It is gradually being recognised that further deterioration of economic, social and political conditions of the rural poor can neither be arrested nor reversed without a significant policy shift towards a comprehensive land reform programme. Land reform means the disempowerment of a small but very powerful number of people. In a democratic society land reform can be undertaken sans bloodshed but not without tears.

By living in Zakir Nagar its residents felt that they had built a barricade against the religion-based violence and discrimination that had become part of their collective memory. However, how people experienced discrimination and the insecurities they felt were affected not only by their religious identity, but also by their age, class, and gender.

Some of the various problems that arise due to the peculiar circumstances pertaining to tribal India, and the administrative machinery in place to guide the Special policies concerning forest conservation and tribal people are also elaborated upon. The article brings out a number of field-level issues that deal with traditional conservation in tribal India as well as the limitations and pitfalls in entrusting the execution of the act to the gram sabha.

Alternative forms of treatment continue to flourish, whether by traditional healers or by Christian faith healers. Three modes of healing - the biomedical, the traditional and Christian faith healing - are examined in this paper. Each can be seen to cater for particular needs, and so long as present socio-economic conditions remain as they are in the tribal regions, and the public healthcare System exists as it does, it seems unlikely that there will be any significant change.

While the project is seen as a solution to the drinking water problem in the State, this study shows that it has not been able to ensure adequate water supply in a regular and dependable manner to the covered regions. The project is also financially non-viable. This paper raises basic questions about the usefulness of long distance Pipelines for transferring water to distant places for drinking purposes. It shows that there is a need to look for workable alternatives that augment local resources.

As a remedial measure, zoning was introduced which prohibited mechanised fishing in the inshore waters and proscribed mechanised fishing during monsoons. This study presents a theoretical analysis of the measure and analyses the available data to comprehend its impact upon fisheries. It finds that zoning has had a positive impact upon the resource distribution pattems, but that it would offer only a short-term solution if the larger Problems are left unaddressed.

Both these countries recorded high economic growth rates and large poverty reductions during the late 1990s following a set of economic reforms. However, while Vietnam recorded large reductions in its undernourishment rates, the reverse was true for India. The Vietnamese, with their intervention programmes aimed at nutrient enhancement, have managed their growth process ensuring a positive association between reduction in expenditure-based poverty and calorie-based under-nutrition, in a manner that has lessons for other high growth achievers such as India.

This paper tests for the hypothesis by distinguishing between non-timber forest produce for sale and for self- consumptions, using the National Sample Survey Organisation data for a sample of 78,000 households in Bihar, Kamataka, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. It finds that households collecting only for sale purposes are not likely to be income poor. They may collect because they have more secure property rights, greater access to forests and/or markets and may even be asset rich.

It can be both, a boon and a curse-depending on the circumstances two sides of the same coin. Nationalism tends to be negative when people confront each other along the lines of national divisions; it can be productive enough when social divisions and hostilities tend to be based on other identities, such as religion, community or ethnicity. Central to understanding the contingent variability of the role of nationalism is the need to see nationality as one identity among many that we all have.

Two major changes have since taken place: (a) villages get 24 hour three-phase power supply for domestic use, in schools, hospitals, village industries, all subject to metered tariff; and (b) tubewell owners get eight hours/day of power but of full voltage and on a pre-announced schedule. It has, however, offered a mixed bag to medium and large farmers and hit marginal farmers and the landless. This article offers an assessment of the impact of Jyotirgram, and argues that with some refinements it presents a model that other states can follow with profit.

Vol. 43, No. 6 (Feb. 9 - 15, 2008)||special articles||Price Trends in India and Their Implications for Measuring Poverty||Angus Deaton||National Sample Survey data on the unit values of a large number of foods can be used to compute price index numbers that can be compared with the official national price indices, the Consumer Price Index for Agricultural Labourers for rural India, and the Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers for urban India. This paper finds that over the five years from 1999-2000 to 2004-05, the food component of the CPIAL understated the rate of food price inflation. This understatement can be attributed to the use of long outdated weights (from 1983), and the resultant over-weighting of cereals, whose prices fell relative to other foods. The overall weight of food in the CPIAL is also too large, so that the growth in the general CPIAL was understated during this period when food prices fell relative to non-food prices. Under conservative assumptions, the paper calculates that the five-year growth in the reported CPIAL of 10.6 per cent should have been 14.3 per cent. The nominal poverty lines are also understated. As a result, and ignoring other problems with the counts, the official poverty ratio of 28.3 per cent for rural India in 2004-05 should be closer to 31 per cent; at current rates of rural poverty reduction, this eliminates more than three years of progress.

In Uttar Pradesh, the assertion of the Bahujan Samaj Party has initiated a new era of democratisation, while the upsurge of dalit castes through Buddhist conversion has brought about social change in Maharashtra. Yet, both these separate phenomena suffer from the disadvantages of not addressing vital issues raised by Ambedkar. This paper tries to synthesise a model out of the dialectics of the socio-political movements in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh from the vantage point of Ambedkarite philosophy.
Vol. 43, No. 6 (Feb. 9 - 15, 2008)||special articles||Economic Growth and Regional Inequality in India||Gaurav Nayyar||Given the disparate levels of income and development among the states in India, do they exhibit any tendency in the data to converge to common steady-state paths? In a panel data study for 16 Indian states for the period from 1978-79 to 2002-03, it is found that (a) the states are not converging to identical levels of per capita income in the steady-state; (b) once factors that affect steady-state levels of income are controlled for, the poor states grow faster on average than the rich ones; and (c) there is an increase in the dispersion of per capita incomes across states over time. This is indicative of Indian states converging to increasingly divergent steady-states, which may be attributed to increasing inter-state disparities in levels of private and public investment and an insignificant equalising impact of centre-state government transfers.
Vol. 43, No. 6 (Feb. 9 - 15, 2008)||notes||Estimating Costs of Achieving Global Goals||Sanjay Reddy and Antoine Heuty||Estimates of the costs of achieving intermediate or long-term global development goals are subject to uncertainties that go well beyond those in applied economic contexts, and exceed the level that is tolerable. It therefore seems inappropriate that such. estimates should be relied on heavily to determine global resource mobilisation targets and priorities for action for lengthy planning horizons. Consequently, an alternative planning and resource allocation framework that is flexible and learning-oriented is needed. In this note, we explore one important class of reasons for uncertainties concerning the validity of recent estimates of the intermediate or long-term cost of achieving global goals, which stem from the unknown nature of the "development production function" and its (dual) cost function.

Among the several factors behind this, two which stand out are the economic reforms of the early 1990s and the sharp increase in the savings rate following bank nationalisation in 1969. This outstanding aggregate growth, however, comes with growing inequality and (declining but still) unacceptably high poverty. It is argued that this is partly a consequence of globalisation and gives rise to novel policy dilemmas. The need is for multi-country coordination of policies of a kind that has little precedence. India should use its improving global standing to initiate such an international effort.

On the average, individuals pay about twice the official amount to obtain a licence and very few take the legally required driving test, resulting in many unqualified yet licenced drivers. The magnitude of distortions in the allocation of licences increases with citizens' willingness to pay for licences. These results support the view that corruption does not merely reflect transfers from citizens to bureaucrats but that it distorts allocation. The paper also shows that partial anti-corruption measures have only a limited impact because players in this system adapt to the new environment. Specifically, a ban on agents at one regional transport office is associated with a high percentage of unqualified drivers overcoming the residency requirement and obtaining licences at other RTOS.

Does this indicate a fundamental change in the party's approach to economic reforms, or a temporary stratagem in the implementation of its original programme?

Indeed, cheap, skilled and docile labour is the main source of competitive advantage of such suppliers in large retailer-driven global commodity chains.

The civil war was a marker of the trend in TV coverage of conflict zones, the first victim being the news cycle - the focus is always on the "hot news" which becomes "cold" very quickly, shifting the Spotlight on to the next "hot spot".

The prevailing mythology is that construction of metro rail Systems will somehow solve the problems of the future. A review of urban mass transport Systems over the past Century shows that metro Systems were the obvious choice when relatively inexpensive cars and two-wheelers were not available. With the introduction of efficient buses, Computer and information technologiesto manage large fleets, and the need to have flexible, medium capacity Systems that go dose to homes and destinations, bus rapid transit Systems with dedicated lanes seem to be the only choice for providing affordable mass transport in our cities.

Vasanth Rao||Fiscal decentralisation to rural local governments in India is meaningful only when the panchayats have adequate untied funds to provide public Services assigned to them which require the assignment of tax powers. This paper shows that revenue mobilisation by rural local bodies is abysmally Iow. The assignment does not include any important revenue handles and the panchayats are not able to exploit properly even the only notable tax base assigned to them — the property tax. The paper argues that it is necessary to take a re-look at the tax powers of panchayats. It is also important to build administrative and enforcement capacity. An essential precondition for building such capacity is to create a reliable data and information System.

Baru and Madhurima Nundy||This papertraces the evolution, structure and characteristics of public-private partnerships in Healthcare over the last six decades. It argues that these partnerships have broken down the traditional boundaries between the market and the State, leading to the emergence of multiple actors with multiple roles and newer institutional arrangements that have redefined their role, power and authority. The fragmentation of role and authority has serious consequences for comprehensiveness, governance and accountability of health Services.

While the rationale for PPP is inefficiency of the government, the means offered to overcome it actually promise no relief or improvement, PPP is not an idea, but rather an ideology which promotes privatisation as a means of reducing the government's responsibility to increase the number of schools.

It also discusses a number of spillover effects for the rest of the economy and one of the more important effects is the potential to develop a major manufacturing hub in the country for telecom equipment and for downstream industries such as semiconductor devices. The telecom industry in India could slowly become an example of the service sector acting as a fillip to the growth of the manufacturing sector.

The cyber presence of Babr¡ Masjid mediates competing historical narratives about Indian Islam, the political discourse of secular and constitutional citizenship, and questions of minority rights and religious difference. This paper describes some of the modes in which Indian Muslims use the internet to negotiate and express identity claims.

It also ranks states according to the proportionate values of the three effects with respect to the total change in electricity consumption. In this context, the paper proposes relying on the Divisia index rather than simple adding up methods. This analysis is based on secondary cross section data of the sectoral electricity consumption and sectoral output share for three benchmark years, 1990-91,1995-96 and 2000-01. In the study, large variations among the states have been found in the identified effects for the early 1990s and post 1990s.

This new politics – part of a process of secularisation – is radically different from the pre- independence separatist trends. Except at the surface, in the form of demands for reservations and quotas, there is nothing in common in the nature and content of Muslim politics then and now.

To eliminate poverty, economic policy therefore has to accelerate growth, focus programmes on agriculture and rural development in the poorer states and target subsidies at the bottom 40 per cent. The most critical areas distinguishing state growth performance have been modern (registered) manufacturing and commerce.

Mills in India found it hard to deal with competition from Japan until protective tariffs came to their rescue. Several contemporaries attributed the outcome to the industriousness of the workers, and one viewpoint held the mode of labour organisation in the Indian mills to be responsible for high labour turnover and neglect of training. The paper discusses this perspective and suggests that the theme of labour organisation has enduring relevance for the study of comparative industrialisation.

Using empirical evidence on the global exports of ITA goods and the performance of different groups of ITA member-countries, the article makes the case for complementing trade liberalisation with capacity-building so that the ITA could become an effective strategy for developing countries to bridge the digital divide. Substantial capabilities in ICT production and use have been developed by some developing countries, which provide fresh ideas for a southern system of ICT innovation for development.

Most political parties affirm the necessity of economic reforms. Yet, this affirmation belies support for the same among large sections of the populace, particularly the poor. Even more paradoxical is the fact that political parties, despite their emphasis on policies related to the economy in their respective manifestos, tend to rely on identity issues for mobilisation. This article tries to explain the reasons for this puzzle.
