Vol. 43, No. 52 (Dec. 27, 2008 - Jan. 2, 2009)||china since 1978||Property Rights and the Social Costs of Transition and Development in China||Carl Riskin||There is considerable ferment over property rights in China today. This paper briefly explores important areas in which social unrest over property rights is currently under way, beginning with a discussion of the general debate about this issue in China, and then moving on to consider such rights in agriculture, intellectual property rights, and property rights in the environmental field. The objective is to indicate how the property rights debate overlaps the argument about social costs of transition, including widening income inequality, environmental devastation, and so on.

Ramana||The environmental clearance offered to the Koodankulam reactors in Tamil Nadu is not based upon a careful examination of all the potential impacts on the environment and livelihoods nor does it incorporate public concerns.
Vol. 43, No. 48 (Nov. 29 - Dec. 5, 2008)||global economic crisis||Languages of Valuation||J. Martinez-Alier||An economic crisis affords an opportunity to put the economy of the rich countries on a different trajectory as regards material and energy flows. Now is the time in those countries for a socio-ecological transition to lower levels of energy and materials use. The crisis might also give an opportunity for a restructuring of social institutions. The objective in rich countries should be to live well without the imperative of economic growth.
Vol. 43, No. 45 (Nov. 8 - 14, 2008)||special articles||India and Bretton Woods II||Aaditya Mattoo and Arvind Subramanian||The G-20 meeting in Washington on 15 November is an opportunity for India to help shape the new global economic architecture in line with its Strategie interests. India should propose short-term crisis response actions and suggest a clear medium-term agenda. On the former, India needs to support globally coordinated actions to help limit the economic downturn, including a political commitment by all countries to keep marketsopen. The medium-term agenda would have, first, reforming the financial architecture, including by strengthening the International Monetary Fund's capacity to respond to crises and enhancing its legitimaey through radical governance reform to give greater say to the emerging powers. Second, securing openness of the trading system, which would require going beyond completing the current Doha agenda in two ways: deepening rules in existing areas (especially Services) and developing rules in new areas (to deal with undervalued exchange rates, cartelisation of oil markets, investment restrictions and environmental protectionism). Third, reforming governance of the meta-process for global decision-making, including through the creation of a more representative membership than the G-7.
Vol. 43, No. 41 (Oct. 11 - 17, 2008)||perspectives||Contemporary Global Capitalism: Multi-Pronged Crises||Pritam Singh||The grand failure of many a financial institution in the us is one of three such crises that have affected the world today; the others related to oil prices and food shortages. These in sum have broken the back of neoliberal triumphalism, and have resulted in a spatial shift in global capitalism. No wonder, it is time to address alternatives to this greed-driven, unregulated and excess-motivated system. Such an alternative must be based on the principles of ecological sustainability, social justice and democratic participati√∏n.
Vol. 43, No. 37 (Sep. 13 - 19, 2008)||commentary||Globalisation vs India's Forests||Milind Wani and Ashish Kothari||Wanton usage of forest land in the name of development has destroyed efforts towards community- led measures for protection and conservation in Orissa. The laxity in framing adequate environmental laws and the flouting of even the existing laws have had disastrous effects on the livelihoods of forest-dwelling people in the State.
Vol. 43, No. 30 (Jul. 26 - Aug. 1, 2008)||commentary||State Cultivation of the Amarnath Yatra||Gautam Navlakha||The origins of the conflagration in June in Kashmir on forest land allocation for construction of facilities for the Amarnath yatra lie in open State promotion of the pilgrimage. The yatra has caused considerable damage to the economy and ecology of the area. The high-handed actions of the Shri Amarnath Shrine Board only aggravated the Situation.

Vol. 43, No. 23 (Jun. 7 - 13, 2008)||commentary||Re-Engineering the Legal and Policy Regimes on Environment||Manju Menon and Kanchi Kohli||Environment impact assessment was supposed to be a critical tool in environmental decisionmaking. But it has been re-engineered to severely reduce its usefulness as an instrument for public participation in decision-making. This article, written against the backdrop of proposals for a new coastal regulation zone notification, analyses the different characteristics of environmental regulations and the new environment policy, and shows how a new perspective facilitates speedy clearance of projects that affect people's livelihoods and the environment.
Vol. 43, No. 22 (May 31 - Jun. 6, 2008)||review of labour||Soccer Ball Production for Nike in Pakistan||Karin Astrid Siegmann||This paper looks at how Nike's soccer ball suppliers (previous and current) in Sialkot (Pakistan) fare in relation to the company's code of ethics. While minimum required working conditions are implemented, the criteria for social and environmental compliance are not met with. The multinational's decision to withdraw orders from the previous supplier ostensibly due to allegations of child labour and unauthorised subcontracting hit large sections of the workforce, especially rural, low-skilled and female workers. Is it fair for multinationals to cut and run in such cases or should they find a solution to save thousands of livelihoods?
Vol. 43, No. 20 (May 17 - 23, 2008)||notes||Pollution in the Mahanadi: Urban Sewage, Industrial Effluents and Biomedical Waste||Manipadma Jena||The discharge of municipal sewage, industrial effluents and biomedical waste into the Mahanadi has raised concerns about environmental sustainability and also posed a serious threat to the health of people living on the banks. This article critically examines the river pollution caused by the spiralling urbanisation and industrialisation along with dumping of waste by many medical facilities. There is an urgent need to address this enormous challenge which is a direct outcome of inefficient planning and management.
Vol. 43, No. 18 (May 3 - 9, 2008)||special articles||Decentralised Forest Governance in Central Himalayas: A Re-Evaluation of Outcomes||Rinki Sarkar||A study conducted in 45 villages in the central Himalayas assesses the current status of van panchayats, an old institution of decentralised forest governance. It finds that locals are indifferent to the administrative jurisdiction of the forest in the course of their resource extraction activities. There is no quantitative evidence that they are exercising restraint while accessing and using locally governed forests. Collective rule violation appears to be common. The inhabitants are unaware about the long-term ecological implications of their actions. As a consequence, both van panchayat forests as well as the state-controlled forests have degraded badly over the years. Rising population pressure also seems to be undermining the efficacy or even the persistence of these age-old local institutions.
Vol. 43, No. 16 (Apr. 19 - 25, 2008)||notes||Voluntary Sector: Complementing or Replicating the State?||Tanya Jakimow||The 2007 National Policy on the Voluntary Sector aims at creating an enabling environment for voluntary organisations and facilitating their partnership with the government. But it suffers from a major lacuna in that it fails to comprehensively address the central aspects of autonomy, credibility and the nature of partnership itself. Instead of assisting the voluntary sector to take on roles distinct from and complementary to the state's development agenda, it encourages activities commensurate with state approaches.

Vol. 43, No. 15 (Apr. 12 - 18, 2008)||perspectives||Sustainable Development Perspective of Climate Change||Mukul Sanwal||Global environmental problems like climate change should be conceptualised as problems of consumption and not production patterns. A consumption rather than a production-based vision for environmentally sustainable economic growth would make the design and implementation of climate protection, as well as other environmental problems, more effective. Moreover, implementation in the context of international burden sharing, where benefits are not equally shared, requires a very different organising framework that is not based on cost-benefit analysis and commitments to reduce emissions determined in international negotiations, but rather on political justice and transfer of technology.
Vol. 43, No. 12/13 (Mar. 22 - Apr. 4, 2008)||commentary||Measuring Disability in India||Roger Jeffery and Nidhi Singal||Disability status is often transitory or a matter of insidious change. A person's ability to function properly depends to a considerable extent on her/his social and physical environment. One area that slips through the large-scale studies like the census and National Sample Survey is the impact of the state and the market on the lives of people with disabilities. There is a case for a more fundamental re-envisioning of the nature of the disability estimates.
Vol. 43, No. 12/13 (Mar. 22 - Apr. 4, 2008)||epidemics in south asian history||Mapping of Fevers and Colonising the Body in British Ceylon||Kalinga Tudor Silva||This paper identifies paradigmatic shifts in the conceptualisation of fevers in British Ceylon, from agues and fevers in the early 1800s and fevers of particular regions in the mid-1800s to a powerful notion of malaria in the early 1900s. In the early colonial records, agues and fevers were seen primarily as a threat to European visitors to the tropics, including the colonisers. In contrast, the fevers of specific regions were identified as localised ailments endemic among the local population and somehow connected to the specifics of local ecology and the indolent nature of the natives. With the triumph of tropical medicine between 1880 and 1905, localised fevers rapidly gave way to malaria and the identification of malaria parasites and vectors between 1880 and 1905, which came to be seen as embodying the characteristic disorders of the tropics, reinforcing certain hegemonic views about the colonial subject and the potential benefits of western medicine.
Vol. 43, No. 12/13 (Mar. 22 - Apr. 4, 2008)||epidemics in south asian history||Environmental Thoughts and Malaria in Colonial Bengal: A Study in Social Response||Sujata Mukherjee||This study re-examines the notions in colonial India about the causes of malaria, specifically discussing the environmental reasons pointed to at the time. It shows how and to what extent some of the widely held ideas of the colonial era on environmental causation contributed to and, at the same time, shaped a kind of environmental awareness, which became a part of medico-social thinking in India. It also adds a new dimension to the thinking on malaria in colonial India by situating the environmental paradigm within a social and economic context. This links it to other issues of social significance, deepening our understanding of the response to the disease.

Had the plants come up, it would have been an ecological disaster.

Sriraman||A close look at the Railway Budget 2008-09 to understand the real success achieved and a highlighting of some matters of concern. The complementary nature of the relationship between the two main modes of transportation, rail and road, needs to be promoted in a much more significant way if efficiency and environmental concerns are to be met. The road map set out for the next five years seems to provide a clear framework for action and implementation.

The court has effectively taken over the day-to-day governance of Indian forests leading to negative social, ecological and administrative effects.
