At the national level, reported premarital sex is still fairly low among women and somewhat higher among men. The data show that ever married women are more likely to report premarital sex compared to currently unmarried women. Among unmarried women and men who report premarital sexual activity, the distributions vary by place of residence, occupational status, level of education, and level of household wealth. Unmarried women who are aware of HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases are less likely to have had premarital sex. Notably, there is a significant gender dimension in reporting of premarital sexual activity, pointing the way for further research.||Lekha Subaiya

Despite an improvement in recent years, the fiscal situation continues to be a matter of concern when off-budget liabilities and other fiscal risks are considered. With rising oil prices on the one hand and a surge in capital flows on the other, calibrating the transfer system in tune with counter-cyclical fiscal policy stance is a formidable challenge. This paper argues that irrespective of the wording of the terms of reference, the Commission would do well to focus on its primary task of recommending transfers to serve the objective of equity and incentives. While it is required to take into account a number of considerations, the focus should be on the transfer system. As an impartial body, the Commission should make a fair assessment of the central as well as state governments, ignoring the asymmetries in the wording of the TOR. As regards the transfer system itself is concerned, the paper argues that although it may be difficult to make drastic changes in the relative shares of the states, the Commission should give up the gap filling approach. Instead, after recommending tax devolution, the Commission should recommend grants to fully equalise expenditures on elementary education and basic healthcare. It is also possible to incenti vise the transfer system for even those states that have a better record of providing education and healthcare to improve the quality of these services.||M.

This paper finds that over the five years from 1999-2000 to 2004-05, the food component of the CPIAL understated the rate of food price inflation. This understatement can be attributed to the use of long outdated weights (from 1983), and the resultant over-weighting of cereals, whose prices fell relative to other foods. The overall weight of food in the CPIAL is also too large, so that the growth in the general CPIAL was understated during this period when food prices fell relative to non-food prices. Under conservative assumptions, the paper calculates that the five-year growth in the reported CPIAL of 10.6 per cent should have been 14.3 per cent. The nominal poverty lines are also understated. As a result, and ignoring other problems with the counts, the official poverty ratio of 28.3 per cent for rural India in 2004-05 should be closer to 31 per cent; at current rates of rural poverty reduction, this eliminates more than three years of progress.||Angus Deaton

Until then, the major women's groups concentrated almost exclusively on fighting sexual stereotypes and ignored all political and economic issues. This restricted their appeal to middle class women since it was economic issues that were more important for women from the lower classes.

However, this linguistic and cultural diversity has come under attack in different periods of history and has threatened the existence of many of the minority languages, mainly those which are numerically less represented and also those which are powerless or are of less utility in terms of social mobility. The paper discusses different contexts, starting from the colonial period to the recent National Knowledge Commission Report (2006) that tended to undermine the languages of less power in Indian education.||S.

It examines the process of land market development in the former Punjab from when private ownership of land was established in mid-19th century, up to the present. It is found that as against the assumption of the classical rent theory, the price of land has been increasing much faster than rent. The differential growth rate between rent and the price of land is attributable, among other things, to the unregulated land market and excess liquidity at the micro level. The rapidly increasing capital gains in land transactions is a land bubble. It has to be realised that the bubble in India and Pakistan is difficult to burst, since it is mostly financed from outside the financial market. If the land bubble is left unattended to, the disparity between receivers and payers of rent will widen and it will retard private as well as the public investment necessary for development in the near future.||S.

This logic is provided by the requirement of reversing the effects of primitive accumulation of capital with activities like anti-poverty programmes. This is a necessary political condition for the continued rapid growth of corporate capital. The state, with its mechanisms of electoral democracy, becomes the field for the political negotiation of demands for the transfer of resources, through fiscal and other means, from the accumulation economy to programmes aimed at providing the livelihood needs of the poor. Electoral democracy makes it unacceptable for the government to leave the marginalised groups without the means of labour and to fend for themselves, since this carries the risk of turning them into the "dangerous classes".||Partha Chatterjee

"Bourgeois democrats" would want to preserve the country's capitalistic character, while the "revolutionary left" will make every effort to give it a transitional character to bring socialism on to the nation's agenda. "The reformist left" will vacillate between the two courses but predominantly forge alliances with the "bourgeois democrats".||Mahesh Maskey,Mary Deschene
11/10/2008-17/10/2008||special articles||40278055||Likely Impact of Reforming Water Supply and Sewerage Services in Delhi||This study was undertaken to gain an understanding of the baseline water supply and sewerage services in Delhi, and assess consumer coping strategies and associated costs, their preferences for service improvements, willingness to pay and affordability for the preferred options. For this purpose, a representative sample survey of around 8,000 households and about 2,000 non-domestic consumers was carried out. The survey results bring out the deficiencies in services, and the significant coping costs the consumers are bearing. The survey data reveals that the consumers are willing to pay - and can afford - the extra cost that service improvement will entail. The analysis of survey data indicates that, for poor households in informal settlements, substantial improvement in water supply can be made by introducing/implementing paid group connections. Significant social gains, which could be as high as Rs 5,500 to Rs 8,000 million per annum, are expected from the efficiency improvements in the present system and other reforms that could be undertaken by the Delhi Jal Board.||Smita Misra,Bishwanath Goldar

In the early colonial records, agues and fevers were seen primarily as a threat to European visitors to the tropics, including the colonisers. In contrast, the fevers of specific regions were identified as localised ailments endemic among the local population and somehow connected to the specifics of local ecology and the indolent nature of the natives. With the triumph of tropical medicine between 1880 and 1905, localised fevers rapidly gave way to malaria and the identification of malaria parasites and vectors between 1880 and 1905, which came to be seen as embodying the characteristic disorders of the tropics, reinforcing certain hegemonic views about the colonial subject and the potential benefits of western medicine.||Kalinga Tudor Silva

Based mainly on secondary data, the analysis here suggests that the relatively high prevalence of domestic service and the tradition of inducting girl children into it have led to this trend. A complex interaction of historical, cultural and social practices, together with economic factors, determine women's work in general and that of girl children in particular. A significant factor in this context is the increasing urban affluence in the state led by the growth of the service sector in the recent years.||Deepita Chakravarty,Ishita Chakravarty

But plural societies tend to be stamped by deep disagreements on the basic norms that should govern the polity. For this reason alone, these societies can prove deeply divided and fractious. How do defenders of dialogue establish the preconditions for dialogue among participants? How do agents who wish to put forth a particular point of view establish their credibility: that their reflection and their proposed courses of action are in the public interest, and not in the pursuit of some selfish private gain? How can communication among agents be enabled at all insofar as these agents can be persuaded to modify or moderate their original position in and through the process of dialogue?

6/12/2008-12/12/2008||special articles||40278268||Investment and Growth in India under Liberalisation: Asymmetries and Instabilities||This paper makes the case that the growth trajectory of the Indian economy in the post-1991 liberalisation period is characterised by an inherent source of instability in manufacturing and industrial growth that distinguishes this period from the 1980s. This instability is a result of an investment-growth asymmetry that flows from a combination of a services-intensive growth pattern and a manufacturing-intensive investment pattern, which reflects the pattern of demand expansion within the domestic economy as well as in external markets, as also reliance on private corporate investment as the driver of the economy's investment process. In such circumstances, maintaining the balance between capacity creation and demand expansion in the manufacturing sector becomes impossible. Investment is thus prone to a high degree of instability, which, via its effects on demand, makes industrial growth too highly unstable. The services-intensive growth trajectory after 1991 is therefore more correctly viewed as one which is unable to fully utilise the capital accumulation potential of the economy rather than as a trajectory that is cheap in the use of capital. Correcting this problem however requires measures that are inconsistent with a liberalised economic policy regime.||Surajit Mazumdar

This difference disappears once their lower Grade Point Averages are taken into account, suggesting that the large wage difference is due to the weaker (on average) academic Performance of SC/ST candidates.

These agreements tend to push trade liberalisation much further than is possible under the multilateral trade regime. These RTAS also include rules which are likely to reduce the policy space for developing countries. This paper investigates whether signing of an RTA with a developed country necessarily leads to increased market access in that country. The findings suggest that this is not always so. But, on the other hand, developing countries face stricter intellectual property regimes, aggressive environment and labour clauses and extremely restrictive bilateral investment treaties, which impose some obvious and serious costs on the industrialisation process of developing countries. It concludes that the gains from north- south RTAS are doubtful while there will be some obvious costs.||Parthapratim Pal

It recommends using only the interest rate instrument for inflation targeting. This is likely to result in prohibitive interest rates.

The two most important external drivers are local industrialisation and social policy in a broad sense. It is shown thatthe overall effect seems to be a centripetal tendency in agrarian structure, with a movement towards a strengthened position for family farming and for the underdogs in the old agrarian society to leave agriculture altogether, seeking improved life chances in the non-agrarian economy, both inside the villages and in the wider economy.||Göran Djurfeldt,Venkatesh Athreya,N.

The immediate challenge is to arrest the loss of confidence of private investment and the attendant tightening of liquidity. The only way this can be achieved is by sustaining growth - through a major expansion of public investment in infrastructure and social programmes, financed by a monetised budget deficit. Such a deficit will infuse liquidity and well-chosen public outlays will revive growth. Inflation is a risk in such a strategy, but it is now a question of playing at the margin - the risk we are willing to take on inflation in order to raise domestic expenditure that would lead to faster growth.||Arjun Sengupta

At the poverty line, the minimum calorie requirements used for defining this line in the base year are not being met in later years. While the official poverty line used the food requirement norm from nutrition science, this paper employs the food consumption requirement derived from the Engel curve as the norm to arrive at a measure of food consumption deprivation. It is shown that food deprivation levels do not reflect the same pattern that the traditional poverty indices depict, questioning the usefulness of traditional poverty indices for measuring food deprivation.||T.

But whether this means improved availability of market information or better understanding of complex instruments, in neither case will greater transparency reduce systemic risk in financial markets. Indeed, in some cases greater transparency could make things worse. Regulators must now abandon their belief in the tired trinity of greater transparency, more disclosure and better risk management by firms. Instead they must turn to finding ways to develop a systemic approach to regulation, including pro-cyclical provisioning and system-wide stress testing, and confront the vicious market cycle of rising asset prices accompanied by higher leverage, and the even more vicious cycle running in reverse.||John Eatwell,Robert Reoch

It is observed that the traditional positive concentration-markup relationship does not hold in a dynamic context, when controlled for various structural aspects of the market, firms' strategies and policies of the government. In other words, industries with greater market concentration do not necessarily enjoy higher PCM in the long run, possibly due to entry of new firms, x-inefficiency of the incumbents and deceleration in industrial production.||Pulak Mishra

Substantial declines have occurred in fertility over the period encompassing the three rounds. The use of contraceptives has become more widely prevalent with a majority of couples wanting to stop childbearing at two or three children. Spatial variation is also noticeable with religious differentials being very small or negligible in some states. At the national level, religious differentials are narrowing though it is difficult to say when a convergence could occur. However, fertility for all religious groups is expected to fall further towards the replacement level and possibly to below this level.||Manoj Alagarajan,P. M. Kulkarni

It looks atthe perpetuation of Naga nationalism in the framework of Laclau and Mouffe's discourse theory and Gramsci's concept of hegemony. Building upon earlier studies that have established the potential of the internet to promote nationalist ideologies, it brings to light how particular political ideologies are constructed and reinforced through the internet to address issues intrinsic to the Nagas who have historically lived independently with little interaction with non- Naga groups. The nationalist ideology placed in the context of discourse theory is methodologically approached through analysis of texts in political web sites dedicated to the Naga issue.||Maya Ranganathan,Shiva Roy-Chowdhury

It focuses on immunisation coverage (a) at the all India level, (b) in rural and urban areas, (c) in Bihar, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal, and (d) for three groups of states, the empowered action group, north-eastern and other states. The study applies a logistic regression model to National Family Health Survey-2 (1998-99) data. The likelihood of immunisation increases with urban residence, mother's education level, mother's exposure to mass media, mother's awareness about immunisation, antenatal care during pregnancy and other such variables. Further research with both demand-and supply-side issues and current data is critical to help policymakers make the immunisation programme universal.||Nilanjan Patra

These explanations problematically construe India's "paradigm shift" as the outcome of a non-ideological and "inevitable" process of intellectual evolution among policy "technocrats". The paper proposes an opposing view of the policy process, in which conflict is central, and thq deliberate exercise of power is crucial to why some policy alternatives are privileged and selected over others. It is suggested that far from being the one inescapable conclusion to the lengthy debates over economic strategy that were typical to India's economic history, the 1991 reforms arose out of the political defeat of many credible alternatives. These reforms represented the surprising eclipsing of not only an alternative economic paradigm, but also the reversal of almost 50 years of nationalist anxiety over India's position of disadvantage within an inequitable global order. In light of this, the "paradigm shift" is viewed as a political event that might have been eluded under different political circumstances, and not as an historically necessary phenomenon brought to light by an elite team of "experts".||Mitu Sengupta

The RBI should follow an alternative model of banking regulation that will have three pillars. The first should be that the economic cycle must be put close to the centre of banking regulation, since this is the source of market and systemic failure. The second should be a focus on systemically important distinctions, such as maturity mismatches and leverage. And the third pillar would be to require banks to either self-insure or pay an insurance premium to taxpayers against the risk that the taxpayer will be required to bail them out.||Avinash D. Persaud

The study uses the valuable time series information collected as part of the "comprehensive scheme" of the ministry of agriculture. After surveying the pattern of changes in inputs as well as costs of cultivation vis-à-vis the wholesale price index (a proxy for the general price level), the value of inputs which are exclusively market-purchased are analysed. A study of the weighted average of these costs establishes unequivocally that the costs of farm inputs increased very sharply in the post-reform period.||M. Raghavan

It is found that the proportion of households classified as "deprived" on the basis of the HDS has recorded a secular declining trend over this period and that the quantum of decline in the proportions of the deprived is strongly associated with improvements in reproductive and child health parameters. Analysis of the data on malnourishment of children reveals that the availability of some basic amenities at the household level makes a significant contribution to children's growth and prevention of malnutrition.||K.

Though Gandhi still commands veneration from many, he is also someone everyone loves to hate. Some critics fault him for particular positions, such as his support of the Khilafat movement, his inexplicable views on the Bihar earthquake, his deployment of Hindu imagery or idioms of speech such as 'Ram Rajya', and so on. Other critics, arguing from specific ideological positions, are inclined to find systemic shortcomings in Gandhi's views. This paper, focusing in the latter half to a greater extent on modernist and especially feminist readings of Gandhi, suggests that the feminist reading is fraught with more ambivalence than is commonly recognised, and in somewhat unexpected ways. It is argued that though Gandhi may not have been his own best critic, his critics have also not done him the justice of attempting to understand how he negotiated the various critical worldviews that he encountered.||Vinay Lal

This paper attempts to fill the gap by first proposing a general methodology for a legal reading of a court judgment. Itthen provides a careful analysis of the A KThakur judgment and shows that the ratio in the case is a narrow one with no radical departures from the Court's existing doctrine on reservation law and policy. The paper then assesses the Court's approach to the problems of identifying beneficiariesand suggests that the Court closely correlate the intrusivenessof affirmative action measures chosen and the moral justifications for the same. It concludes by addressing several policy proposals that aim to restructure affirmative action and suggest alternative frameworksof legal doctrine that will allow the Court to effectively respond to these demands for reform.||Sudhir Krishnaswamy,Madhav Khosla

However, some high and middle income states lag behind, continuing to accumulate unsustainably high levels of debt and guarantees. The majority of states have relied more on enhancing their own revenues than on contracting expenditures, which is welcome in the context of the squeeze on infrastructure and social service expenditures that states had experienced over the 1990s. Those that have committed to fiscal responsibility and have achieved significant correction now face the challenge of translating outlays to outcomes. Those that lag behind must first address the challenge of fiscal discipline, learning from the success of others. It woy Id be advisable to target the end-of-year stock of outstanding debt and guarantees, in addition to current account balance ("golden rule"). Monitoring of end-of-year stock rather than annual flows would enhance year-to-year flexibility in states' fiscal management, while remaining within an agreed correction path.||V. J.

Contrary to popular perception, primary food articles – cereals and pulses – have not had much to do with rising prices.||R. Sthanumoorthy

Concern is also expressed about social obligations, delinking the government from banks and greater freedom to private banks - these too are not valid concerns.

This vision is based entirely on the fascination with the Shanghai/Pudong Skyline, without any Substantive understanding of orfacts about the growth in the Chinese city. True, there has been rapid growth in Shanghai, but most of this growth has been to the benefit of corporations (public sector and foreign controlled), little has gone to the city's households. Since the late 1990s, the poor of Shanghai have in fact seen a relative decline in incomös vis-à-vis the richer groups.

It focuses on the country's regional and healthcare policies to illustrate how it has dealt with issues of inequality and insecurity over time. The prevailing view now is that the market is necessary but it must be embedded in society.

A "new" China has emerged, economically powerful, showcased by the Olympics and spurred by nationalistic sentiments. But beneath this shiny surface there is growing polarisation between those with extreme wealth at the top and hundreds of millions in the working classes who have lost power and face a bleak struggle for survival in the global capitalist market. Despite ameliorative measures by the current leadership, there is no fundamental plan to reverse this ever widening divide. In the face of the deepening global economic crisis, these divisions are swelling. China is suffering its most severe downturn in decades, and working class protests are spreading. The Chinese left is re-emerging, but remains largely isolated from these popular forces. Only by beginning to bridge that gap, can China once again find a socialist alternative.||Robert Weil

A caste- ridden rural society with an adivasi fringe needs better characterisation than that offered by Partha Chatterjee in "Democracy and Economic Transformation in India" (19 April 2008). The 1990s certainly mark a break in Indian economic history but perhaps in a direction opposite to the one Chatterjee suggests. Over- deterministic attribution of hegemonic powers to corporate capital takes away from the centrality of struggle and the contingent unpredictability of historical processes. We need to practise the "subversive" history advocated by D D Kosambi, which refuses to fit snugly into prefabricated schema of the kind imposed by Chatterjee.

Unless and until the aspirations of the three ethnically distinct regions of the State (Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh) are reconciled, there will always be pretexts for conflict.

Many are not effective participants on account of ignorance or disinterest, disability or deterrence. This analysis considers two separate arenas for enlarging the pool of effective participants, one related to sports and other to social mobility. In both cases, this paper finds the plausibility of an explanation based on effective participation rates. It examines what country characteristics are associated with greater success in the Olympics at the macro level by considering indicators such as health, education, and especially three variables of information and access (road length per unit of land area, the share of urban population and radios per capita). It also analyses the opportunities and achievements in the villages of two states, Karnataka and Rajasthan.||Anirudh Krishna,Eric Haglund

The struggle against terrorism requires us not only to keep our nerves but also to keep our heads. A far more productive approach would be bilateral, multilateral and United Nations-sanctioned diplomatic pressures on Pakistan to act on domestic terror groups.

On the average, individuals pay about twice the official amount to obtain a licence and very few take the legally required driving test, resulting in many unqualified yet licenced drivers. The magnitude of distortions in the allocation of licences increases with citizens' willingness to pay for licences. These results support the view that corruption does not merely reflect transfers from citizens to bureaucrats but that it distorts allocation. The paper also shows that partial anti-corruption measures have only a limited impact because players in this system adapt to the new environment. Specifically, a ban on agents at one regional transport office is associated with a high percentage of unqualified drivers overcoming the residency requirement and obtaining licences at other RTOS.||Marianne Bertrand,Simeon Djankov,Rema Hanna,Sendhil Mullainathan

While many of the recommendations have merit, the broad approach to reduce regulatory costs, overlaps, silos and gaps appears to be characterised by "melting the pot" to create a homogeneous financial system. This runs the risk of putting financial stability to strain, as also of enhancing institutional and market inefficiencies.

This paper looks at the methodological background of fiscal transfers followed by recent finance commissions, particularly the Twelfth Finance Commission. It is noted that in India, there is long- term stability in the share of states after transfers in the combined centre and state revenues. This stability depends on linking the share of states in the transfers, particularly tax devolution, with the difference in the buoyancies of central and state taxes. In the context of horizontal imbalance, it is argued that some of the recent finance commissions have implicitly followed an axiomatic approach to tax devolution and brought in some normative elements in determining grants. In spite of large differences in fiscal capacities, a high degree of equalisation has been achieved. It is shown that for TFC recommended transfers, nearly 88 per cent of the needed equalisation was achieved while devoting 50 per cent of transfers to resolving vertical imbalance. A methodology is also developed to determine the weights of the vertical and equalising components of transfers through devolution.||C. Rangarajan,D. K. Srivastava

What have been the employment effects of this growth? And to what extent have these effects been conditioned by the institutional reforms? The paper focuses on the period 1990-2005. Rapid economic growth was indeed associated with a high-speed increase in productive employment. Surplus labour declined substantially; many workers moved from lower-productivity to higher-productivity jobs and labour-incomes increased in all types of employment. However, there have been some negative developments too. In particular, given that the formal sector had inherited substantial stocks of surplus labour from the past, economic restructuring and labour market reforms resulted in declining formal employment and growing urban unemployment for a period.||Ajit K.

By any criterion – number of accounts, amount of loans, credit in agriculture, banking across socio-economic groups, and rural and urban areas – women remain far more disadvantaged than men. In recent times, there has, in fact, been a worsening of access to banking services for women from rural areas and those from economically backward regions and social groups.||Pallavi Chavan

Inevitably this conception of "innocent" masses and non-comprehension of radical mobilisation explain the surprise at the Maoist victory in Nepal.

Based on a field survey in the four states of Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Orissa, this paper studies the own revenue effort of rural local bodies within their statutorily defined revenue rights. The study finds that the assigned tax rights are not fully utilised by the panchayats and non-tax revenue is the dominant source of their own revenue. A comparison of own revenues of the panchayati raj institutions for 2005-06, based on the survey results with those reported by the Twelfth Finance Commission for 2002-03, shows a huge difference between the two sets in the case of per capita own tax in Madhya Pradesh and per capita own non-tax in Chhattisgarh.||Pratap Ranjan Jena,Manish Gupta

30/8/2008-5/9/2008||special articles||40278725||Chasing a Mirage: Water Harvesting and Artificial Recharge in Naturally Water-Scarce Regions||The analysis presented in this paper shows that in water-scarce regions of India, run-off harvesting does not offer any potential for groundwater recharge or improving water supplies at the basin scale. The issues are many: (1) Water harvesting in the "closed" basins have downstream negative hydrological impacts. (2) Due to high inter-annual variability in rainfall and therefore run-off, during drought years the water harvesting structures have become highly unreliable, whereas an attempt to capture run-off during wet years would remarkably increase the unit cost of harvesting water. (3) In closed basins, intensive water harvesting would lead to negative welfare outcomes due to high negative externalities at higher degrees of basin development. (4) Even at the local level, physical efficiency of water harvesting is likely to be poor, mainly due to groundwater-surface water interactions and the poor storage capacity of hard rock aquifers underlying most of the water-scarce regions. The artificial recharge systems in natural water-scarce areas in India are economically unviable. Also, the much talked about virtues such as promoting equity in access to water, social justice, water security for the poor, and realisation of greater economic value from the use of water, can be hardly achieved through water harvesting programmes in water-scarce regions, as practised today.||M.

Among the several factors behind this, two which stand out are the economic reforms of the early 1990s and the sharp increase in the savings rate following bank nationalisation in 1969. This outstanding aggregate growth, however, comes with growing inequality and (declining but still) unacceptably high poverty. It is argued that this is partly a consequence of globalisation and gives rise to novel policy dilemmas. The need is for multi-country coordination of policies of a kind that has little precedence.

Further, the government did not scrutinise the quantum of land demanded by the company, blundered by offering highly fertile land in Singur, and compounded its mistake by invoking the Land Acquisition Act, thereby compelling landowners to surrender their land at a low price. Its compensation formula was biased in favour of non-cultivating absentee landowners, and grossly unfair to the actual cultivators, bargadars and agricultural labourers, giving rise to concerted opposition from peasants and their supporters.||Nirmal Kumar Chandra

The fact that the female body is constantly under pressure to conform and mould into prescribed social and cultural roles brings into question the spaces that need to be protected as well rights that need to be claimed so that women's bodily integrity is respected. This paper highlights the struggles and spaces that Indian women have negotiated in their quest for empowerment.||Kanchan Mathur

The long-drawn nature of treatment and the highly infectious nature of the disease made the Sanatorium regimen effective and populär before antibiotics entered the scene. The Sanatorium was not just a hospital, it was a social world - isolated from the rest of society it created its own definition of "Community". Now it has faded from public memory. This paper revisits the Sanatorium in an effort to uncover and construct the social history of TB in India. The Union Mission Tuberculosis Sanatorium in Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh, provides the Site for this historical enquiry.||Sheela Prasad,B. Venkat Raju

Based on two compelling, though not fully comparable, case studies of Hyderabad and Mumbai, this article argues that both the union and State govemments are adopting city-centric growth strategies, following international trends, and that these have far-reaching social and spatial implications in terms of governance. The policy shift calls for a serious re-examination of intergovemmental responsibilities, functions and financial transfers in order to ensure that the larger social issues are included in city Strategie planning. In both cities, the ongoing processes are contentious and contradictory, providing a stark contrast to the smooth Vision Statements that convey an image of the quest for "development" as a consensual process.||Loraine Kennedy,Marie-Hélène Zérah

Examining some features of employment contracts of the regular wage/salary workers who account for 88 per cent of the organised sector workforce, it is shown that between 14 and 27 million of the 41.5 million workers in organised non-agriculture are perhaps better labelled as informal workers who are without access to a set of social security benefits, though they are located in the formal sector. An analysis of labour productivity in the organised-unorganised segments of broad industry groups for 1999-2000 and 2004-05 is followed by an examination of differences across the organised-unorganised divide in average daily earnings and in the poverty status of adult workers in non-agricultural activities for 2004-05.||K.

This phantom discourse does not merely disarticulate the real relations between neoliberal globalisation and the material realities it enters, transforms, or destroys. It also offers a mode of affiliation for its chief beneficiaries who are required to feel global in conditions that are a far cry from what that term supposedly denotes. What are some of the cultural factors that facilitate such a discourse being credible? What can we learn from some of the terms that have come into prominence in this context? The article is also concerned with the contradictions and tensions that mark the contemporary moment. It argues that hyperbole is not merely a feature of present discourse but also a Symptom of what ails it.||Lata Mani

Hence, a comprehensive measure of poverty must ideally take into account the performance of an individual across multiple dimensions. Vulnerability to poverty captures the likelihood of an entity falling into poverty, given the current status of the household. Unlike poverty, which describes the status of an entity at a point of time, vulnerability is predictive in nature. This study ranks 15 major states in terms of multidimensional poverty and vulnerability to multidimensional poverty at two time points in the 1990s. The results show that both multidimensional poverty and vulnerability provide additional insights for prescriptive policies.||Rosa A. Abraham,K. S. Kavi Kumar

In contrast to policy documents that discuss inclusive growth in loose terms, this paper makes an attempt to define the concept and aims to develop measures of inclusion. Given the methodological inadequacies of verifying a broad-based growth process in terms of mean- based averages of income and absolute- norm based measures of deprivation, the study proposes order- based averages for verifying the presence of broad- based growth and extent of inclusion of the poor in terms of the consumer expenditure distribution. In addition, to facilitate verification and comparison of both inter- and intra- group inclusion in a plural society, normalised measures with reference to both mainstream/overall and subgroup averages are worked out. The tentative estimates indicate that the growth process between 1993-94 and 2004-05 bypassed the majority and was not inclusive. At the national level, the inclusion coefficient is higher for the rural sector than for the urban. The association between median consumption and the inclusion coefficient across states is weak, which would also imply that there is no cross- sectional evidence to believe that growth in India has been inclusive.||M.

It can be both, a boon and a curse-depending on the circumstances two sides of the same coin. Nationalism tends to be negative when people confront each other along the lines of national divisions; it can be productive enough when social divisions and hostilities tend to be based on other identities, such as religion, community or ethnicity. Central to understanding the contingent variability of the role of nationalism is the need to see nationality as one identity among many that we all have.||Amartya Sen

Data reveal that for women, education and employment move in opposite directions, literacy among women workers is lower than literacy among non-working women and development is not closing the gender gap. The bulk of women "included" in development disproportionately constitute the unorganised workers; the latter are those in the unorganised sector plus those working in the formal sector as informal workers. Given such a macro context, the paper is sceptical of the feminist agenda of engendering development.||Padmini Swaminathan

The peace process does not seem to recognise the fact that since the two countries conducted their nuclear tests in 1998 there has been a war and a major military crisis, both prominently featuring nuclear threats. Nuclear denial in south Asia is not a symptom of inattention, or passivity in the face of an overwhelming problem. It is deliberate blindness to the contradiction between word and deed. India and Pakistan talk of peace while pouring scarce resources into developing their nuclear arsenals, the infrastructure for producing and using them, and doctrines aimed at fighting a nuclear war.||Zia Mian,M.

We estimate total migratory inflows of 14.5 million and outflows of 17.9 million, implying 3.4 million "missing" people. The paper also uncovers a substantial degree of regional variability. Flows were much larger along the western border, higher in cities and areas close to the border, and dependent heavily on the size of the "minority" religious group. The migratory flows also display a "relative replacement effect" with in-migrants moving to places that saw greater outmigration.||Prashant Bharadwaj,Asim Khwaja,Atif Mian

Many of the methods of Kosambi's analyses are substantially valid even 50 years later. Some need reconsideration either because of new evidence or because of new theories of explanation or because the overall perspectives of the past are today differently nuanced. Kosambi's intellectual perspectives and sensibilities were inevitably of his own times. Up to a point they carry traces of both the idealism and the dismissals ofthose times. He insistently asserted his autonomy from the clutches of contemporary orthodoxies, both of the Left and of the Right. The past was not to be used as a mechanism of political mobilisation as it has increasingly come to be among some in our time. The sources that inform us about the past have to be meticulously analysed and subjected to a rigorous methodology irrespective of their Status or the authority they command. Kosambi would undoubtedly have agreed that the advance of knowledge was dependent on a constant critiquing of existing explanations.||Romila Thapar

This paper shows that revenue mobilisation by rural local bodies is abysmally Iow. The assignment does not include any important revenue handles and the panchayats are not able to exploit properly even the only notable tax base assigned to them — the property tax. The paper argues that it is necessary to take a re-look at the tax powers of panchayats. It is also important to build administrative and enforcement capacity.

The preparation for the 2010 Commonwealth Games further provides the urban authorities with an opportune context to " clean up" the city from its slums.||Véronique Dupont

It shows how and to what extent some of the widely held ideas of the colonial era on environmental causation contributed to and, at the same time, shaped a kind of environmental awareness, which became a part of medico-social thinking in India. It also adds a new dimension to the thinking on malaria in colonial India by situating the environmental paradigm within a social and economic context. This links it to other issues of social significance, deepening our understanding of the response to the disease.||Sujata Mukherjee

Using time-use data, the analysis reveals that worsening public infrastructure affects market work with evident gender differentials. The results also suggest that the access to public infrastructure can lead to substitution effects in time allocation between unpaid work and market work. The broad conclusion is that public investment policy can redress intra-household inequalities in terms of labour supply decisions by supporting initiatives that reduce the allocation of time in non-market work.||Lekha S.

If the massive machinery of India's welfare State suffers under the demands of its own reservations System, Nepal will have to think carefully about its own infrastructural limitations when crafting its version of affirmative action. One of the biggest challenges will be balancing the prerogatives of federalism with policies of reservation, which by definition require a strong central infrastructure to provide for equitable recognition and distribution of benefits.||Townsend Middleton,Sara Shneiderman

While the traditional caste occupational structure has changed, this is less so among dalits in rural areas. Caste endogamy remains the norm. The study shows that casteism is powerfully embedded in the collective consciousness. The caste system is oppressive due to discrimination, exclusion, exploitation and untouchability, but at the same time it situates the dalits in the system as a collective identity. Their desire is to end all kinds of discrimination, oppression and exclusion, but not the caste system in its entirety. This is an instance of a deep-rooted intemalisation of a world view. This paper is based on interviews of 1,600 dalit respondents randomly selected in Amritsar and Jalandhar districts of Punjab.||Paramjit S. Judge,Gurpreet Bal

The findings should worry everyone. Despite high growth, more than three-fourths of Indians are poor and vulnerable with a level of consumption not more than twice the official poverty line. This proportion of the population which can be categorised as the "common people" is much higher among certain social groups, especially for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. There is also evidence to suggest that inequality is widening between the common people and the better-off sections of society.||Arjun Sengupta,K. P. Kannan,G. Raveendran

It also ranks states according to the proportionate values of the three effects with respect to the total change in electricity consumption. In this context, the paper proposes relying on the Divisia index rather than simple adding up methods. This analysis is based on secondary cross section data of the sectoral electricity consumption and sectoral output share for three benchmark years, 1990-91,1995-96 and 2000-01. In the study, large variations among the states have been found in the identified effects for the early 1990s and post 1990s.||Shrabani Mukherjee

Further, the efficiency of resource use has been high with a long-term incremental capital-output ratio of around 4, which is comparable to the best in the world. While private investment and corporate growth have been majorfactors in the recent growth upsurge, it is important to note that this period has also been marked by a relative decline in public investment.

There can be questions about how historians, including Kosambi, may have used coins as markers of sodo-economic change. But Kosambi's use of numismatics was such that historians can no longer ignore numismatic evidence for societal history. It was inevitable that some of the major findings of Kosambi would not stand the test of time. But the need to revisit his findings only demonstrates the value of his pioneering perspectives: we need to think differently and prepare a new agenda for examining material from the past — if necessary by turning current perspectives upside down.||B.

18/10/2008-24/10/2008||notes||40278079||Community Caretaking and Women Volunteer Teachers in Mumbai Slums||Despite increasing emphasis on civic participation in governance, how and why people participate in civil society and what meanings they ascribe to their actions have received scarce attention. Addressing the gap, this paper ethnographically investigates women's roles as volunteer teachers in their slum localities in Mumbai. Examining the meanings of their community based teaching roles, the paper illustrates that women interpreted their engagements as community caretaking, which was grounded in interpersonal relationships and a desire for social upliftment of the disadvantaged. Illuminating civic participation from the standpoint of disadvantaged women, it reveals women's citizenship action as a complex and negotiated process, intersected by class and gender constructs.||Anju Saigal

Focusing on two of them, this article shows that the extent of the violence was markedly different, and asks "why?".

A significant body of research has argued that the "reformed" Hindu Code was not only very far from offering equal rights to women, it in fact took away many existing, more liberal customary provisions available to women of different communities and castes. Guha also offers a stereotypical division of the social sciences into History, Sociology, Political Science, etc. A number of scholars – the feminists being the first – have breached the disciplinary boundaries in the social sciences that were established in the 19th century.

Discussions with the residents about their preference for living in a "Muslim area" revealed a strong effect of memories of violent events (ranging from the Partition riots to the Gujarat pogrom) in the construction of local urban space. By living in Zakir Nagar its residents felt that they had built a barricade against the religion-based violence and discrimination that had become part of their collective memory. However, how people experienced discrimination and the insecurities they felt were affected not only by their religious identity, but also by their age, class, and gender.||Nida Kirmani

Agricultural growth rates have however declined in the last decade or so, the reasons for which have been elaborated upon. A gradual movement towards unorganised labour has characterised working patterns in the state and the phenomenon is studied, along with the conditions of living. In this context, the new economic policy of the Left Front government is critiqued. It is suggested that a policy that favours inclusive growth with greater emphasis on small enterprises should be followed by the government if it wants to sustain the gains made and address the shortcomings in the state.||Ratan Khasnabis

It uses the monthly averages of the SENSEX and NIFTY to measure stock prices in April 1996-June 2006. For the same period, the month-end yields on 10-year government security and treasury bills (15-91 days) are used to measure long-term and short-term interest rates, respectively. The paper finds that there is a long-run relationship between interest rates and stock prices. Both long-term and short-term interest rates affect stock prices. The long-term interest rates are found to affect stock prices negatively, whereas short-term interest rates affect stock prices positively. In addition, the SENSEX is found to be more responsive to changes in interest rates than the NIFTY.||Chakradhara Panda

However, the poor and deteriorating quality of statistics seem to question the extent of the upswing. But the fact that growth has been underpinned by an unprecedented rise in the fixed investment to GÏP ratio cannot be denied. For the first time, consumer credit in a low interest rate regime has boosted the demand (sweetened by fiscal concessions) for consumer durables and housing. However, the deceleration in agriculture (particularly foodgrains) and a decline in the share of fixed investment in infrastructure and industry cast doubt prima fade on the optimism about the future.||R.

However, despite these changes, the sexual and reproductive health of women continues to be an area of concern. This paper examines the socio-cultural determinants to women's health in Rajasthan in the light of the National Family Health Survey-3 data as well as the current policies and programmes affecting women's health. It asserts that in the present context, women's bodies, health and sexuality are being grossly neglected and abused in Rajasthan and there is a dire need for reform in the state's attitude towards women's health needs.||Kanchan Mathur

These narratives with the same characters but much that is different bring to mind the Akira Kurosowa classic Rashomon which tells the story of a woman's rape and a man's murder from the point of view of four different narrators.

Must the emergence of the novel be seen as a radical break with the literary modes preceding it? Highlighting notions of both rupture and continuity, this paper attempts to trace the embeddedness of the Hindi novel in the multilingual Indo-Persianate literary culture that characterised north India, particularly the twin cities of Agra and Delhi, as well as the ruptures and radical changes in social and cultural sensibilities that it sought to both explore and anticipate. It focuses on Shrinivasdas' Pariksha Guru (The Tutelage of Thal, 1882), the first novel of note in Hindi, as it emerged from the merchant milieu of Delhi and its vicinity, juxtaposing it with Banarasidas Ardhakathanak (Half a Tale, 1641), an early modern merchant life-story set in Jaunpur and Agra. This draws attention to the recurring merchant milieu and the vulnerability of this Community in particular to the kinds of social changes entering its world.||Vasudha Dalmia

Going by the three important criteria of access to financial services, efficiency and provision of credit, it is unlikely that foreign banks can do more than what the Indian banking system can provide. Add to that the risks posed by larger operations by foreign banks and there is a case for revisiting the 2005 road map of the Reserve Bank of India which indicated that these banks may be able to expand their presence after 2009.||T.

The most positive consequence of industrialisation has been its contribution to absolute poverty reduction, especially in the coastal provinces. Much less clear is whether migration - mainly from west to east and driven by rural industrialisation - has contributed to poverty reduction in the interior. For, remittances have accrued mainly to the relatively well off rather than to the rural poor. More negatively, counties which were large exporters of labour have suffered a skill drain. However, the main adverse effect of rural industrialisation has been its exacerbation of spatial inequality, which has also resulted in a rise of inequalities in per capita GDP among China's counties.||Chris Bramall

Guided by the basic thesis about how social evolution occurs, he rejected the view that India had ever passed through a phase of slavery; rather it was the construction of caste society that happened here.

Two tests have been used to measure these deviations. The first is the statistical measure of risk premium defined as interest differentials between two countries (here India and the us) adjusted for expected depreciation of the exchange rate. A positive value of such a measure essentially means that higher interest rate differentials reflect a systematic risk, exchange rate risk being a part of it. The other is regression analysis using monthly data. The mean of the average of risk premium is found to be positive and statistically significant for government bonds across all maturities. However, in the regression analysis, there is evidence of risk premium only for government bonds with a 10-year maturity period. Overall, the results confirm the presence of a systematic risk associated with investments in India compared to those in the us.||Subhalakshmi Sircar

The opening offree trade in the region has led to countries in south Asia experiencing high trade costs due to inadequacy in trade and transport facilitation. South Asia's trade is constrained by poor infrastructure condition, congestion, high costs, and lengthy delays. These Problems are particularly severe at border crossings, many of which pose significant barriers to trade. This paper Supplements the findings of previous studies on this subject and reassesses the transaction costs for India's overland exports to Bangladesh. It finds that transaction costs of India'sexportsto Bangladesh have increased despite simplification of documentations at border. The paper concludes that the rent-seeking informal economy is very much deep-rooted and making the trade transaction expensive at border.||Prabir De,Buddhadeb Ghosh

In a panel data study for 16 Indian states for the period from 1978-79 to 2002-03, it is found that (a) the states are not converging to identical levels of per capita income in the steady-state; (b) once factors that affect steady-state levels of income are controlled for, the poor states grow faster on average than the rich ones; and (c) there is an increase in the dispersion of per capita incomes across states over time.

Some commentators have even gone so far as to warn against political pressure for financial inclusion in India. It is not exposure to subprime loans that is a problem; it is the loss on subprime related securities that explains the sheer magnitude of the present crisis. The evolution of the crisis shows that the world did not fully absorb all the lessons from the collapse of the hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management in 1998. When do episodes of financial stress have a measurable impact on the real economy? Over the past 30 years, 60% of the financial stress episodes that led to downturns were banking-related events.||T.

There are indeed vital lessons to be learnt by India from the us experience with "9/ 11", though not of the kind widely imagined. By stoking the anger of hand-picked guests and unsubtly suggesting where the direct responsibility for the Mumbai outrage lies, the electronic news media, in particular, have seemingly predetermined whatever strategic choices may be available to India.||Sukumar Muralidharan

These groups, living in miserable conditions in an otherwise prosperous state, have been asking for tribal status as they are placed at a disadvantage in the present caste-based reservation system. A number of suggestions have been made to the government to consider the anomalies in identifying and characterising these groups. Their condition is worsening, occasionally breaking out into open protest, the Meena-Gujjar conflict in Rajasthan being an example. The 27 per cent reservation to the Other Backward Classes is likely to intensify the demands of these communities.||Birinder Pal Singh

These adjustments are made on the basis of the revision in purchasing power parity estimates as part of the International Comparison Program exercise. Using the same ICP exercise, the Asian Development Bank claims an even higher estimate of the poor in Asia. A proper examination of the underlying database and the methodology for estimating poverty across countries suggests that though these estimates are better than the earlier ones, the assumptions behind the adjustments and the quality of data obtained from the ICP limit the usefulness of such an exercise for cross-country poverty comparisons. For India, both these estimates suggest severe underestimation in the official ntimbers on poverty.||Himanshu

Does his archaeology measure up to his history? The approach in this paper is to view the internal logic of his hypotheses in archaeology, and to ask if Kosambi did justice to the data available in his time. Did he present a sound data analysis that could be emulated, enlarged, or reworked? The answer has to be "no". Kosambi's site locations were not precise; he was not interested in the typology of stone tools; and his correlations of tool occurrences with sacred Sites, of the tribe with an absence of plough agriculture, and of iron technology with agricultural surpluses, were flawed. Perhaps Kosambi's archaeology does not measure up to his history because for him archaeology was only an extension of history. But in order to work with the entities of archaeology, typology and classification are indispensable: as indispensable as is the knowledge of an ancient language for the historian. Failure to engage in the grammar of these entities and an ignorance of site formation processes give rise to faulty generalisation.||Shereen Ratnagar

The distribution of international aid is an important case in point. This essay reasserts the importance of certain old-fashioned questions relating to international aid: what is the quantum of aid available in relation to the need for it? How may patterns of allocation, at both the dispensing and receiving ends of aid, be determined so as to take account of both poverty and inter-national inequality in the distribution of incomes? Can some simple and plausible rules of allocation be devised? If so, what correspondence does reality bear to such rules? The questions are addressed with the aid of some simple analytics relating to optimal budgetary intervention in the alleviation of poverty. The ideas discussed are clarified by means of data employed in elementary empirical illustrations.||S. Subramanian

It undertakes a state-level analysis of inequities in child health by employing the widely accepted measures of concentration curves and concentration indices. It finds that the poorer sections of the population are beleaguered with ill health whether in the quest for child survival or due to anxieties pertaining to child nutrition. Further, an attempt is made to comprehend the relationship between income inequality and health status in the Indian context. The analysis reveals that the degree of health inequalities escalates when the rising average income levels of the population are accompanied by rising income inequalities. The income-poor sections have different needs and therefore, planning and intervention necessitates an understanding of the sources of inequality and recognition of the vulnerable groups to arrive at efficient resource allocation and policy decisions.||William Joe,U.

There is no basis to conclude that the new set of purchasing power parity rates employed to generate the new poverty estimates are closer to the "truth". We can only conclude that they are differently distorted than the earlier ones. There is, however, a feasible alternative method that would place at its core an identification criterion for the poor based on elementary human capabilities. The careful coordination of household surveys and poverty line construction across countries so as to capture whether individuals have the resources necessary to achieve these capabilities can ensure enduring comparability of poverty estimates over time and space.||Sanjay G.

This paper tests for the hypothesis by distinguishing between non-timber forest produce for sale and for self- consumptions, using the National Sample Survey Organisation data for a sample of 78,000 households in Bihar, Kamataka, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. It finds that households collecting only for sale purposes are not likely to be income poor. They may collect because they have more secure property rights, greater access to forests and/or markets and may even be asset rich.||Kanchan Chopra,Purnamita Dasgupta

One major finding is that the growth performance of cooperatives determines the growth of other institutions - the master weavers, middle men and independent weavers. Well- performing cooperatives are the best safeguard for the handloom sector, as they protect the weaver and also provide a counterbalance to the master weaver. Competition from powerlooms is an obvious threat, but this can be countered if the sector produces high value, unique (brand value) products or medium value products which can be marketed locally or abroad, as distinct from powerloom products.||S.

Although, globalisation at one level has given some functional autonomy for efficiency gain and competition and to attract private capital, it has restricted the scope for independent sub-state level fiscal policy.

His theory was positivist, too, in keeping with his Vision of scientific Marxism, and if its strong universalism here produced a skewed interpretation that is now in all its essentials dead, he introduced a new and crucial critical dimension to Sanskrit studies.

Second, securing openness of the trading system, which would require going beyond completing the current Doha agenda in two ways: deepening rules in existing areas (especially Services) and developing rules in new areas (to deal with undervalued exchange rates, cartelisation of oil markets, investment restrictions and environmental protectionism).

However, there are questions about the quality of data thrown up by NFHS–3.

While supporting the hypothesis that large peasant castes in the north and north-west practised infantieide, non-marriage of men and polyandry as strategies to control family numbers in relation to available resources, this paper makes three arguments: one, that these strategies occurred together, two,that one needs to go beyond this explanation to understand why daughters were the dispensable ones and, three, that the number of sons wanted was by no means unlimited.||Ravinder Kaur

In the case of primary education the funds have been directed at programmes that show a track record of underutilisation. In agriculture too, the details reveal that allocations are not on directly productive activities. These covertly disguised allocations on "desirable" components of the budget suggest that there has been "learning" on the part of politicians and we need to watch out for a New Political Budget Cycle.||Mala Lalvani

It therefore seems inappropriate that such. estimates should be relied on heavily to determine global resource mobilisation targets and priorities for action for lengthy planning horizons. Consequently, an alternative planning and resource allocation framework that is flexible and learning-oriented is needed. In this note, we explore one important class of reasons for uncertainties concerning the validity of recent estimates of the intermediate or long-term cost of achieving global goals, which stem from the unknown nature of the "development production function" and its (dual) cost function.||Sanjay Reddy,Antoine Heuty

It is this failure that underlies the spurt in rural violence that has highlighted once again the issue of the poor's access to land, water and forests. It is gradually being recognised that further deterioration of economic, social and political conditions of the rural poor can neither be arrested nor reversed without a significant policy shift towards a comprehensive land reform programme.

Yet, a very small proportion of rural/ urban households actually make purchases of either rice or wheat from the PDS; an insignificant amount of consumption is met by ration shop purchases. The pattern is somewhat better for below the poverty line households with ration cards. What all this shows is that the issue is not universalisation but improved functioning, greater efficiency and BPL-friendliness of the PDS.||M. H. Suryanarayana

This paper reports the results of a survey of tradftional stove ownership and health among 2,400 households in rural Orissa. We find a very high incidence of respiratory illness. About one- third of the adults and half of the children in the survey had experienced symptoms of respiratory illness in the 30 days preceding the survey, with 10 per cent of adults and 20 per cent of children experiencing a serious cough. We find a high correlation between using a traditional stove and having symptoms of respiratory illness. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the high level of observed respiratory illness is due to other factors that also contribute to a household's decision to use a traditional stove, such as poverty, health preferences and the bargaining power of women in the household.||Esther Duflo,Michael Greenstone,Rema Hanna

Beggary laws have begun to demonstrate how the law may be made, continued, expanded and practised when the constituency affected by the laws are powerless - so rendered by the illegality that the law visits on them, the prejudice that poverty provokes, the distance between privilege and poverty, and the vanishing obligations of the State. The Bombay (Prevention of Begging) Act 1959, in particular, has led to the callous treatment ofthose who are "ostensibly poor" and in the denial of rights to them, thereby rendering itself unconstitutional.

It finds that locals are indifferent to the administrative jurisdiction of the forest in the course of their resource extraction activities. There is no quantitative evidence that they are exercising restraint while accessing and using locally governed forests. Collective rule violation appears to be common. The inhabitants are unaware about the long-term ecological implications of their actions. As a consequence, both van panchayat forests as well as the state-controlled forests have degraded badly over the years. Rising population pressure also seems to be undermining the efficacy or even the persistence of these age-old local institutions.||Rinki Sarkar

It appears that in a monetised, already famished, agrarian economy, during situations of subsistence crisis, interlinking of food and land markets has the potential to cause an exponentially high degree of disaster. The role of a universal public distribution system, which carries over food from a surplus to a deficit year, and insulates the food market, thus becomes paramount.||Debarshi Das

In terms of monthly data, each observation of a one- year change in inflation is the sum of 12 one-month changes. This suggests that better information about inflationary pressures can be obtained using point-on-point monthly changes. This requires seasonal adjustment. We apply standard seasonal adjustment procedures in order to obtain a point- on- point seasonally adjusted monthly time-series of inflation in India.

With many developing countries experiencing a rapid decline in fertility, there has been overwhelming optimism that a demographiobonus will take these countries to greater economic heights. At the same time, there are pessimists doubting the ability of these countries to take advantage of the demographic dividend. This paper looks at the concept critically in the context of India. It tries to empirically estimate the contribution of the age structure change to economic growth in the country through a two-stage least Square method. The empirical analysis clearly exhibits a powerful positive impact of the boom in the working age group population on economic growth. This is despite the fact that the educational achievements and health conditions of the people are far from desirable and employment creation is well belowthe required level.||K. S. James

The performance of these organisations on the financial front has been rather wanting. Several reasons - both internal and external - have often been cited for their unsatisfactory performance. One of the less researched areas has been the various taxes these organisations have to bear. This paper analyses the different levies on the operation of buses in a city and also attempts to compare these in different states in the country. It also compares the taxes levied on other modes of transport. The impact of these taxes on the total operating costs is brought out. It is concluded that the high rate of various taxes are one of the important reasons for the financial unviabiiity of public transport systems in India. Besides, as compared to other modes of transport, the levies on the public transport system are quite inequitable. The paper concludes by highlighting that the taxation regime for vehicles needs a total overhaul.||P. S. Kharola,G. Tiwari

This income deflation, brought about by the imposition of neoliberal policies, compressed demand and kept food and other commodity prices in check. But over the longer term, income deflation has undermined the very viability of peasant agriculture, adversely affecting supply.

Through the first wave of M&As (1990-95), the Indian corporate houses seem to have been bracing up to face foreign competition, while the second wave (since 1995) saw a significant involvement of multinational firms. The macroeconomic policy changes in India facilitated the third wave of merger movement since 2000–i e, overseas acquisitions by the Indian firms. A large number of mergers were between firms belonging to the same business groups and product lines with a view to increase their respective Controlling blocks and market power. The Performance of acquiring firms in 1990-2005 was relatively better as compared to that of the Indian private corporate manufacturing sector. However, this study does not find significant evidence of improvement in their Performance in terms of various parameters during the post-merger phase as compared to the pre-merger period. The study argues that it is not efficiency-related factors that influenced M&A activities in the Indian corporate sector. An appropriate competition policy needs to be designed so as to address the possible anti-trust implications of overseas mergers for India, as well as to deal with M&As among Indian enterprises.||P.

Yet, the market for solar energy remains small and uneconomic, confined as the system is to households in remote villages and delinked from the network of electricity grids. If provided a direct link to the electricity grids which are served by thermal power systems, solar power systems can achieve economies of scale and can ultimately provide for the larger market of demand for electricity in the country.||Deb Kumar Bose

Until 1903, medical men had little idea about the true nature of this disease, which spread rapidly in the wake of the opening up of communication by rail and road. British medical intervention against kala-azar succeeded only in 1919 with the introduction of the antimony treatment. Till then, and after, the powers that be failed to prevent and eradicate the disease, with a lack of qualified personnel, funds, treatment centres, sanitary measures and, above all, political will hampering whatever modest efforts were made.||Achintya Kumar Dutta

To induce foreign savings to finance current account deficits requires the interest rate in India to rise. When capital flows are associated with rising investment expenditure, economic growth is viewed as sustainable and foreign capital's willingness to share in the upside benefits through the acquisition of equity increases. To prevent the exchange rate appreciation associated with rising capital flows, the Reserve Bank of India has been accumulating foreign exchange reserves. This results in a rise in liquidity and a build-up of inflationary pressures. The RBI then resorts to sterilisation to mop up the excess liquidity in the financial system. This article discusses the implications of these processes for the financial system and the economy.||Errol D'Souza

As contradictions in the official narrative on terrorism and its protagonists become manifest, public confidence will inevitably be eroded.

One solution is to monitor investment banks and hedge funds and subject them to regulation while seeking an institutional solution that would protect the core of the financial structure, the banking system. The bail out implemented in the us and some of the west European countries has been forced to take a form that perhaps provides the basis for such a transformation.

It finds an increase in prices for commodities that have small market sizes and scarce deliverable supplies (mentha oil, wheat). In contrast, futures trading has led to a reduction in volatilities and aided better discovery for other commodities (soya oil, hessian).

Godaan presents a moving human document and social panorama but Six Acres considerably deepens the "referential" function of its own discourse by rewriting reference as "epistemic access" to the structures of domination. The novel of a tyrant and of a tyrannical system thus becomes the product of a complicit social ideology and discourse, encouraging scepticism about what is given.

This analysis is confined to persons who have reported being ill within 15 days of the survey but have not sought either public or private professional medical services. There are systematic variations in accessing healthcare between urban and rural areas, as well as between males and females in each sector. While in the rural areas, the demand for healthcare increases significantly with the education level of the head of the household, in the urban areas the evidence is mixed. Richer economic sections constitute a larger proportion of sick persons who do not access medical care, especially in urban areas. Paradoxically, among poor households, which cite financial reasons for not accessing healthcare, women are less likely to be discriminated in rural than in urban areas.||Anit N.

But when times changed, the NGOS found themselves adrift. Caught between an authoritarian government (that kept them under surveillance) and foreign sponsors, local organisations found little freedom of movement.

Of the one-third of sample households that were classif ied as BPL, nearly a quarter have been wrongly induded. Besides, 44 per cent of the households which should have been counted as BPL were wrongly exduded. However, one must consider the appropriateness of the selection criteria along with these large selection errors.||Reetika Khera

This issue gains importance due to an increase in household private expenditure on education and health services in recent years. This article estimates poverty ratios at the all India level and for the states in 2004-05 by including the minimum private expenditure on health and education. The estimated poverty ratios are substantially higher than the official poverty ratios.||S. Mahendra Dev,C. Ravi

But it has been re-engineered to severely reduce its usefulness as an instrument for public participation in decision-making. This article, written against the backdrop of proposals for a new coastal regulation zone notification, analyses the different characteristics of environmental regulations and the new environment policy, and shows how a new perspective facilitates speedy clearance of projects that affect people's livelihoods and the environment.||Manju Menon,Kanchi Kohli

In a fresh analysis, this paper, using household level data from the 48th and 59th rounds (1992 and 2003-04) of the NSSO, finds that (within the limitations of the data) more than 40 per cent of households in rural India do not own land, as much as 15 million acres is in ownership holdings of more than 20 acres, and inequality in ownership has worsened between 1992 and 2003-04.||Vikas Rawal

26/7/2008-1/8/2008||discussion||40277779||Fiscal Sustainability Analysis of Tamil Nadu||Fiscal sustainability is associated with the idea that governments can continue with the existing fiscal policies indefinitely and remain solvent. This article examines the fiscal sustainability of Tamil Nadu by looking at four major deficit indicators, viz, the revenue deficit, the primary revenue balance, the primary deficit and the gross fiscal gap using the Gregory-Hansen Cointegration test. It contends that if revenues and expenditures are both difference stationary and cointegrated, the fiscal stance is sustainable. Alternatively, if revenues and expenditures are difference stationary but not cointegrated, then the fiscal position is deemed to be unsustainable. Evidence for Tamil Nadu using annual data for 1971-2006 finds that when considered in real terms with the exception of the gross fiscal gap, the other three deficit indicators – the revenue deficit, the primary deficit and the primary revenue balance – are not sustainable.||Swati Raju

This essay, begins with a comparison of the two and then carries out a critical analysis of the second version. Whilst the draft covers almost all aspects of importance that concern tribal societies, what it lacks is the "tribal voice". Throughout its length runs the "we-they" distinction - the distinction of "givers" and "receivers". We hear the voice of bureaucrats, planners, and development specialists, which constitutes the dominant discourse on tribes. The article argues that the tribal issues should come more to the centre of our discussions in contemporary India than remaining at the margins, as is the case today.||Vinay Kumar Srivastava

As a remedial measure, zoning was introduced which prohibited mechanised fishing in the inshore waters and proscribed mechanised fishing during monsoons. This study presents a theoretical analysis of the measure and analyses the available data to comprehend its impact upon fisheries. It finds that zoning has had a positive impact upon the resource distribution pattems, but that it would offer only a short-term solution if the larger Problems are left unaddressed.||William Joe

Strangely, in what was supposed to be a balanced development round, the focus will be solely on these two areas even as the rest of the agenda has been kept out. The draft agreements are also skewed (once more) in favour of the advanced economies. India, in particular, will gain very little and lose considerably if it agrees to the proposals on the table. Why then has India gone along so far with the us and WTO demands? Is this too a result of Manmohan Singh's governmfent wanting to accommodate the interests of the country's new "good friend" George Bush?||

Without a plan to replace the region's reflexive reliance on exports to the United States with another economic driver, Asia too will be drawn into the economic and political maelstrom that now engulfs the American economy. Whether Asia's economies can chart a new course will determine their ability to ride out the present storm.||R. Taggart Murphy

It finds that while caste is not strongly associated with occupational mobility in general, it is certainly important for upward mobility though the extent of mobility is different among different castes. The maratha- kunbis and dalits are the greatest beneficiaries of upward mobility though there is a difference in the mode of their journey. The Other Backward Classes lag behind these two and some castes among them even show Stagnation as far as mobility is concemed.||Rajeshwari Deshpande,Suhas Palshikar

Alternative forms of treatment continue to flourish, whether by traditional healers or by Christian faith healers. Three modes of healing - the biomedical, the traditional and Christian faith healing - are examined in this paper. Each can be seen to cater for particular needs, and so long as present socio-economic conditions remain as they are in the tribal regions, and the public healthcare System exists as it does, it seems unlikely that there will be any significant change.||David Hardiman,Gauri Raje

In a parliamentary democracy, the obligations of constitutional morality are expected to be equally binding on the government and the opposition. In India, the same political party treats these obligations very differently when it is in office and when it is out of it. This has contributed greatly to the popular perception of our political system as being amoral.||Andre Béteille

Each country will need to experiment and find the configuration of institutions and conventions that will work best within its national conditions and that will meet the expectations of its population.

It could make a decisive break from the notion of ethnic homelands that owes so much to the colonial propensity of fixing tribes to their supposedly natural habitats.||Sanjib Baruah
