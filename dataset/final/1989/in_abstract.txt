While historically ownership and management of these resources rested with the state, governments' failure to preserve common property resources together with their excessive exploitation for development has led to serious degradation of the environment with the attendant ecological repercussions. Under peoples' participation as an alternative, the beneficiary/client groups are made responsive to the cost of preservation. Such a system makes development with preservation possible and renders the assumed trade-off between development and preservation non-operational.||Kanchan Chopra,Gopal K. Kadekodi,M. N. Murty

But what about the number of those who, above the poverty line to begin with, are pushed below it by a variety of forces, all endemic to the operation of the economic system, such as the destruction of traditional crafts and industries, large-scale displacement on account of development and defence projects, floods and droughts and sickness and closures in organised industry?||Bharat Dogra

Such norms for minor irrigation works are inherently underestimated. Their comparison with the corresponding norms for major and medium irrigation works give a misleading picture that minor irrigation is a less capital-using option for the Indian economy. Not only the capital saving argument but also the recurring costs argument appears to be tilted against minor irrigation. Thus the case for according priority to minor irrigation development in Indian water planning on grounds of cost economy is not well founded in facts.||B. D. Dhawan
27/5/1989- ||review of industry and management, may 1989||4394856||On Competitive Impulses and Public Enterprise Performance||On the basis of the case studies of successful public enterprises, it appears that one of the critical factors for their performance relates to their exposure to a competitive environment, as such an environment provides a powerful incentive as well as pressures and compulsions for effective and efficient functioning of public enterprises. The theme of this paper relates to the different ways in which it may be possible to create a competitive environment or substitutes and surrogates for competition in situations where it is not feasible to have competition in the conventional sense. Section I is concerned with how to create a competitive environment for public enterprises in the field of traded goods and services (mostly relating to agricultural, industrial and financial enterprises). Section II deals with the generation of competitive impulses through surrogates or substitutes for competition in the field of non-traded goods and services (mostly relating to enterprises in the field of socio-economic infrastructure like transport and communications, power and such other public utilities). Competitive impulses cannot have the desired result unless management is sensitive and responsive to such impulses; this theme of management culture is taken up in Section III. The concluding section makes some observations relating to the nature and characteristics of development strategy that is most effective in generating competitive impulses.||V. V. Bhatt

Being mutually exclusive they inevitably fail to achieve their respective goals. This article argues with specific reference to the Gumti River Project that the material well-being of humans and the preservation of ecological balance are inter-dependent phenomena and the two goals should be integrated into a single project.||Malabika Das Gupta
28/10/1989- ||review of women studies, november 1989||4395522||Rural Women, Poverty and Natural Resources: Sustenance, Sustainability and Struggle for Change||Women in poor rural households are burdened with a significant responsibility for family subsistence and are important, often the primary, and in many female-headed households the sole economic providers. However, their ability to fulfil this responsibility is significantly constrained by the limited (and declining) resources and means at their command-a constraint that stems not merely from their class position but also from gender. These gender inequities in access to resources take varying forms: intra-family differences in the distribution of basic necessities; women's systematically disadvantaged position in the labour market; their little access to the crucial means of production-land, and associated production technology; and the growing deterioration and privatisation of the country's common property resources on which the poor in general and women in particular, depend in substantial degree for sustenance. At the same time, the women are not always passive victims-many have reacted against their marginalisation and are today significant actors in grassroots initiatives for change. In particular, in response to a growing crisis of survival, poor peasant and tribal women have emerged in the forefront of many ecology initiatives. These initiatives, which have developed into movements in several areas, articulate a growing resistance to existing approaches to development, and call attention to the critical need for an alternative approach which is regenerative rather than destructive of nature-a necessary condition for its sustainability in the long run. Indeed, the perspectives and insights offered by such movements, and women as important participants in them, need to be an integral part of any attempt to chart out an alternative.||Bina Agarwal

This is the truth that the state does not want the people to realise and so it pits the interests of the tribals against those of the 'small' non-tribal landholders.||K. Balagopal

There are also tell-tale indications that its vulnerability on the external balance front is leading the government to water down its stand on the intellectual property rights question.||B. M.

30/9/1989- ||review of agriculture, september 1989||4395391||Large Dams: The Right Perspective||We cannot, on environmental grounds, say 'No' to large dams and reservoirs; nor can we, having regard to projections of demand and availability, accept the view that there is no need for such projects. We should certainly accord priority to the utilisation of the potential already created, the reclamation of the potential which has been lost through misuse, and a vast improvement in water management (including both economy in use and recycling). We must encourage extensive local water-harvesting, and undertake re-greening and other measures to retard the rate of run-off and improve the retention of water in the ground. We should also place a much greater emphasis than in the past on minor irrigation, which calls for less immediate investment, promises quicker results, and presents fewer problems. Possibilities such as the use of seawater and the tapping of deep underground aquifers also need to be examined. However, we cannot rule out investment in at least some large-dam projects. Large and small projects, and the use of surface water and groundwater, have to be integral parts of an overall plan of land-use and water-use for a drainage basin or watercourse system as a whole. At the same time, considering the heavy costs (financial, human, social and environmental) involved in large-dam projects, we have to be highly selective and extremely cautious regarding approvals to such projects.||Ramaswamy R.

The role of major irrigation works based on big dams in particular is under serious scrutiny by environmentalists, soil conservationists and social and natural scientists.

This closing event of the march, reflecting the people's unfolding potential to resist dominant development concepts, was, however, broken up by an armed assault by the police.||Gabriele Dietrich

12/8/1989- ||special articles||4395210||American Forestry Professionalism in Third World: Some Preliminary Observations||The inflexible technical professionalism, arising out of the American forestry tradition's commitment to comprehensive, large-scale planning, is one of the prominent reasons for the failure of international forestry projects, particularly in developing countries. Rigid adherence to the fundamental tenets of professional forestry-technical expertise, marco-level planning, promotion of commercial fibre production, and a narrowly biological perception of forestry-has led to a blinkered world-view that ignores relevant social factors. This paper pleads for a re-evaluation of this tradition as a precondition for the success of forest development projects.||Louise P. Fortmann,Sally K. Fairfax
