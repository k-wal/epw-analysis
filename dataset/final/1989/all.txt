It also analyses the efforts made by the state-owned ITI towards absorbing imported technology and developing local capabilities. The analysis shows that successive imports have been effected at a high cost and its subsequent assimilation has been extremely tardy with the result that technological dependence in the industry has been extremely high. Though the industry has one of the highest research intensities, much of the R and D effort has gone towards adaptation of the inappropriate technologies that have been imported. The country has moved across the technological frontier but this has been done without properly absorbing previously imported technologies. Development of local capabilities consistent with the usage pattern existing in the country has received serious attention only with the creation of C-DOT.||Sunil Mani

And now progress in other areas is also threatening to slow down precisely because French women continue to fail to address themselves to the political determinants of their status. The link between politics and progressive social measures in favour of women is brought out by the authors' discussion of the impact of the women's movement, the pace of legislative reform bearing on women's status and women's importance as a factor in the country's political life in different periods of recent French history.||Christiane Hurtig,Janine Mossuz-Lavau,Mariette Sineau

Communal politics in Bengal has been generally studied from the standpoint of land relations as an expression of land politics. This approach, while certainly not invalid, only partially explains the problem of communalism in Bengal. Communal differentiation as rooted in the realm of cultural identity remains still an autonomous reality which needs to be taken into account particularly in dealing with issues like education. Against this background, this paper deals with the communal tensions generated by the introduction of the Bengal Secondary Education Bill, 1940, in the Bengal legislative assembly during the period of provincial autonomy.||Poromesh Acharya

A detailed examination of the definitions used and the estimates obtained reveal that certain Indian censuses and NSS rounds had a better enumeration of women workers than others. Taking the comparable censuses/NSS rounds over the period 1961 to 1983, the widely alleged decline in female participation rates is seen to be not substantiated. The recent decades also show a shift in the workforce away from agriculture and a trend towards increasing casualisation of the workforce in the rural areas.||Jeemol Unni

In discussions of fuel, dung-cakes are dismissed as an inappropriate use of potential fertiliser; in discussions of fertiliser, the work of transforming dung into manure is usually ignored; and in discussions of women's work, dung-work is rarely made a central focus.

Two alternative kinds of exemption limit are examined, viz, the actual exemption limit and the notional exemption limit, where the latter is defined to be the income level at which the marginal rate of 25 per cent becomes applicable. Norms for both the actual and notional exemption limits are devised using a determinants analysis on the basis of per capita income and the share of personal income tax in total revenue. It is seen that the actual exemption limit and the marginal tax rates at low levels of income are high in India, Pakistan, Jamaica and Spain and low in the US and Thailand.||Pulin B. Nayak,Pawan K.

In shallow financial markets, full liberalisation does not appear to be the first best policy. Until the non-bank capital market develops and functions effectively and substantial progress is made in regard to structural adjustments in trade, industry and the legal system underlying the financial system as a whole, a second best policy may be to have a diminishing degree of government intervention in the financial markets spread over a period of time, deriving guidance from market-related indicators.||Yoon Je Cho,Deena Khatkhate

This essay discusses the more seemingly 'creative' inventions of tradition that have been implemented by our artists, directors and 'experts' in the Indian theatre.

Prevention is aided by caring and curing which are the processes by which prevention is initiated. This paper, based on a study in a village in Ferozepur district of southern Punjab, shows the necessity in rural preventive health care of focusing on young mothers and on households in which they live. Constant visiting of individual homes was found to be important even when no treatment was required if only to assure the daughter-in-law that one was willing to be a part of her world and a friend if she wished it so. Once the young women had the confidence, faith and trust to listen, further steps beyond caring were removing dependency and, beyond that still, trying to interest them in each other's problems, eventually to reach a stage where they are not afraid to demonstrate that interest.||Joyce Pettigrew

The paper is divided into three parts. In Section I the author sets out the broader possibilities of interaction of technology and tenancy structure. In Section II, an attempt is made to analyse the impact of technological changes on lease patterns and tenurial conditions on the basis of field data collected from two technologically heterogeneous regions of the Punjab. Section III deals with the questions of mode of production and future prospects of tenancy. It is argued that the nature of tenancy relations is different under different technological conditions and tenants in developed areas, in general, are capitalist tenants. The study concludes that, in the peculiar conditions of industrial development in India where land is still the mainstay of a large majority of people, there is little likelihood for further decline in area under tenancy.||Iqbal Singh

The one-year field survey, covering 153 villages in all, was carried out in 1972-73, that is, during the expansionary phase of labour absorption in Haryana agriculture. The findings deal with the demand for women workers in field crop operations and the supply behaviour of cultivating and landless agricultural labour households. Data relating to the occupational structure of female members of cultivating and landless agricultural labour households are examined and an account is given of the seasonal occupational shift phenomenon, a dominant feature of the annual cycle of employment among landless women which has been very little discussed in the literature on the impact of the 'Green Revolution' on women's work. The paper concludes with some speculations about what may have happened in the period after the mid-seventies which was characterised, among other things, by a decline in per hectare labour absorption in the cases of most crops.||Sheila Bhalla

To test the law empirically, not only the value categories are to be translated in terms of prices, but one has also to extend the investigation from the level of national accounts to that of company accounts which this paper does. The large companies of India have not experienced any secular decline in the rate of profit, although they might have seen cyclical variations. The explanation for the steady trend lies in the falling share of wages and salary in value added, which also indicates the existence of objective ground for class conflict. The government takes away about one-half of the industrial output in the shape of interest, and direct and indirect taxes.||Ranjit Sau

The main purpose of this survey was to collect information on wage-earnings and other benefits received by different categories of workers engaged in small-scale manufacturing enterprises producing diversified products. A sample of 316 enterprises and about 2,162 hired workers engaged in these enterprises was taken. The sample was drawn in the form of interpenetrating sub-samples which facilitated calculation of standard errors, by using a properly designed sampling scheme from a list of units registered with the State Directorate of Small-Scale Industries. The data collected in this survey, permits estimation of not only the distribution and average earnings of hired workers by industry groups but also makes it possible to analyse variation in income across occupation categories and to examine influence on income of such factors like the level of education, skill, tenure of employment, size of the unit and so on. The information brings out very clearly the dismal condition of the workers in this sector.||Bina Roy,Robin Mukherjee

A vigorous drive is on to locate a new tax to compensate the urban local bodies for the loss of octroi revenue. Tax supplements to sales tax in the form of entry tax and surcharge/additional sales tax have been employed as a substitute measure to restore local fiscal balance in the absence of octroi. The present study evaluates these tax supplements in terms of their impact on resource allocation, equity, and local fiscal autonomy. Surcharge/additional sales tax has been argued to be better than entry tax. However, these taxes being state levies are found to be contradictory to the objective of local fiscal autonomy.||Shyam Nath,Tapas Kumar Sen

The literature, and the model underlying it, is critically examined here. It is argued that the decisions the researcher makes-on measuring variability, for example-must be based on his a priori belief of the underlying system. While much of the literature finds no adverse impact of variability on trade in the developed countries, the increased variability of exchange rates over time, as well as other unmeasured effects may well provide different results in future studies of this kind.||Rohinton Medhora

The analysis by agro-ecologic zones points to a significant pattern: that the incidence of both female wage labour and women cultivators is positively associated with high productivity (irrigated conditions) in paddy-growing areas and low productivity (rain-fed conditions) in wheat-growing and coarse grain areas. Arguably the most alarming trend is that whereas women's dependence on agricultural wage labour is higher and increasing faster than men's, the demand for female labour has not increased and may even have decreased over the past two decades. In the second section of the paper, the author presents the specific roles and needs of landless and landpoor women and recommends policy interventions appropriate to addressing these needs. In the concluding section, types of research studies which could serve to help focus the attention of the agricultural establishment and national policy makers on women as legitimate clients for agricultural research and extension are suggested.||Martha A.

While historically ownership and management of these resources rested with the state, governments' failure to preserve common property resources together with their excessive exploitation for development has led to serious degradation of the environment with the attendant ecological repercussions. Under peoples' participation as an alternative, the beneficiary/client groups are made responsive to the cost of preservation. Such a system makes development with preservation possible and renders the assumed trade-off between development and preservation non-operational.||Kanchan Chopra,Gopal K. Kadekodi,M. N. Murty

The yield levels of some crops have experienced phenomenal rise, thereby accelerating the growth of agricultural output in states where these crops constitute an important component of the cropping pattern. Whereas to begin with, during 1962-65 to 1970-73, the green revolution was confined to only a few northwestern states, it seems to have gradually extended to many other parts of India during the seventies, though this extension is still much too narrowly confined. This paper seeks to study the spatial pattern of agricultural growth in the country, taking 19 major crops which account for 82 to 90 per cent of both area and value of output in the different states. Also discussed are the changes in male agricultural worker productivity.||G. S. Bhalla,D. S. Tyagi

This paper is not a quantitative assessment of poor beneficiaries' cost-benefits, but rather a qualitative account of the type of people, largely drawn from the rich peasantry, interested in becoming milk society presidents, their successes with the administration in this regard, and how they managed their milk societies. The fieldwork conducted in twenty villages in two blocks of central Tamil Nadu during 1985 and 1986 suggests that the type of person who became a milk president was an important factor in the programme's overall profitability for the actual, especially poor, beneficiaries.||Rita Gebert

It attempts to explicate the presuppositions or foundations of social change. It has been found that the majority of theories of social change do not address themselves to the foundations of social change. They are ignorant about their own presuppositions. As a result most of them have become theoretically lopsided and the concept of social change has been identified by certain fixed patterns. These different theories conceive change in mechanistic terms, i e, change is something that can be brought about by external agencies. That there are internal agencies of change has not been properly recognised in most of the cases. One of the major aims of this paper is to argue that notions like 'change' and 'development' as understood in the descriptive theory of social change, are essentially linked up with a positivist conception of science and scientific method. The paper makes a critical assessment of the positivist foundation of social change. Given this objective the present inquiry assumes the following argument-structure. The first stage of our inquiry is devoted to the methodological issues concerning social change. At the second stage we have tried to explicate the meaning of social change. On the basis of our explication we have tried to show the built-in shortcomings of a descriptive or mechanistic model and argued in favour of a comprehensive model of social change that leads to the concept of development as a key to the understanding of social change. At the final stage we have analysed the meaning of the term 'development' and have tried to show that a theory of social change is not just a description of change but that it should also be a judgment of change.||Amitabha Das Gupta

What is needed is a different approach based on the country's relative strengths as well as the available options. For, from the user's angle, the benefits of developments in information technology are far too valuable to be missed, while from the manufacturer's angle, the stakes of meaningful participation in global information technology trade are high. It is necessary to evolve suitable late-comer strategies after carefully weighing the available options. This paper attempts to review the late-comer options available to India, taking into account not merely the structure of the domestic computer industry as it has evolved in recent times but also the ineluctable international linkages of the information technology industry which would render vertical integration and import substitution neither feasible nor necessary. Our relative strengths and weaknesses are discussed in a comparative perspective, against the strategies followed by the successful late-comers of the Pacific rim.||Sudha Mahalingam

As for the trend in the extent and magnitude of diversification, this increased only marginally or at most moderately during 1975-76 to 1980-81. Companies tend to diversify into activities related to their main activity. The industry of classification of a company undertaking diversification has long-term growth and profitability rates not greater than the all-industry level. High growth and profitability rates are observed in the industries into which diversification has taken place. The age of a company is found to be positively associated with diversification.

Two significant new factors have in addition marked the current demonstrations: first, the population of Beijing has supported the students; and second, the demonstrations have been semi-political in that the students seem to think that a fundamental change in education cannot come about without a change in the government and perhaps even in the system.||

The government itself branded the strike as a 'political strike' and used it as a justification for the declaration of Emergency. Such analyses, however, are indicative of an attitude which sees little importance in workers' own motivations and which sees 'politics' as the preserve of the powerful. This paper seeks to show that to understand the events of May 1974 one must regard the railway workers not as objects of a political game but as conscious agents of their own interests. Although its political implications must be understood, the origins of the railway strike must be located within the railway workers' movement and in the affairs of the workers themselves. It is argued, firstly, that the strike was the result of grievances that had built up over two decades and, secondly, that the grievances had been poorly addressed because of the nature of the trade union movement in the railways. The paper concludes that the developments which led to the railway strike exemplify the predicament of the whole labour movement in India.||Stephen Sherlock

This paper argues that this supposition is unwarranted, that the way Marx conceived of socialism or a socialist society is exactly the opposite of what passes for 'socialism' among most of its defenders and opponents and that, consequently, the question of 'crisis' of socialism in the sense of Marx simply does not arise.||Paresh Chattopadhyay

Such norms for minor irrigation works are inherently underestimated. Their comparison with the corresponding norms for major and medium irrigation works give a misleading picture that minor irrigation is a less capital-using option for the Indian economy. Not only the capital saving argument but also the recurring costs argument appears to be tilted against minor irrigation. Thus the case for according priority to minor irrigation development in Indian water planning on grounds of cost economy is not well founded in facts.||B. D. Dhawan

Different electoral regimes derive their legitimacy from different class reference groups and different balance of class forces. Power, it is argued here, creates its own legitimacy. Those who do not have power seek it and not legitimacy. Power, in turn, revolves around class interests and control over the state. Those who neither have power nor are able to defend their class interests do not necessarily consider authority legitimate or illegitimate. They may pursue private interests, illegitimate or legitimate activity or collective political action outside the institutional framework of the political class.||James Petras

The events of the last few months have shown once again that the college teachers' movement, like many trade unions of white-collar workers, is reduced to being an economic pressure group.

Since the settlements were between unequals in political power, the juridical land-use categories grafted on common lands often became impositions. Also, the provisions of four interconnected acts that have a bearing on the subject are often mutually inconsistent. And the pre-eminence of the state in determining land-use is neither supported by principles of jurisprudence nor warranted by the commitment to help the landless.||Rita Brara

The main components of this process were, diversification into higher valued products and differentiation of weavers, leading to more complex forms of work organisation. The rapid growth of handloom factories and small-scale powerlooms bears witness to this. The paper attempts a survey of the second of these components, relational changes. The process in its most general form involved reduction of 'independent' weavers to 'dependence', that is, a progressive erosion of the right of possession over the final product. Two basic forms of dependence can be distinguished: contract for sale products tied to a particular merchant and contract for sale of labour. At the other end, there emerged a group of large producers, usually with interests in cloth trade. Pure commercial capital was thus becoming differentiated and weaker as a class. Regional differences in the strength and direction of the basic movement were considerable. The industry in the south, including Bombay-Deccan and Hyderabad, proved more progressive with greater stratification among producers while in the east and the north, merchants remained entrenched, collaborating or competing with large producers. The paper locates the preconditions for this divergence in the antecedent structures of handloom weaving in these regions.||Tirthankar Roy

But while the crossbreed cow is clearly a superior milch animal to the local breed and the local breed cow is fast becoming redundant for all categories of farmers, the fact that the bullocks cannot be dispensed with drives at least a few of the farmers to maintain bullocks. The losses from the bullocks are made up by the gains from the crossbreed cows. The landless, however, tend to maintain local breed cows even if it means far lower incomes since the investments and risks involved are smaller.||Uma Shankari

In the traditional literature on developed countries, the consensus was that large firm size and increasing concentration increased innovative activity only upto a point.

The writings on India, like on other developing countries, have mainly adopted a case-study approach to these questions, and have come up with insightful but as yet non-generalisable conclusions.||Sanjay Kathuria

A highly skewed land distribution, proletarianisation of sizeable sections of the rural population, widespread share-tenancy and interlocked factor markets are some of the more regressive features of the existing agrarian production relations that are supposed to not only inhibit the transition to a more progressive agriculture but also block even the 'trickle-down' of benefits to the rural poor of whatever little increase in farm production occurs in such a socio-economic milieu.

The trail led to a dramatic story of pre-colonial trade patterns, of a tribal community engaged in long-distance transport, of the destruction of this means of livelihood by economic changes consequent upon the establishment of British rule, of the stigmatisation of the group as a criminal tribe, of the confinement of families in a penal settlement, of the recruitment of the women for work in a tobacco factory, of their organisation in a trade union under communist auspices and of the final success of the employer in splitting the men from the women on a hierarchical basis.||Meena Radhakrishna

27/5/1989- ||review of industry and management, may 1989||4394856||On Competitive Impulses and Public Enterprise Performance||On the basis of the case studies of successful public enterprises, it appears that one of the critical factors for their performance relates to their exposure to a competitive environment, as such an environment provides a powerful incentive as well as pressures and compulsions for effective and efficient functioning of public enterprises. The theme of this paper relates to the different ways in which it may be possible to create a competitive environment or substitutes and surrogates for competition in situations where it is not feasible to have competition in the conventional sense. Section I is concerned with how to create a competitive environment for public enterprises in the field of traded goods and services (mostly relating to agricultural, industrial and financial enterprises). Section II deals with the generation of competitive impulses through surrogates or substitutes for competition in the field of non-traded goods and services (mostly relating to enterprises in the field of socio-economic infrastructure like transport and communications, power and such other public utilities). Competitive impulses cannot have the desired result unless management is sensitive and responsive to such impulses; this theme of management culture is taken up in Section III. The concluding section makes some observations relating to the nature and characteristics of development strategy that is most effective in generating competitive impulses.||V. V. Bhatt

There are similarities in opportunistic political alignments, in the predominance of such merchants in local government and social institutions, in predispositions to philanthropic display, and in the practice of lobbying the administration. There are dissimilarities in the finance of mercantile associations, in the development of bipartite negotiations with labour, in the degree of autoregulation administered through associations. But most strikingly, while law and order activities are rarely carried out by mercantile associations in India, they are routine and important functions of mercantile associations in Bangladesh and are thought to result from greater insecurity of property, contract and person.||Barbara Harriss

The evolution of both the structure of collective negotiations and the structure of textile unionism occurs simultaneously. Thus not only does the bargaining structure result from prior union-management negotiations and varying capital intensities within firms in an industry, but the type of unionism is transformed during these processes. Examining the opposing forces of the law in preserving the status quo in the form of the BIR Act and the role of the 1982 strike in breaking down the state-imposed industry-wide bargaining structure in the industry, it is observed that the strike was partially successful.||Debashish Bhattacherjee

These MOUs were supposed to outline the mutual obligations of the government and public enterprises. As of now, eleven public enterprises have signed MOUs with their respective administrative ministries and six more will be added to this list in the next round. It is fair to say, the policy of MOUs is one of the major initiatives of the government towards the public sector in India. Yet, there has been a certain degree of dissatisfaction, both within and outside the government, over the functioning of the MOU system as it has prevailed over the last two years. It was, therefore, decided that a thorough review and revamping of the system should be undertaken. While performance improvement requires action on several fronts, a proper system to evaluate public enterprise performance is a critical element of any such effort. This paper presents a procedure for fixing performance criteria in MOUs and evaluating the performance of a public enterprise based on these MOUs. The proposed system has been derived after examining the international experience in this regard. According to the available information, the proposed system appears to be the most successful. After discussing the conceptual aspects of a 'desirable' performance evaluation system, the paper examines the MOU of ONGC for illustrating the difference between the existing approach and the one proposed in this paper.||Prajapati Trivedi

The result is massive landless poverty and a significant constraint on non-agricultural growth. This is the contradiction which has emerged in the course of nearly three decades of agricultural growth in India which underscores the urgency of renewing or stepping up the efforts along three fronts: the redistribution of land and non-land assets to the rural landpoor for more self-employment; the organisation of the mostly casual wage-labourers in the sizeable informal sectors, in direct alliance with the 'exploitation-neutral' agents among students, intellectuals, social workers, school teachers and administrators; and stronger commitment to the provision of education, skill training and placement targeted for members of the landless labour families.||Kalpana Bardhan

28/10/1989- ||review of women studies, november 1989||4395522||Rural Women, Poverty and Natural Resources: Sustenance, Sustainability and Struggle for Change||Women in poor rural households are burdened with a significant responsibility for family subsistence and are important, often the primary, and in many female-headed households the sole economic providers. However, their ability to fulfil this responsibility is significantly constrained by the limited (and declining) resources and means at their command-a constraint that stems not merely from their class position but also from gender. These gender inequities in access to resources take varying forms: intra-family differences in the distribution of basic necessities; women's systematically disadvantaged position in the labour market; their little access to the crucial means of production-land, and associated production technology; and the growing deterioration and privatisation of the country's common property resources on which the poor in general and women in particular, depend in substantial degree for sustenance. At the same time, the women are not always passive victims-many have reacted against their marginalisation and are today significant actors in grassroots initiatives for change. In particular, in response to a growing crisis of survival, poor peasant and tribal women have emerged in the forefront of many ecology initiatives. These initiatives, which have developed into movements in several areas, articulate a growing resistance to existing approaches to development, and call attention to the critical need for an alternative approach which is regenerative rather than destructive of nature-a necessary condition for its sustainability in the long run. Indeed, the perspectives and insights offered by such movements, and women as important participants in them, need to be an integral part of any attempt to chart out an alternative.||Bina Agarwal

While they cannot wish away either the forces of modernisation or the reality of a world consisting of nation-states, they also need not remain wedded to the text-book model of the nation-state given to them. Several modifications and improvements on this model are possible and indeed necessary. Such modifications are already being undertaken by the old, established nation-states, albeit in the light of their own experience and purposes. The new states can ignore these developments only at their peril.||D. L. Sheth

This paper argues that while this was true during the first two decades, there has been an important change in this regard-the intelligentsia has become a member of the ruling coalition. Further, this class has not acquired the position of power through any struggle with the other two pre-existing ruling classes; it has been, the author argues, co-opted by the other two into the coalition.||Ashok Rudra

One move which has achieved varying degrees of success is the establishment of export processing zones (EPZs). By offering a suitable package of investment incentives to both foreign and domestic entrepreneurs for the setting up of export manufacturing plants within certain defined areas, it is hoped that overseas capital and technology can be attracted to accelerate economic growth and to promote exports. China's special economic zones (SEZs) are being developed with similar objectives in mind and are basically modelled after the EPZ system. They are set up as experimental laboratories to test new concepts and policies of development and to expedite the process of modernisation in China. As the export processing system is completely foreign to China, there is little material available with which to provide a clear picture to show how the system actually functions. Existing literature on the subject is largely confined to qualitative discussion of the feasibility and implications of adopting such a policy measure in the economic development of socialist China. This study of the Buji EPZ in Shenzhen attempts to provide some concrete examples to show how the Chinese EPZs are operated and to what extent they have fulfilled the tasks assigned to them by the Chinese government.||Sun Yonghong

The paper attempts to look into the nature of the bonded labour system during the British period and the different forms of attachment that have developed and characterise the labourer-employer relation in Thane at present and to understand the content and implications of dependence from the point of view of the labourer and the poor peasant on the basis of field experience in one of the talukas in the district.||Indra Munshi Saldanha

The work was original in that it sought to obtain the maxima and minima of a function from algebra and without using differential calculus. The project itself was nourished by the notion of algebra as a cultural metaphor, and it is on this count that it attracted the attention of the British algebraist Augustus de Morgan. The Treatise, when placed against the background of Ramchandra's stance vis-a-vis the colonial educational policy, clearly reveals the beginnings of a still nebulous anti-colonial politics, insofar as its professed objective is a mathematical revivification of an intrinisic but dormant algebraic predisposition of the Indian mind.||Dhruv Raina,S.

Depending on the measure used, somewhere between a third and more than a half of IRDP participants in the study villages were actually worse off as a result of their loans (or would have been in the absence of partial write-offs of their dues). This was principally due to higher prices paid by IRDP participants in the livestock markets, prices which were not compensated by higher quality of the animals purchased-in other words, to price discrimination.

The study period was confined to 1961-73. Capital markets have witnessed several changes in the recent past. Dilution of foreign equity by multinationals under FERA, liberalisation of industrial policy and incentives to NRI investments led to boom during the late seventies and subsequently, (and in particular) during 1985. The stock exchanges all over the country and in particular the Bombay Stock Exchange have been swiftly changing their profile to the new circumstances. Do all these changes also reflect a change in the conclusions of Mayya? This article attempts to reconsider the issue. The selected data covers the period 1970-71 to 1985-86. It is found that, in general, equities have failed to provide a hedge against inflation. Frozen investment channels were better in this respect. Further, a comparison of yield structure for debentures, government securities and equities confirms that there is a distortion in their risk-return relationship.||Malathy Prabhakaran

Since the end of the Emergency, and to an even clearer extent since the induction of the Rajiv Gandhi government, an entirely new chapter of co-existence between rival segments of power-holders at the centre and in the states seems to have begun. This paper discusses the changes in centre-state relations and their impact on Indian politics using the following periodisation: (1) the era of linguistic/cultural differentiation within a framework of unchallenged unity and integrity of the Indian state (1947-67); (2) the era of centralisation following the challenge from the states (1967-77); (3) an interregnum of attempts to redress the balance of influence in favour of the centre (1977-84); and (4) the era of coalition and co-existence between the centre and the states (from 1985).||T.

Deficits/surpluses that actually emerged as against those that were expected are analysed. A closer look is taken of tax revenue by comparing the actual growth rates of four major state taxes with the rates adopted by the Eighth Finance Commission. The methodology adopted by the Ninth Finance Commission is evaluated from the point of view of its responsibility of promoting resource mobilisation and economy in expenditure. Some approaches to building up an incentive/disincentive structure that would reward financial discipline and penalise profligacy are examined.||J. L. Bajaj,Renuka Viswanathan

It identifies cities with high or rising rates of labour absorption in the construction sector and differentiates them from cities with low or falling rates of such absorption. It then relates these differences to differences in city characteristics in terms of changes in the composition of workforce, population growth and so on. One major focus of the study is to analyse the gender differences in the pattern of labour use in the construction sector of urban India. An attempt is made to decompose the percentage changes in gender-specific labour use in construction into various component factors contributing to variations in such absorption across cities. The authors have tried to identify the relative importance of the extent of male-female substitution within the construction sector as such, as well as substitution between the construction sector as a whole and other sectors in terms of employment generation. Also analysed are the effects of changes in workforce participation rates, increases in the total workforce or in the population base of the cities which were categorised in the size Class I category in 1981.||Arup Mitra,Swapna Mukhopadhyay

The dispersion pattern of input subsidies has implications for incentive structures prevailing in the agricultural sectors of different states as well as efficiency (and consequently comparative advantage) in production of agricultural commodities across regions and states. The attempt is to present some results which can be significant in evolving a rational/desirable cropping pattern in different agro-climatic zones based on the principle of comparative advantage. The study covers four major inputs of modern agriculture-fertilisers, irrigation, electricity and credit. The concept of subsidy on these inputs is defined in a more economically meaningful sense, which differs significantly from the one generally delineated in government budgets. The study reveals that total input subsidy, averaged over seven years, 1980-81 to 1986-87, turns out to be about Rs 9,000 crore at all-India level. It is approximately 17 per cent of net value added in Indian agriculture. More than 70 per cent of total input subsidy is on irrigation through major and medium schemes. At state level, the share of Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab in total input subsidy comes to about one-third while they account for only one-fourth of all-India gross cropped area. Input subsidies as a percentage of state domestic product in agriculture averaged over 1980-81 to 1986-87, are highest for Tamil Nadu (31.7 per cent), followed by Punjab (24.5 per cent), Haryana (23 per cent), Andhra Pradesh (21.3 per cent) and Uttar Pradesh (18.2 per cent). At the bottom end are the states like Himachal Pradesh (2.0 per cent), Assam (2.4 per cent) and Jammu and Kashmir (5.4 per cent).||Ashok Gulati

Rapid growth has caused 'overheating' of the economy, manifested in imbalances and inflation. The attempt to introduce incentives is bringing back inequalities. Delegation of power to lower levels has tended to undermine the ability of the state to manage the economy at the macro-level. Permission to import freely has led to drain of foreign exchange apart from giving rise to fears of an onslaught of 'decadent bourgeois and feudal ideology' while the environment of permissiveness has bred corruption and bribery. Has Chinese economic reform, then, run out of steam? Will and can China go ahead with the reforms in their present form or with modifications or will it revert to the earlier system of centralised control?

It is argued that contrary to Nozick's thesis, there cannot logically be any historical theory of acquisition free of patterning. It is also argued that fairness cannot ordinarily be ensured in exchange transactions. Thus both the theories of justice in acquisition and exchange are seen to be seriously flawed. It is suggested that there is no choice but to resort to periodic patterning in terms of certain end-state theories of distribution. The Marxian notion of distribution given by 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs', is found to possess great merit precisely because it abandons the notion of distribution in terms of material goods altogether.||Pulin B.

Or, have Marx and Engels admitted the possibility of a peaceful transformation as well? What are the circumstances under which such peaceful transformation will take place, if at all? Is the violent or peaceful nature of the revolution rooted in the very structures of the capitalist society? If so, is it determined solely by the economic structures? Or, do political structures too have a role to play? Is this role independent of the economic structures? Do Marx and Engels accept subjective, conscious intervention in the process of the revolution? If this intervention is accepted, what effects does it have on the nature of the revolution in terms of making it violent or peaceful? What are the conditions under which this intervention is acceptable, and why? Finally, were there any differences between Marx and Engels on this issue? And, did Engels alter his views after the death of Marx?||Rustam Singh

This has been done along the lines of 'monetary approach to the BP', as developed by Johnson [1972], Mundell [1968] and others. A comparison is made between elasticity approach and monetary approach in solving the BP problem. The reserve flow and sterilisation equations are estimated and the direction of causation between domestic credit and foreign exchange reserves is identified with Granger and Sims causality tests. The paper is divided into five sections. For the sake of completeness a brief outline of monetary approach to BP (MBOP) is given in Section I. Section II explains money demand equation, estimation of reserve flow and sterilisation equations. On the basis of money demand equation, monetary disequilibrium factor is worked out and the impact of this on trade, service and capital flows of the BP is tested in Section III. Dynamic simulation and the resultant multipliers are explained in Section IV followed by policy implications of this exercise in Section V.||R. Kannan

The paper examines the pulses production at the disaggregate level, to ascertain the nature of stagnancy in pulses production and identifies some of the common features of states with similar patterns of production. The obvious stagnancy at all-India level is the net result of changing situation at the disaggregate level rather than an overall stagnancy. Two distinct patterns of pulses production seem to emerge for wet and dry areas. Judging from trends in rates of growth of area in cereals, oilseeds and pulses seasonwise, over the past twenty years, pulses seem to face adverse competition from cereals only in five states in the rabi season. About 75 per cent of the total pulses production, mostly in dry states, do not seem to face any adverse competition from the expansion of area under cereals.||Swarna Sadasivan

The sample reflects public and private sectors, family owned and professionally managed companies as well as Indian and multinational companies. Sixteen companies responded to a comprehensive structured questionnaire. The observations and conclusions seem to be compatible with the general state of the art as reflected in the numerous articles published in the area of long-range planning. The article also highlights the differences and nuances of corporate planning as currently practised in India within the framework of a basically regulated and controlled economy.

An explanation is offered for the furious reactions to Rushdie's novels, most especially to The Satanic Verses, in terms of the several discourse features of gossip that always attach to the fractious public themes in his text. Gossip, an underrated, conversational medium for private criticism is used anew by Rushdie as a devastating literary weapon against the claims of historical 'truth' and religious 'morality'.

While analysing the various policy options for India to become self-reliant in this crucial sector, it suggests that the main constraint for increasing oilseeds production in India is technology. It cautions against a strategy of laying sole emphasis on the price mechanism which can only be at the cost of coarse cereals, the main competitors of oilseeds and which are mostly consumed by people with low incomes.||K.

In the context of the working class it has been argued that workers have been equally, if not more, responsible for adding to the dynamics of communal politics. This view has been questioned by some scholars and the idea of 'levels of consciousness' has been introduced to explain the apparent ease with which workers participating in workers' struggles have broken into communal riots soon thereafter. This paper studies the 1893 communal riot in Bombay and argues that while the workers, the majority of them being Marathas, were involved in the riot on the Hindu side, this did not lead to the development of a long-term communal consciousness among them.||Shashi Bhushan Upadhyay

We should certainly accord priority to the utilisation of the potential already created, the reclamation of the potential which has been lost through misuse, and a vast improvement in water management (including both economy in use and recycling). We must encourage extensive local water-harvesting, and undertake re-greening and other measures to retard the rate of run-off and improve the retention of water in the ground. We should also place a much greater emphasis than in the past on minor irrigation, which calls for less immediate investment, promises quicker results, and presents fewer problems. Possibilities such as the use of seawater and the tapping of deep underground aquifers also need to be examined. However, we cannot rule out investment in at least some large-dam projects. Large and small projects, and the use of surface water and groundwater, have to be integral parts of an overall plan of land-use and water-use for a drainage basin or watercourse system as a whole. At the same time, considering the heavy costs (financial, human, social and environmental) involved in large-dam projects, we have to be highly selective and extremely cautious regarding approvals to such projects.||Ramaswamy R.

The person shown on the records as responsible for paying land-revenue for a particular piece of land is presumed to be the proprietor of that land unless it is proved otherwise. Thus title to land is only incidental. This paper argues why it is necessary to change over to a system of registration of title to land and discusses, on the basis of a review of the arrangements prevailing in a number of other countries, how such a system can be introduced in India.||D.

18/3/1989- ||special articles||4394529||The State, Religious Fundamentalism and Women: Trends in South Asia||The growth of state-sponsored religious fundamentalism is one of the crucial issues affecting women. Recent years have seen a shift away from even the liberal rhetoric of equal rights for women with the passing of laws withdrawing legal and political rights which women had already won. These trends, however, go along with government policies and programmes to integrate women into development. This apparent contradiction can be seen as two sides of the same imperative to control and direct women's labour, fertility and sexuality to suit both capitalist and patriarchal interests. This paper examines the basis for the emergence of fundamentalism and the implications of such a state ideology for the women's movement. It is argued that capitalist development in these countries, however distorted and uneven, has led to a weakening of traditional patriarchal controls over women especially within the family. Religious fundamentalism as a state ideology could provide a coincidence of capitalist and patriarchal interests.||Amrita Chhachhi

The commission's scheme is shown to be regressive because of a priori entitlement-based tax-sharing exacerbated by the commission's specific grants which are tilted toward middle- and high-income surplus states. The paper argues that the commission's approach to its main award for 1990-95 and its target of phasing out revenue deficits at all levels by 1994-95 are bound to adversely affect equity, welfare and growth. It then outlines the elements of an integrated normative approach to non-plan and plan financing in the states' revenue account.||S. Guhan

If income grows faster than employment then it tends to generate more demand for industrial goods vis-a-vis agricultural goods, and consequently the disparity between industrial and agricultural growth widens.||B.

At the same time in spite of their financial and technical limitations over the years the small growers have increased the area of their holdings and their productivity. This shows that the small growers have been more enterprising in raising production than the large estates whose production has remained stagnant. The co-operative factories have not only ensured fair prices to their members but also to growers in areas where there are no co-operatives. The bought leaf factories in these areas pay their growers the market prices. They are cautious in lowering prices as they know that this would provoke the growers into joining a co-operative or, when there is none, in forming a new one. Thus the impact of these co-operatives can be felt on all the small growers in this district.||V. N. Reddy,Sharit K. Bhowmik

This trend is, however, mainly limited to the larger landholders. In the early 1960s, agriculture was already commercialised and wage labour was used on a permanent basis, especially by Patidars and Anavils. These castes had been the peasant vanguard in the process of commercialisation during the 19th and early 20th century.

Its policies are the outcome of the pressures from the ruling interest groups-whether the organised sectors, agriculturists or foreign interests trying to enter the economy and sections of Indian business trying to keep them at bay. Government policies are constrained by these political realities and its capacity to utilise the economy's resources more rationally is limited in the process. The result is a vicious circle. Resources are wastefully utilised which increases social tensions and demands on the government and then feeds into more waste. The 1989-90 budget reflects the incapacity of the government (and the ruling classes it represents) to take the steps necessary to break out of the low growth trap the economy finds itself in. The fiscal crisis facing the government and limiting its capacity to intervene in the economy remains unchecked. Efforts at creating employment are too small in comparison to the needs. Little dent is likely to be made on raising resources through the taxation of services. Technology is unlikely to 'take off' to raise 'efficiency' or reduce costs to make Indian goods export competitive. The capital goods sector is likely to face greater difficulties.||Arun Kumar

13/5/1989- ||special articles||4394792||The Mirror of Class: Class Subjectivity and Politics in 19th Century Bengal||The political, social and cultural understanding of the Bengali middle classes originating in the terrain of colonial capital was shaped through practices and ideas that came from the bourgeois world of the west. The incoming discourse and practices originated in a mode of production, language and worldviews which were not only alien to Bengal but also at odds with it both in terms of power of assertion and contradiction within the existing social and cultural life. The work of the new classes lay in coping creatively with the new determining forces that impacted upon them. They developed a mode of doing and being, as the colonial era evolved, which provided them with a social physiognomy quite specific to themselves and distinct from other classes both in the city and country side. When we contrast the 19th century Bengali upper class society with its counterpart in 18th century Bengal, the rapidity in the reworking of the social and intellectual space seems astronomical. This was a matter both of choice and of need arising out of the actuality of colonialism, which was met both consciously and spontaneously. It illustrates the truth of Marx's statement that people make history, but not as they please.||Himani Bannerji

The major producing states are considered individually as well as on the aggregate. The analysis is conducted in two parts. The first part analyses growth from point-to-point in the 'peak' years of foodgrain production-1970-71, 1978-79 and 1983-84. The second part contrasts these results to the 'trough' years-1972-73 and 1979-80. The major conclusions suggested at the aggregate level are: (a) Output differences between peak and trough years are primarily due to variations in yields on unirrigated land. (b) Irrigated yield increases have been a substantial and increasing source of growth in both rice and wheat output, especially the former. (c) In the peak years, changes in the area components contributed more to growth in wheat than rice. The better quality of the incentive package available to wheat growers might be behind this development. However, in the trough years the area components accounted for a greater share in the growth of rice than wheat.||Deepak Ahluwalia

Further, decentralisation below the state level cannot be viewed in isolation from the larger issue of reordering relations between the centre and the states. Democratic decentralisation as an idea has gained wide acceptance. What has not been adequately recognised, however, is that the effective implementation of the idea requires major changes in the system of governance.
