An empirical analysis of the performance of the Lokayukta in Karnataka between 1995 and 2011 suggests that any anti-corruption agency, no matter how powerful, that is oriented towards criminal conviction is bound to fail in the absence of judicial reforms.||NARAYANA A,SUDHIR KRISHNASWAMY,VIKAS KUMAR

This paper critically reviews the evidence and finds that decollectivisation did not contribute to agricultural growth in the early 1980s. In particular, its response to Lin (1992) challenges the consensus and argues that decollectivisation was largely irrelevant to the exceptional growth in this period. It is held that a more intensive application of modern inputs and favourable weather conditions accounted for most of the spurt in growth.||ZHUN XU

Thus, the poor in the more remote blocks and villages may be ignored for easier to reach potential enrollees as the premia paid for all are the same. Empanelled hospitals tend to be placed near district headquarters, raising costs of access for the poor beyond that covered in the programme and packages do not recognise treatment and care uncertainties that incentivise hospitals to treat simpler and less complicated diseases. Additionally, a lack of adequate planning for change in insurance providers creates breaks in service that are avoidable. In spite of these shortcomings users rate this programme highly and this underlies the importance of providing access to a functional healthcare system to the poor.||PRATEEK RATHI,ARNAB MUKHERJI,GITA SEN

The authors suggest that if the performance of these credit cooperatives does not improve, a larger government role in the supply of credit may undermine the culture of repayment.||JORDI DE LA TORRE,XAVIER GINÉ,TARA VISHWANATH

The commercialisation of agriculture since the late 1960s has not only squeezed labour demand but has also limited it to peak periods of short duration.

We report four key findings. First, consistent with the fact that the decade was the best one for Indian macroeconomic performance, growth increased across almost all major states in 2001-09 compared to 1993-2001. Second, nevertheless, we continue to see the phenomenon of divergence or rising inequality across states: on average the richer states in 2001 grew faster in 2001-09. Third, during the crisis years of 2008 and 2009, states with the highest growth in 2001-07 suffered the largest deceleration. Since high growing states were also the most open, it seems that openness creates dynamism and vulnerability. Finally, although the demographic dividend -a young population boosting economic dynamism -was evident before 2000, there is little evidence that there was any dividend in the 2000s. Demography alone cannot be counted on for future economic growth.||UTSAV KUMAR,ARVIND SUBRAMANIAN

In particular, it focuses on young men who find themselves "in-between" in multiple senses: between youth and adulthood, the rich and poor, and the rural and urban. This "in-betweenness" shapes how they navigate a changing economic and institutional landscape.

Specifically, it is found that turnout rates as well as the number of contesting candidates declined sharply starting in 1993 and this trend continued till 2002 (the end point of the data studied). There is suggestive evidence that this trend-break coincided with a sharp uptick in the correlation between male and female rates of electoral participation. The formal devolution of powers to panchayati raj institutions starting in 1993 may explain these findings in the data.||A V CHARI,ANNEMIE MAERTENS

From the late 1960s onwards, the green revolution helped the sector maintain steady growth for more than two decades. But the challenges that swept through the economy in the 1990s after the initiation of economic reforms arrested this growth. Conscious efforts have brought about a recovery of growth since the middle of the first decade of the 2000s. It is important to assess whether the recent turnaround is sustainable in the long run.

While love between a man and a woman can acquire divine status, at the same time, sociocultural norms view it as rebellion and shame/loss of honour for the woman's family. Not all cases of love marriages end up in honour killings but a love affair is perceived as rebellion by the family and community in which the latter expects the former to save its honour.

The first aim of this paper is to provide grass-roots insights into the post-war status of the north Sri Lankan fishing population and how their recent recovery has added a new dimension to the Palk Bay conflict. The second purpose is to create a better understanding of the nature of this conflict and to analyse the relevance of existing and proposed governance responses. Contrary to popular perception in India, this paper argues that since the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka the nature of the conflict in the Palk Bay has changed from one in which Indian trawler fishermen were faced with the Sri Lankan navy, to one which sets them primarily in opposition to the technologically less advanced Sri Lankan fishermen. It concludes that the governmental and fisher-based efforts to settle the conflict are ineffective as long as Indian parties do not acknowledge the nature of the conflict and the Sri Lankan authorities do not bring the fishermen and their government closer together.||J SCHOLTENS,M BAVINCK,A S SOOSAI

The primary motivation of this paper is to investigate the structure of wage inequality and employment in India with the 61st round (2004-05) household survey on employment and unemployment conducted by the National Sample Survey Office. The study measures comprehensively different dimensions of wage inequality as observed in the Indian labour market by using the Gini inequality index. In analysing the structure of wage inequality it considers three major sectors, the public, private formal and informal sectors. Wage inequality in the private formal sector is higher than the inequality even in the informal sector. Wage differentials in India are higher in rural as compared to urban areas, and are higher among women than among men workers. Simple decompositions of wage inequality by sectors reveal that a significant part of wage inequality is accounted for by inequality among individuals between rather than within sectors for every type of working person.||PANCHANAN DAS

The phenomenon is more prevalent in rural areas of the country's northern and eastern states. This paper also examines the association between temporary migration and its determining factors, particularly economic status, landholding and educational levels. It observes that there is a significant negative association between economic and educational attainment and temporary migration, both in rural and urban areas. In general, socio-economically deprived groups such as adivasis and those from the lower castes have a greater propensity to migrate seasonally, which also reflects its distress-driven nature.||KUNAL KESHRI,R B BHAGAT

AnRak Aluminium, a company of the government of Ras al-Khaimah of the United Arab Emirates and Penna Cement of ap has secured approval for both an aluminium complex and the bauxite mines, but the final forest clearance for the mines is awaited. The AnRak project has replicated the Vedanta model of first building the refinery and then setting up the mine. The mine is to be operated by the state government to circumvent the ban on non-tribal landownership. In fact, the state government has disregarded the huge environmental and social impact and popular protests against mining bauxite in the Jerrela Hills, inhabited almost exclusively by adivasi tribes who will be displaced, to safeguard private gain.||PATRIK OSKARSSON

This results in a split between leaders and the rank and file — a tendency which often leads to the betrayal of the interests of the struggling workers. This propensity of isolation of the rank and file in workers' struggles is a product of the complex process whereby the trade union form of politics has been integrated within the legal apparatus of the bourgeoisie-friendly state.||MAYA JOHN

The Census of India is the only source providing useful demographic information at the district and administrative levels below it. The findings of this study indicate that India is undergoing a fertility transition, yet around one-third of districts have a birth rate of 25 or more. High fertility districts have shown a faster pace of decline. Furthermore, around a quarter of the districts are characterised by a very low implied sex ratio at birth, of less than 900. Spatial analysis reveals a contiguous pattern of low ratios in the north-western part of the country and emerging pockets in Maharashtra and Gujarat followed by Orissa.||SANJAY KUMAR,K M SATHYANARAYANA

The authors also draw on experiences from other countries, to argue that GRB in India needs a completely different rhythm if it has to translate into better outcomes for the women of our country. With the formulation of the Twelfth Plan under way, the moment is opportune to push for groundbreaking changes in the policy discourse on GRB.||YAMINI MISHRA,NAVANITA SINHA

Such flexible governing has allowed state authorities to negotiate grass-roots opposition and mobilisation, modify the project to gentrify the riverfront further, and even officially represent the project as inclusive although questions of social justice have been profoundly disregarded over the past decade and continue to be insufficiently addressed.

Analysing the growth rates in assets of some politicians in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, it finds that they are much higher than the market growth rate.

It is argued that Hitler and his manifesto are now evoked in India and elsewhere in fractured and dispersed ways that elide their ideological significance.

It is in fact a selective interpretation because it glosses over the fact that the military actually has a considerable amount of say on matters pertaining to national security. And it is an incomplete interpretation because the problematic nature of civil-military relations in India cannot be reduced to institutional dynamics within the government.

Some Aspects of Education in 19th Century Assam||The unique trajectory of colonial education in Assam in the 19th century forms the subject matter of this paper which argues that the state took a conscious decision to promote education till the upper secondary level at the cost of higher collegiate education. Throughout the 19th century the state argued against the setting up of a college in the province and encouraged Assamese students to travel to Calcutta for higher education. Through an examination of the revenue records, the paper shows that this departure from the colonial state's overall policy was uniquely designed to cater to the revenue needs of the state in a region unusually constrained on account of the deficit of labour. The palpable disregard for higher education by the administration was, however, sought to be justified by harping on the backwardness of the Assamese mind, and the consequent need for exposure to the intellectual environment of Bengal.||MADHUMITA SENGUPTA

In particular, little is known about the bias resulting from non-response due to the respondent's incapacity to answer the questions. This paper attempts an assessment of the prevalence of such non-response errors across different categories of respondents. It evaluates the impact of these errors on estimation of monthly per capita consumption expenditure, using data from the 61st round of the National Sample Survey. Finally, it suggests alternative estimates for consumption expenditure as well as headcount ratios for poverty for selected major states, derived after eliminating the effect of non-response. The reliability of such estimates is also reported.||SILADITYA CHAUDHURI,AMITAVA SAHA

Political Economy of Hydropower in the Eastern Himalayas||The large dams being built on the rivers of the eastern Himalayas have become highly controversial. The hydropower that north-east India is expected to produce is meant almost entirely for use elsewhere. That these dams will be exclusively hydropower and not multipurpose dams and that there will be a great unevenness in the distribution of potential gains and losses - and of vulnerability to risks - accounts for a serious legitimacy deficit in India's ambitious hydropower development plans in the region. The enclosure of the water commons - the inevitable outcome of these dams - will have a devastating impact on the lives of millions, especially the rural poor who depend on the water commons in multiple ways for their living. What is occurring in the Brahmaputra Valley today is resistance by a riverine people against powerful elites bent on pursuing a strategy of accumulation by dispossession, and trying to turn their rivers into free fuel for hydropower plants, in utter disregard of the impact on their lives and livelihoods.||SANJIB BARUAH

The resistance to colonial forest policies forced the administration in the Madras Presidency to look for options to pacify public discontent. At the level of policy, it was the dominant agrarian communities that evolved an effective link with political parties and the native press, compelling the revenue department and the colonial state to recognise their claims. A community-centred forest management policy, implemented in the form of village forest panchayats, delegated management powers to the dominant agrarian communities. This mainly benefited the rural elite, ignoring the claims of poor peasants, pastoralists, agricultural labour and women.||V M RAVI KUMAR

Focusing the ethnographic gaze on this temporal shift in the course of fieldwork in a Delhi neighbourhood, this paper argues that marriage becomes an ontological site for the doing of life itself. Further, the time of after marriage is marked by the work of nibhaana in a multiplicity of enactments that go beyond English equivalents such as the observance of or abiding by norms. The centrality of nibhaana also suggests that the ethicisation of any relationship of two people would still be based on a grammar of dutiful observance, sacrifice, categorisations of fidelity, labour and openness to a life of contingent events. Although linked with resignation and a generalised negativity, in its complex demands, nibhaana calls for new terms of engagement across feminist writings to envision non-essentialist recordings of what being married entails.||GEETIKA BAPNA

The issue has been discussed at length by a number of reports on taxation as well as in the literature on tax policy in India. This paper seeks to reignite this debate at two levels: one by asking for a more comprehensive taxation of incomes, implying thereby taxation of agricultural incomes as well. The second is the need to use current legislation to ensure that the exemption base of agricultural income from taxation is kept as narrow as possible as against expanding it.||D P SENGUPTA,R KAVITA RAO

All too often, projects are undertaken not with the purpose of internal capacity building and supporting the poor but rather to show off their progress in terms of the sheer number of schemes launched.

9/6/2012- ||special articles||23214923||Reflections on the Current Crisis and Its Effects||The crisis of capital at the present juncture when capitalism is deeply financialised is extremely difficult to resolve. The main structural problem of the system is the downward pressure on the rate of profit, but further financialisation is no longer a sustainable solution. The demands of fictitious capital to be remunerated can only be fulfilled by the transfer of an ever greater surplus of productive capital, and this is possible only through an ever-increasing rate of exploitation of labour. The relaunch of a fresh cycle of expansion however requires the destruction of gigantic amounts of fictitious capital, but such devaluation risks pushing the capitalist system towards collapse. Clearly, it is time for the left to come up with radical proposals and, in this respect, the most difficult questions to deal with are those concerning money and finance.||RÉMY HERRERA

But if the objective is growth, jobs and financial stability, we need to go back to managing the exchange rate in order to maintain the external value of the rupee around a level which would keep the current account deficit within +/− 1% of GDP. If the cost of intervention and sterilisation becomes unaffordable, the solution would be to impose controls on capital movement, rather than giving up management of the exchange rate.||A V RAJWADE

An analysis of existing, relevant literature, with examples drawn from parts of the developing world along with experiences from India has been presented. Using the specific case of the wild harvested medicinal plant sector in Kerala, certification as a potential strategy to achieve a win-win scenario is hypothesised.

It groups individuals into classes and documents patterns of mobility at the rural, urban and all-India levels, and for different caste groups. It finds substantial intergenerational persistence, particularly in the case of low-skilled and low-paying occupations, e g, almost half the children of agricultural labourers end up becoming agricultural labourers.

It shows that there is excessive litigation under the current land acquisition law. It is argued that any compulsory acquisition-based process is inherently prone to litigation, even if accompanied by presumably benevolent schemes such as land-for-land and the rehabilitation and resettlement packages. The paper offers suggestions on how to reform the regulatory framework that governs agricultural land and its use. It discusses the Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill 2011 and reveals how the bill leaves open several back doors for states to favour companies, and how it fails to address the fundamental causes behind the rampant disputes and litigation over compensation.||RAM SINGH

This analysis, through a primary survey carried out on the outskirts of Jaipur in Rajasthan, suggests a mixed picture. Participation in paid work is likely to bring some benefits to women but beyond a point the benefits are context-specific – whether women enter the labour force out of sheer survival necessity or due to other reasons. These findings provide neither a neat narrative that paid work is empowering women by providing them with choices and freedom, nor do they convey that paid work is demeaning and devoid of any important benefit. Instead, the findings call for considering a context-specific view of the potential of paid work for women's well-being and underline the significance of public policy in enhancing the well-being of poor women in India.||SUNNY JOSE

The institution of CAG has suddenly come of age and has realised its public responsibility. A startled government in power has been floundering to find a credible reaction. There have been two predictable lines of response – to question the jurisdiction and mandate of the CAG and to question the "presumptive" loss computed by the agency, implying that the reports have no credibility. In other words the main approach has been to "shoot the messenger".||T S R SUBRAMANIAN

Based on extensive fieldwork, the paper argues that the rapidly changed and changing political economy of this region has thrown up certain contradictions in society which have come to pose a challenge to the hitherto established cultural norms that decree infliction and widespread acceptance of violence upon women. Through individual life experiences of rural women, it highlights women's understanding of violence, their self-assertion and resistance as well as the importance given by them to different options in handling or containing violence.||PREM CHOWDHRY

This study analyses the economic effects of various farm programmes, as enacted in various Farm Acts. The analysis shows that most of the domestic farm programmes are geared towards affecting production, directly or indirectly. These include the totally coupled programmes like the non-recourse loan programme, partially coupled programmes like the production flexibility contract payments, and largely decoupled payments like the direct payments and counter-cyclical payments. The coupled programmes have the maximum market-distorting effect because they are linked to current production. Decoupled programmes like ccps reduce revenue variability and the risk faced by the farmers. The combined effect of these programmes is to insulate the us farmer from the market to a large extent and stabilise his returns from farming. In addition, there are commodity-specific programmes like the peanut programme, sugar and sweetener policy, etc, which perhaps make the us farm sector one of the most supported farm sectors in the world. This high level of domestic support has implications for production and export surpluses, and in turn, for the world markets.||C S C SEKHAR,YOGESH CHANDRA BHATT

However, after a critical scrutiny of this neo-liberal model of healthcare delivery, this paper concludes that the scheme is only the construction of a new system that supplants the severely underfunded state healthcare system.

Assets are a product of accumulated income, reflecting long-term well-being, and thus are important for determining livelihood choices. While there is general agreement that few women own key assets, there is no systematic sex-disaggregated asset data to measure or monitor. Households are the unit of analysis in standard surveys, where the only feasible gender analysis is by sex of the household head. Using data from a state-representative survey conducted in 2010-11, this paper presents estimates of the gender asset and wealth gaps. The results show substantial gender disparities with respect to asset ownership and wealth.||HEMA SWAMINATHAN,RAHUL LAHOTI,SUCHITRA J Y

Globally, the experience of countries even with the most advanced regimes for incorporating these issues shows that addressing them effectively remains a challenge. The Cartagena Biosafety Protocol, the only global instrument for governance of genetically modified crops, does not address these considerations. Thus policy frameworks depend primarily on domestic concerns and priorities. Recent attempts to separate socio-economic assessment from biosafety assessment processes and conduct the two in parallel appear to embody a more pragmatic approach. The proposed Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India Bill must draw upon this international experience and associated insight.||SACHIN CHATURVEDI,KRISHNA RAVI SRINIVAS,REJI K JOSEPH,PALLAVI SINGH

This paper analyses the case for, and against, replacing a reformed version of this system with a targeted and differentiated cash transfer scheme. Such a scheme could cover about two-thirds of households, and make far larger transfers to the poorest compared to the actual subsidy embedded in the current system, eliminating the risk of large exclusion errors. Further, the overall budget can be held at the present outlay level. It is argued that most of the objections to such a transfer scheme can be circumvented at the design stage.||PETER SVEDBERG

The performance, however, has varied across regions within the state and among crop groups. Price policies in favour of cereals discourage land diversification, but rising agricultural wages induce shifts in favour of high-value crops. The growth momentum has to be sustained by price reforms and by promoting a set of non-price factors that encourages resource diversification towards high-value crops.||LALMANI PANDEY

These have led to a dynamism in the local economy in these areas. The results of this study suggest that the impact of this development has been skewed, whereby a small section of the population with access to capital has enjoyed substantial benefits and a large majority of the population was left out of the development trajectory. This paper analyses the impact of prawn farming on employment and income on different sections of the population in the Sunderban estuarine region.||SHANTANU DE ROY

The writings indicate that communalism is an outcome of the competitive aspirations of domination and counter-domination that began in colonial times. Cynical distortions of the democratic process and the politicisation of religion in the early decades of Independence intensified it. In recent years, economic liberalisation, the growth of opportunities and a multiplying middle class have further aggravated it. More alarmingly, since the 1980s, Hindu communalism has morphed into fundamentalism, with the Sangh parivar and its cultural politics of Hindutva playing ominous roles.||SURYA PRAKASH UPADHYAY,ROWENA ROBINSON

The Dilaasa crisis centres at two public hospitals in Mumbai since 2001 have been established out of the recognition that the public health system is an important site for the implementation of anti-domestic violence intervention programmes. The crisis centres therefore straddle both discourses of public health and gender. The paper offers critical insights into the model and its impact in terms of its ability to reach out to women who are undergoing abuse and offer them multiple services in one setting.||PADMA BHATE-DEOSTHALI,T K SUNDARI RAVINDRAN,U VINDHYA

It must be clear to the scholars of Nepal that the nature of structural violence and inequality in the country is not about "ethnicity" alone.

This has happened by licensing a number of privately-owned engineering colleges. Consequently, enrolment in engineering increased from about 2,800 in 1991 to about 28,000 in 2008. After a careful analysis of a unique data set, this study reaches the conclusion that actual out-turn rates have been steadily declining, especially since 2004. This decline is observed at the aggregate level, across different branches and also across different colleges. It then hypothesises about the probable causes for this steady decline in out-turn rates and concludes with the larger implications of this state of affairs.||SUNIL MANI,M ARUN

This paper argues that, for the rural Indian context, where housing is too lumpy and illiquid to be used for consumption smoothing, transitions in housing quality in cross-sectional data sets can provide revealed evidence of household perceptions of downside risk to their current consumption levels. Using the two most recent National Sample Survey housing surveys (the 58th round for 2002 and the 65th round for 2008-09), composite housing quality classifications are unbundled, and binary wall quality is selected from cross-quartile behaviour as the feature most responsive to rising household consumption levels. In both rounds, the incremental move to better quality declines beyond the consumption level at which half of all households are in better quality structures. The threshold consumption level at which this happens was lower in 2008-09 than in 2002 and reflects an improvement in housing conditions over the period. However, this effective saturation of the demand for the most basic element of better housing, much before actual saturation, provides a quantitative measure of the percentage of households even in the topmost quartile that fears downside consumption risk.||ABHIROOP MUKHOPADHYAY,INDIRA RAJARAMAN

Although private schools have higher raw mean scores than government schools, after controlling for observed student and school characteristics the private school advantage in test scores is not robust. The sources of private school advantage lie in the types of students choosing these schools, lower pupil teacher ratios and much lower teacher salaries. Private schools have seven to eight times lower teacher salaries but do not differ systematically in infrastructure and teacher effort from government schools. Given the large salary differential, private schools are more cost effective although quality of education is low in both school types.||SANGEETA GOYAL,PRIYANKA PANDEY

Moreover, the poor socio-economic background of ASHAs makes them depend on the incentives offered since this is their main source of income. Additionally, due to the excessive focus of ASHAs on curative care, the community considers them more an extended arm of the health service system, not as change agents as envisaged in the programme.||SUJAY R JOSHI,MATHEW GEORGE

Yet governments of developing countries have not given adequate importance to the run-up to the conference. As has happened in the climate change negotiations, the outcome draft now under negotiation shows a concerted move to rewrite the terms of global environmental governance.

But when he considered the system of property he became pessimistic and gloomy, and foresaw only doom and class conflict, exploitation and downfall. Marx often made history progress by what he called its dark side, but we ought to take a new look at the brighter side of human work, labour and usage rather than simply the concept of property as ownership. This paper makes a plea for home-rule in the organisation of production, especially for labour, and does not attach the same or a greater importance to the modes of ownership of property as title in the market.||J P S UBEROI

The first decade after reforms (from 1993-94 to 2001-02) was characterised by a relatively low export growth rate of 8% a year, while the second decade (from 2002-03 to 2010-11) stands apart for its strong growth of 21% a year. The growth rate is at an impressive 24% per annum during the pre-financial crisis period of 2002-03 to 2008-09. These trends, based on India's official export data, have been further confirmed using "mirror statistics" that have been constructed on the basis of imports reported by India's trading partners. The composition of exports has undergone consistent changes in favour of capital and skill-intensive products. The lack of dynamism in labour-intensive exports is a matter of concern because it is this sector that holds the potential to absorb the large pool of surplus labour from agriculture. The analysis shows a major shift in India's export destination from the traditional developed country markets to the emerging markets in Asia and Africa.||C VEERAMANI

More alarming is the serious shortage of faculty in institutions of higher learning, unequal access to the institutions, the non-availability of textbooks in Indian languages and students who are ill-equipped to handle the rigours of college education.||SHOBHIT MAHAJAN

21/4/2012- ||commentary||23214589||Delhi Metro Rail: Beyond Mass Transit||A decade has gone since the first line of metro started in Delhi in 2002. Despite its expansion across the city in the past 10 years neither pollution nor congestion levels have gone down as claimed by its advocates. An analysis of the revenue generated by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation through property development and the rise of property prices adjacent to metro routes and stations suggests that the metro is entangled with the larger process of gentrification in the city. It is restructuring urban space for capital accumulation by a series of dispossessions of the poor and by giving priority to metro routes for middle class colonies. Thus the metro may fulfil the dreams of the ruling class and their city planners of transforming Delhi into a "world class city". But so far it has failed to provide equitable mass transit to the city.||PRITPAL RANDHAWA

However, reality refuses to bend to the desire for theoretical elegance that an economist demands from his model. Modelling itself on mathematics, mainstream economics is primarily deductive and based on axiomatic foundations. Econophysics seeks to be inductive, to be an empirically founded science based on observations, with the tools of mathematics and logic used to identify and establish relations among these observations. Econophysics does not strive to reinterpret empirical data to conform to a theorist's expectations, but describes the mechanisms by which economic systems actually evolve over time.||SITABHRA SINHA,BIKAS K CHAKRABARTI

But agricultural transition has not been uniform across Asia and the future of smallholder agriculture faces several challenges arising from a range of socio-economic, demographic, structural and institutional factors that could adversely affect its sustainability. This paper critically reviews the divergent experiences of agricultural transformation in five Asian countries - Bangladesh, India, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam - from a comparative perspective and points to the need for evolving new perspectives and policies towards sustainable and non-disruptive transformation of smallholder agriculture in Asia.||P K VISWANATHAN,GOPAL B THAPA,JAYANT K ROUTRAY,MOKBUL M AHMAD

Examining the key ingredients for success in such a system, this note highlights the cultural and institutional challenges it faces in the Indian context. These in India include an emphasis on theoretical relative to practical knowledge, highly structured hierarchies on the shop floor and a lack of incentives for the participating Industrial Training Institutes. In addition, the apprenticeship paradigm requires strong cooperation between the state, industrial associations and participating companies as well as a corporate mindset that recognises that effective apprentices cannot be bought off the market but require nurturing on the shop floor.||GAUDENZ PFISTER

It is shown that a majority of the commodities were subject to inflationary pressures due to domestic supply-side constraints. They include pulses, fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, spices, tea, coffee and sugar. Cost escalation was the primary reason for rising prices of milk and eggs. The high inflation of rice was caused by a complex interplay of factors. With the exception of milk, the paper finds no concrete evidence to support the popular view that the higher food prices in recent years was the outcome of a "secular shift" in food consumption patterns towards high-value agriculture products. Developments in the global economy have influenced the domestic food prices mainly through passing on world oil price increases. High cost food imports played only a very limited role.||STHANU R NAIR,LEENA MARY EAPEN

30/6/2012-7/7/2012||special articles||23251690||Questing History: Excluded Citizens and State Response to Demands for Inclusion||Due to the problematic meaning of "tribe", the modern state is confused over the procedure it should follow in the recognition of a community as a tribe and, therefore, state recognition of a community as a tribe has always remained much contested in the postcolonial state response. Given this, the state tries to politicise the reality of being "objectified". It is thus necessary to build a workable definition of the term for constitutional purpose to avoid such politics. This paper illustrates the issue by debating the exclusion of the Kamar community of Nuapada district of Orissa (the erstwhile Khariar zamindari of the Central Provinces) that earlier enjoyed tribal status. Foregrounding the historical condition that has shaped unrest among the Kamar, it provides insights into the complex process of their demand for inclusion and the state politics of recognition despite the historical truth of the community.||BHUBANESWAR SABAR

The bill of the Government of India to regulate this booming market was drafted at the behest of the very industry it seeks to regulate, and is meant not so much to offer protection to the women surrogates but to the industry. This article suggests that we recognise this business as exploitative and involving the appropriation of surplus labour, albeit with some special characteristics, and as a result, evoke a different set of policy implications.||MOHAN RAO

A study of this and other cases in which the cci has successfully completed enquiries shows the working of a very different law and commission from that of the earlier mrtp Act. The cci's successes will hopefully send the right signals to all the stakeholders about the law and the consequences of its violation. However, there is enormous scope for improvement in both the Act and its enforcement before India's competition policy is raised to international standards.||ADITYA BHATTACHARJEA,OINDRILA DE

The export of capital is a sizeable fraction of the foreign direct investment inflow over the last six years.

22/12/2012- ||special article||23391158||India's Labour Market during the 2000s: Surveying the Changes||The growth of gross domestic product in every sub-sector of the Indian economy accelerated during the second half of the 2000s, compared to the first half of the decade. However, employment growth in most sectors except construction decelerated. This jobless growth was partly the result of positive changes such as the reduction of "distress employment" in agriculture, created during the previous half-decade, and an expansion in the population of students. Rural wages rose and average educational levels of the workforce improved. Government interventions in rural India since the mid-2000s, particularly the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, seemed to have aided these positive transformations. However, manufacturing employment in the country fell and employment growth slowed down in most constituents of the services sector. The new jobs generated were predominantly in rural construction. The slow progress in the diversification of India's employment structure has led to large-scale withdrawal of women from the labour force, with the number of women thus "missing" being as large as the population of Brazil.||JAYAN JOSE THOMAS

The attempt is to explore the twin processes of translation and the writing of "original works" which were seen to be constitutive in the making of the Hindi intellectual. The attempt is to also look at some of these debates through the apparent binaries of translation versus original, national versus individual, poetry versus prose and political versus literary. This often contradictory process was an outcome of a period where the idea of the "individual genius", borrowed from the west, was still taking shape.||AVINASH KUMAR

This note elucidates his conception of the economy as three distinct, yet interdependent systems — (1) production, distribution and exchange, (2) money, interest and prices, and (3) international trade and finance. It is, indeed, striking to find such a comprehensive account of the mechanisms operating in an economy in a text nearly three centuries old. These insights regarding the working of an economy, although a pre-capitalist one, provide a distinct approach to studying today's economic problems. This is the surplus approach of classical political economy, revived by Piero Sraffa in 1960.||ALEX M THOMAS

Despite their valuable contributions, CPRs are faced with decline in terms of both extent as well as contribution to the people, and therefore consequent neglect by the communities. This paper looks into the process of this negative change, and attributes the same to public policies, market forces and population growth (accentuating land hunger) along with the disintegration of traditional collective approaches of communities to maintain CPRs as community assets.||NARPAT S JODHA,NAVEEN P SINGH,CYNTHIA S BANTILAN

The focus continues to be on increasing production with little regard for demand-side aspects (biofuels, meat-based diets, etc) and inequality in consumption.

But a key feature of regulated markets – the use of auctions to sell produce – has attracted relatively little attention. This paper argues that the auction mechanism is central to protecting farmers' interests in a given market, even in the presence of collusion among some large buyers. More generally, it is a transparent mechanism of price discovery and sets a benchmark with which any new market set up by a private player has to compete, thus mitigating any adverse impact on prices received by farmers.||A BANERJI,NEHA GUPTA,J V MEENAKSHI

The large number of riotous situations faced by the police are simply staggering and perhaps among the highest in the world. Politics, poor governance, inability to meet rising expectations and absence of standard conflict resolution mechanisms explain much of this group violence. Yet, the role of the police and its leadership in handling and diffusing violent situations remains largely unexamined. In this paper, two cases of group violence in Bihar are presented to assess the role of local and senior police officials. The anti-Sikh riots at Palamau in 1984 and the anti-Muslim riots at Bhagalpur in 1989 provide insight into the organisational dynamics of the Indian police and help explain police performance in handling group violence. It is argued that apart from the well-known factor of political control that affects police functions in the country, organisational matters of training, resources, communications and leadership are also significant factors. The implications of the 2002 Gujarat riots are also discussed.||ARVIND VERMA

It looks carefully at the notion of "under-recoveries" oil companies and attempts to compare it with their profits under an alternative pricing regime. It concludes that under the suggested pricing structure the surplus generated in the oil sector will be sufficiently large to wipe out the much advertised fiscal deficit sustained by the government on account of oil subsidies – without raising the price of the essential oil products.

The direct revenue impact was assessed by testing if VAT introduction increased VAT or state's own revenue buoyancies or the VAT or SOR to GSDP ratios. The indirect impact of VAT introduction on the VAT base (proxied by GSDP) and base growth were also examined. No indirect impacts of the VAT on its base was found. The direct revenue impact of the VAT was found to be positive in two-thirds of sample jurisdictions. A positive impact on SOR was however found only in Orissa and Haryana among 11 major states and 50% of other jurisdictions. Limited VAT revenue performance can partly be traced to large-scale evasion given weaknesses in VAT administration identified in a 2009 performance audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General. The implications of this study for the planned move to a goods and services VAT (from the current goods only VAT) are drawn and a suggestion is made for a non-VAT goods and services tax which should be less vulnerable to tax evasion.||ARINDAM DAS-GUPTA

Canada's contributions to development of the theory and practice of multiculturalism are well known. However, within Canada itself there are segments like the aboriginal peoples who consider that multiculturalism does not adequately address their problems, experiences and concerns. Looking at different trajectories that have shaped Canadian multiculturalism, this article throws light on the aboriginal critique of multiculturalism and shows how the indigenous peoples of Canada have been shaping their own future outside the framework of multiculturalism.||H SRIKANTH

The rejection of capitalism in many of left movements in the South tends to be accompanied not only by imagining alternatives, but also by shifting views about what constitutes the desirable alternative. This, in turn, has meant an interrogation of some previously standard tenets of socialist understanding. This essay reviews several features of emerging left movements in Latin America, Africa and developing Asia that suggest a move away from some traditional ideas associated with socialist theory and practice even as there are two important areas of continuity with the leftist thinking of the past.||JAYATI GHOSH

Further, the conceptualisation of the postponement order as a means to balance the two rights is flawed.

One, it is risky for an agrarian country to liberalise internal trade in commodities without a powerful regulator in place. Two, lending institutions do not consider commodities as a standard asset class because they lack back-end infrastructure and well-regulated liquid markets. Three, foreign direct investment can be attracted to build infrastructure in the commodities supply chain only if there is a powerful regulator that ensures integrity and investor confidence in the marketplace.||K G SAHADEVAN

Through the example of selected states — Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala, Rajasthan and West Bengal — it demonstrates application of the concept. The physical extent of change has been estimated for the period of 1991-2001. The loss of the inland wetland for this period comes to around 0.46 million ha during this 10-year-period. By applying the benefit transfer method, the monetary value of the annual physical loss in the inland wetland for the combined five states has been estimated to be $1,022 million at 1999-2000 prices. The paper estimates the per capita loss for the states. The maximum loss on per capita basis is for J&K ($221 and 11% of the state domestic product) while that for the combined states is $11.57. The paper attempts to suggest that ecosystem accounting is a required step towards developing the indicator for sustainable development, also referred to as the "green economy".||PUSHPAM KUMAR

The central problem is not profligate spending in the periphery, but the very set-up of the European Monetary Union. Without attending to current account imbalances within the eurozone, austerity will be self-defeating. Deflation and depressed growth will heighten the debt problem while continuing to ignite social ruin. The EU must become an entity with a unified and expanded fiscal policy and a central bank willing and able to act as lender of last resort. If austerity and structural reform continue to be the only options, Greece will bear witness to a lost generation and a likely end to the euro project in its present form.||RANIA ANTONOPOULOS,DIMITRI B PAPADIMITRIOU

The first dispute was over the north-eastern sector and the second was over Aksai Chin. Jawaharlal Nehru's refusal to submit the dispute to negotiation meant it became diplomatically insoluble and his attempt to make the Indian claims good on the ground through military force challenged China to war. Successor governments have maintained his refusal to submit India's border claims to negotiation and the "talks" in which they have engaged Beijing cannot lead to settlement. But if the Government of India reversed Nehru's approach and agreed to negotiate, settlement could still be reached because each country holds the territory vital to it.||NEVILLE MAXWELL

The structural change observed is a reduction in the share of households dependent on the farm sector due to a decline in the share of cultivators in the workforce. Correspondingly, the set of non-cultivating "peasant" households is increasing in importance and its stakes in land are also on the rise. The NCPHS have a low incentive to invest in agriculture. This has implications for agricultural growth and brings into focus the constraints to agrarian transformation. National Sample Survey data on household assets and liabilities in India is used to illustrate this structural change in the rural sector with increasing importance of the NCPH. At a second level, data from a primary survey conducted in nine villages in Andhra Pradesh is used to identify the micro-processes strengthening the NCPH in rural areas.||R VIJAY

Instead it analyses the ways in which they create a sense of place through neighbourhoods, food, faith, and protest. This "north-east map of Delhi" allows the migrants to survive the city and to construct a cosmopolitan identity at odds with the ways they are stereotyped in the Indian mainstream.||DUNCAN MCDUIE-RA

The Indian experience also reveals that religious groups are not homogeneous.

1/12/2012- ||special article||41720413||The Age Distribution of Missing Women in India||Relative to developed countries, there are far fewer women than men in India. Estimates suggest that among the stock of women who could potentially be alive today, over 25 million are "missing". Sex selection at birth and the mistreatment of young girls are widely regarded as key explanations. We provide a decomposition of missing women by age across the states. While we do not dispute the existence of severe gender bias at young ages, our computations yield some striking findings. First, the vast majority of missing women in India are of adult age. Second, there is significant variation in the distribution of missing women by age across different states. Missing girls at birth are most pervasive in some north-western states, but excess female mortality at older ages is relatively low. In contrast, some north-eastern states have the highest excess female mortality in adulthood but the lowest number of missing women at birth. The state-wise variation in the distribution of missing women across the age groups makes it very difficult to draw simple conclusions to explain the missing women phenomenon in India.||SIWAN ANDERSON,DEBRAJ RAY

It will not do to blame the Greek crisis for the rupee's problems.||K SUBRAMANIAN
16/6/2012- ||special articles||23214897||On Understanding the Decline of the Established Indian Left||The inability of the Indian left to construct a project of the transcendence of capitalism (the central thesis of Patnaik) is understood as constituted within a crisis of world Marxism that began with the crystallisation of the Stalinist counter-revolution which paraded state capitalism as authentic socialism. This essay is on reading the misunderstanding of the fundamentals of Marx's scientific discovery by the established left in India, especially on the transient characters of commodity production, value and the state; and that communism transcends commodity production and abolishes the state immediately after the revolution. As the established Indian left took the non-Marxist model of commodity production governed by an alleged "socialist" state, it was destined to be destroyed by the inner contradictions of state capitalism. To project a transcendence of capitalism one needs to project a world that is devoid of commodities, money and the state. It is this task that the left in India in alliance with international communism must concentrate on.||MURZBAN JAL

Political quotas are meant to address the absence of those who are excluded because of the inegalitarian social structures in which political processes are enacted. This is accepted as a legitimate justification for scheduled caste and scheduled tribe quotas in legislatures and Parliament. Reserved quotas for women are a fair extension of that same principle. The Women's Reservation Bill must empower women to address their situation politically, not to serve the old hierarchies once again. An effective implementation of reserved quotas for women in legislatures and Parliament is a must to bring a more participative and inclusive, a more egalitarian and sensitive citizenship for all.||RUDI HEREDIA

10/11/2012- ||special article||41720354||On the Interpersonal Inclusiveness of India's Consumption Expenditure Growth||This paper reviews the evidence on the interpersonal inclusiveness of the growth in consumption expenditure that has occurred in India over the last four decades or so. The notion of dynamic inclusiveness is framed in terms of imagined normative allocations of the inter-temporal product of growth, as dictated by notions of equity of varying orders of demandingness. There are analytical parallels between these exercises and those involved in the study of bankruptcy in "Talmudic estate problems", as well as in the determination of optimal anti-poverty budgetary allocations. Inclusive growth in this paper is assessed with respect to inclusiveness across income classes. The results of the investigation undertaken in the essay suggest distressingly little evidence of interpersonal inclusiveness in India's consumption growth experience.||D JAYARAJ,S SUBRAMANIAN

Analysing conventional and new data sources "against the grain", this paper claims support for the existence of such economically vital small settlements, contrary to perceptions that India's urbanisation is slow, that its smaller settlements are stagnant and its cities are not productive. It offers a classification scheme for settlements using the axes of spatial proximity to metropolises and degree of administrative recognition, and looks at the potential factors for their transformation along economic, social and political dimensions. Instead of basing policy on illusions of control, understanding how agents make this world helps comprehend ongoing Indian transformations.||ERIC DENIS,PARTHA MUKHOPADHYAY,MARIE-HÉLÈNE ZéRAH

The respondents are seen to be caught between the imperatives of early marriage and girlhood employment, but they insist upon the value of education for their daughters. Many of them have experienced and suffered early marriage and childbirth and are vehement in their rejection of such a trajectory for their daughters, even though not all of them are able to carry through such decisions. Parents from urban working-class neighbourhoods are not obsessed with sexual chastity of their daughters; they accept courtships and elopements, sometimes hailing the latter with some relief. What these mothers share with their middle class counterparts is an interest in tremendous investment in their children's education, which is in both cases accompanied by great expectations for the future.||SAMITA SEN,NILANJANA SENGUPTA

The advocacy is couched within the neo-liberal discourse of educational markets, parental choice and school vouchers. This paper looks at some of the evidence that is available on budget/low-cost schooling in India, and the edu-business emerging around this sector in the light of aspirations of low-income parents for private education for their children. The paper concludes that while the picture on low-cost schooling is fragmentary, there appears to be little evidence or possibility of the promise of high quality education for a low fee from private players in this sector.||GEETHA B NAMBISSAN

What emerges is that while the relative performance of public sector banks had improved significantly by 2005-06, the new private sector banks had moved ahead by 2010-11. It appears that early gains by public sector banks may have been the result of initial slack in the system and new gains will require radical changes in human resource management and corporate governance practices. Such reforms are urgent in the light of the proposal to issue new banking licences.||SIDHARTH SINHA

By drawing on a detailed case study of the Dera Sachkhand Ballan, Punjab, it argues that for organisations such as the DSB, which are engaged in modes of subaltern religiosity, transnationalism can be a powerful agent of religious and social change. By cultivating its transnational links, especially in the United Kingdom, the DSB has now emerged as the main driver of Ravidassi identity in Punjab. This achievement would not have been possible without the material support of overseas followers for whom the building of social and religious institutions in Punjab has been intimately linked with the search for a separate Ravidassi identity and the need to demonstrate to higher castes in Punjab their sense of collective achievement. Transnationalism has thus been central to a process of differentiation between the followers of the DSB and Sikhism and has accelerated this trend since the Vienna incident in 2009.||GURHARPAL SINGH
30/6/2012-7/7/2012||special articles||23251688||Migration and Exclusionary Urbanisation in India||An analysis of migration and urbanisation patterns in recent decades suggests a distinctly declining trend. It can be argued that the migration process has an inbuilt screening system, which is picking up people from relatively higher economic and social strata. The decline in the share of migrants moving in search of employment and an increase in business and study-related mobility further confirms this proposition. In contrast, poverty-induced migration has become a less important component of mobility over time. At the same time, in a bid to attract private capital, urban centres have become less accommodating to the poor, restricting their entry and thereby increasing rural-urban economic inequalities. The strategy of spatially unbalanced growth through "dispersal of concentrations" advocated by the World Bank and others, therefore, needs to be examined with empirical rigour.||AMITABH KUNDU,LOPAMUDRA RAY SARASWATI

How are the multinational pharmaceutical companies responding to the new policy environment? Is India likely to see monopolisation of the industry and high prices, which was the pattern before 1972 when India had product patent protection? Will the positive features of the post-1972 process patent era be diluted or negated? This study finds that the MNCS have started marketing new patented drugs in India at exorbitant prices particularly for life-threatening diseases such as cancer. The manufacturing and importing behaviour of the MNCS since the 1990s bear a close resemblance to that before the 1970s. Imports of high-priced finished formulations are expanding rapidly with manufacturing investments lagging far behind. The MNCS are also expanding vigorously in the generic segments and are trying to grow not only organically but through mergers & acquisitions and strategic alliance with Indian generic companies.||SUDIP CHAUDHURI

Charles Taylor has influentially argued for such a position for some time. This paper presents reasons to reject such an understanding of secularism. But, as a result of this alternative conceptualisation, the paper makes two further arguments. First, for the conclusion that secularism is not a general political truth, suited to all historical contexts, but rather apt only in some contexts, such as, for instance, when there is an implicit and pervasive threat of "majoritarianism". And second, for the conclusion that any justification and implementation of secularism in contexts which are not fully modernist —in a sense of "modern" that was articulated first in western Europe - must turn on an appeal to the conceptual vernacular.||AKEEL BILGRAMI

Based on a series of interviews and discussions with Muslim women working in different institutional set-ups overa period of two years, this study argues that we should pay more attention to their subjectivity, i e, ways in which they inhabit, attempt and change established social practices in the given conditions rather than on the oppositions or challenges to the "religion" and "state" or "feminism" that such activisms pose. Taking a close look at the activist trajectories, perspectives and work of Muslim women activists in Hyderabad, it argues that their articulation of rights and education is predicated on self-reliance which is posited as a prerequisite for the contemporary Muslim woman to inhabit the space of the Muslim community and citizenship.||A SUNEETHA

Horizontal learning describes a process-oriented approach that emphasises networking amongst global South nations leading to legislative development and policy experimentation. As a means to explore this new development approach, this paper examines India's attempt to appropriate, for use in a draft mining bill, elements of the law of a similarly situated developing country, South Africa. The case study suggests that a failure to retain the underlying social and political policy motivations for the model legislation can undermine the ability of the new legal regime to effectuate its policy goals.||CHARLES MADDOX,JONATHAN BURTON-MACLEOD,JASON JACKSON

This paper attempts to address some missing links. With the help of time use statistics, it argues that the missing labour force does not imply withdrawal of women (and maybe some men) from the labour market. A large part of the missing labour is missing only from the NSSO data but is very much there in the labour force -though a small part may be due to withdrawal. It appears "missing" because of the inability of the NSSO surveys to capture it adequately. This "non-missing labour force" has important implications for the employment and labour policy in the country. The paper also argues that time use statistics has the potential of overcoming some weaknesses of the NSSO as well as of adding new information on the labour force.||INDIRA HIRWAY

In adivasi livelihoods, work is foundational and only through work does a person know what his or her potentialities are. The current adivasi struggles are at bottom attempts to reclaim this foundational value of work and all that it entails.||SAVYASAACHI

Plurilateralism is being pushed in many quarters as a potential means of overcoming the impasse that has emerged in the Doha Round of talks. Using insights from history, the article argues that the shift to plurilateralism is nothing new. Indeed the trade system has been built nearly continuously on such agreements. But the current push holds great danger for developing countries, particularly the least developed among them.||JAMES SCOTT,RORDEN WILKINSON

All except one of these states are in the Hindi heartland which is known for its fractured polity. These enactments are perhaps an attempt to regain the faith of the middle class in the political and bureaucratic system. While there are limitations in their conceptualisation and implementation, the enthusiasm of the respective state bureaucracies in pushing for these laws is encouraging. A number of measures suggested herein could help reduce the shortcomings in the legislation.||ASHOK KUMAR SIRCAR

There is a stable presence of upper caste candidates from all major parties, with the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress continuing to field them predominantly, while the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party have become more of "catch-all" parties, similar yet very different from the Congress Party of the past. The study of ministers and MLAs reveals a more complex picture of upper caste strength in representation.||CHRISTOPHE JAFFRELOT,GILLES VERNIERS

This paper critically examines the scheme and its implementation from the equality and justice perspectives. It argues that the equal educational opportunity doctrine, a state commitment in the 1960s, was abandoned with the National Policy on Education 1986, which resulted in a multilayered, inegalitarian school system for subordinate communities. Are schemes like the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, which tend to privilege a minuscule number of school dropouts, a subversion of the equality principle, privileging a few over the majority?||SADHNA SAXENA

The results suggest that public sector banks, on an average, adjusted to the changing environment better and improved their performance relative to their counterparts under private and foreign ownership. This finding has important policy implications in that the government should be more cautious in liberalising the Indian banking sector and not blindly invite more foreign players to it.||ANUP KUMAR BHANDARI

But the agreement has raised apprehensions on the possibility of large-scale import of commodities from the ASEAN countries, affecting the livelihood of many stakeholders. Fisheries is one area of concern since some of the ASEAN members — Thailand, Vietnam and Indonesia — are leading exporters of fisheries products. Using simple revealed comparative advantage indices, this paper looks at the likely impact of the agreement on India's fisheries trade by identifying the complementarity and competing product categories. The simulation results show that tariff reduction will have a trade creation effect, an improvement in welfare and limited tariff revenue decline. The study also shows that the India-ASEAN FTA may not lead to large-scale import of marine products and affect the livelihood of fisherfolk.||B P SARATH CHANDRAN,P K SUDARSAN

Its primary interest is to examine the transition from informal employment in the unorganised sector towards formal employment in the non-agricultural organised sector. There has been a slight structural shift in employment away from agriculture towards the non-manufacturing sector. An interesting dimension about this transformation is the rising employment in enterprises employing 20 or more workers and a decline in employment in enterprises employing less than six workers. The second half of the decade (characterised by high growth rates) witnessed a decline in employment in the manufacturing sector, while there was stagnation in services sector employment. With the rise in participation in education (in particular female education), it is most likely that a larger number of educated youth, especially women, will be joining the labour force in future years, and given the fact that the highest open unemployment rate is among educated youth, this calls for more proactive policies towards employment creation in organised manufacturing and services sectors.||SANTOSH MEHROTRA,ANKITA GANDHI,BIMAL KISHORE SAHOO,PARTHA SAHA

This has revived the debate on the evolving international monetary system and the international reserve currency that will underpin it. Since the 1940s, the US dollar remains the world's dominant reserve currency. Developments since 2008 have challenged the pre-eminence of the US dollar. The euro appeared to have provided an alternative during 2000-08, but has come under fire since early 2010. Prospects for internationalisation of emerging economy currencies are still limited. The global crisis of 2008-09 has resurrected interest in the special drawing right as an international reserve currency. In this paper, we argue that the SDR fails to meet the main attributes of an international reserve currency — deep and liquid markets, supported by currency convertibility; wide use internationally; macroeconomic and political stability in the issuing country. At this juncture, the critical mass of political will to invest the International Monetary Fund with these responsibilities simply does not exist and/or will take a long time to form. Despite shocks and sometimes acute differences in views on the US dollar, the current system has been resilient over decades, and is likely to remain so for some more years.||C RANGARAJAN,MICHAEL DEBABRATA PATRA

This paper is based on a study of a minor irrigation project in the semi-arid Udaipur district of Rajasthan, where the livelihoods of people in the watershed are dependent on canal water and there are serious inequalities in the distribution of water within and between villages. This study points to both the social and spatial dimensions of inequalities in access to water. It also focuses on governance arrangements and highlights inequalities that arise from the delegation of management of water systems to communities.

This paper traces some of the challenges posed by the new communications technologies and the variegated field of media practices to argue that the fragmented media policy framework requires a complete makeover in terms of its regulatory objectives, strategies and public media obligations. Emphasising the need for incorporating anthropological and technologically informed perspectives on the nature and implications of current media expansion, the paper proposes that the policy framework should include a modular and unbundled approach to media regulation. Policymakers should also invest research energy into the exercise of mapping the diversity of media practices and multiple logics driving rapid proliferation of media across the country. In the context of growing state practices of surveillance and staggered acquiescence to corporate interests, policy interventions should move beyond the contradictory impulses of "policing" the media and media-enabled development to craft innovative ways of leveraging the benefits of current media architecture as well as several recent legal provisions aimed at enhancing the capacity of public information.||SAHANA UDUPA

The results from this study indicate that the "positive private effect" or the private-public performance gap does vary based on the village context. The private school advantage is reduced in villages with a strong government presence. This government presence in the data is reflected in the provision of various government services, the presence of physical infrastructure, and a robust government-funded and government-supported primary, middle and secondary education system. Public and private schools are not established and do not operate in a vacuum. Public schools may respond to private competition, or they may simply respond to greater government support. Private schools similarly also respond to the presence of robust government-funded services and infrastructure.||AMITA CHUDGAR

This paper seeks to understand the significance of this conjuncture in the context of larger debates around the disciplinary reassessment of tribal studies in contemporary India. By focusing closely on the implications of framing the Andaman islanders within the discourse of "indigeneity", this paper explores the possibilities opened up by the ongoing conversations in the field of adivasi studies.||VISHVAJIT PANDYA,MADHUMITA MAZUMDAR

The incident was fuelled, on the one hand, by the dalit desire for self-respect and identity, embodied in the increasing assertion of a female dalit sarpanch, and on the other, by the state-level political advancement of the backward caste Kapu community. Particularly disturbing are the participation of Kapu women and children in the killings, and the failure of dalit officials and politicians in preventing the incident and securing justice for the victims.||

Limiting the participation of people to voting once in five years makes the elected representatives unresponsive to the people who have elected them. Initiatives and referendums provide a political mechanism to ensure that citizens' voices can provide a counterbalance to a legislature unresponsive to peoples' interests. They are instruments of direct democracy in which people vote directly on issues of policy and lawmaking. These instruments, however, are not meant to replace representative democracy, but to complement it and to help maintain its responsiveness to the people.||PRASHANT BHUSHAN,ATISHI MARLENA

It conclusively demonstrates that the poorer sections of households in intervention districts of the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna, Rajiv Aarogyasri of Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu Health Insurance schemes experienced a rise in real per capita healthcare expenditure, particularly on hospitalisation, and an increase in catastrophic headcount — conclusive proof that RSBY and other state government-based interventions failed to provide financial risk protection. Therefore, the policy that is needed would aim to achieve universal health coverage of the population, moving away from the current trend of piecemeal, fragmented approaches, to providing a thrust for primary health care.||SAKTHIVEL SELVARAJ,ANUP K KARAN

The estimates indicate that the reductions in agricultural tariff rates will lead to an increase in India's imports of agricultural products by about 1% and an increase in its exports of agricultural products to the US and US markets by about 2% to 4%. India has probably more to gain from the implementation of tariff cuts according to the tiered formula than to lose from it. However, the overall effect of the tariff cuts on India's agricultural exports and domestic agricultural production would be small.||BISHWANATH GOLDAR,DEVENDER PRATAP,YASHOBANTA PARIDA

The literature points to two crucial aspects of the lived reality of the urban informal sector: the network of social relationships and property rights. This article investigates the manner in which the two interact to determine earning opportunities in the urban informal sector. The study is based on a sample of informal sector paanwalas or retail paan shops across Mumbai. We point out the significant role continuous access to physical space, the arena where property rights and social capital interface, plays in determining earnings.||ABODH KUMAR,RAJANI MATHUR,NEERAJ HATEKAR

8/12/2012- ||special article||41720440||The Quality of Governance: How Have Indian States Performed?||There is a core concept of good governance, the combination of authority and responsibility to pursue the common good, that has remained stable over millennia. Building on this concept the paper develops several indices of the quality of governance and applies these indices to rank major states in India. The governance indices have been derived from the three main pillars of the government, i e, the legislature, the judiciary and the executive. Performance on each dimension of governance has been measured using indicators that are all based exclusively on factual data, not perceptions. The paper shows that there is a strong correlation between governance quality and the level of development in a state. When we correct for the effect of development on the quality of governance, it turns out that some of the poorer states significantly improve their rank, implying their governance performance is much better than would be expected at their level of development.||SUDIPTO MUNDLE,PINAKI CHAKRABORTY,SAMIK CHOWDHURY,SATADRU SIKDAR

However, it needs to be recognised that caste is one of the central categories that frames environmental politics. Dalit thinkers, organisations and movements have had a wider perspective and critique of environmental articulations that require deeper investigation. On the one hand, we see a caste-blindness in current environmental politics. On the other, we see dalit views on Indian environmentalism, reflected in their works, words and movements in different parts of the country. This brings forth not only new dimensions on both environment and dalits, but also helps us in redefining certain key categories such as development, modernity, community, livelihood and social movements.||MUKUL SHARMA

The changes in poverty and growth in MPCE have been measured for major socio-religious and economic groups in both rural and urban sectors. This is complemented by the decomposition of the change in the incidence of poverty into the growth and distribution components. The results indicate that the poverty rate has declined at an accelerated rate during 2004-05 - 2009-10 for all socio-religious household groups. Growth has been more poverty reducing at an aggregate level during the period 2004-05 - 2009-10 as compared to 1993-94 - 2004-05. However, some groups benefited more than the others from poverty reduction. Inequality has also begun to adversely affect poverty reduction, particularly in the urban sector.||SUKHADEO THORAT,AMARESH DUBEY

Within two decades caste had come to stay in public discourse. The Emergency of 1975-77 and its aftermath were turning points in the public acknowledgement of the continuing significance of caste. It began to be argued that far from being antithetical to democracy, caste had an essential part to play in the advancement of democracy in India. In course of time the media took up the argument for the salience of caste in Indian society and this has now become almost a part of the conventional wisdom. However, there is evidence to show that caste is in fact losing its strength in India, though not uniformly or dramatically. With the media giving a sensational turn to caste in its daily coverage, the long-term changes in caste are being ignored.||ANDRÉ BÉTEILLE

The OBC discourse on reservations has de-stigmatised policy; OBCS have also articulated their demands beyond community concerns by bringing up issues related to regionalism and linguistic assertion.

Counterclaims of Bt cotton failure are attributed to mutually reinforcing interactions among non-governmental organisations which avoid rigorous comparisons. However, researchers and the biotechnology industry are also engaged in a similar authentication loop for generating, validating, and publicising such facts. With Bt cotton, the convention of routinely ignoring the effects of selection bias and cultivation bias benefits researchers, journals and the industry, but keeps us from drawing meaningful conclusions about the relative performance of the technology. But as poor as the case for isolating the technology impact of Bt cotton in India has been, it is useful in helping us understand the social conventions for creating one's "own facts".||GLENN DAVIS STONE

Thus, besides the different histories mediated by caste and community, the spatial location of women leaders in local governance appears to be of central importance in shaping their agency. This article which is based on the research about women leaders in local governance in Kerala in 2005-10 explores the extent to which success in local governance allowed these women entry into politics and gave them a greater presence within the public life. Generally it is seen that successful women leaders are often the bearers of a specific form of power that has been historically associated with the deployment of sentiment and affect, and ideal femininity, and that such power is understood to be crucial to local governance as well. However, an entirely different picture emerged from this study on women leaders of urban governance. Besides gentle power, successful women attribute their success equally to knowledge — of official norms and procedures.||J DEVIKA,BINITHA V THAMPI

The contributions of international migrants to their home countries in the form of remittances, investments, and philanthropic donations are widely regarded as an important development resource. This paper reviews the migration and development debate and the current state of knowledge about flows of migrant resources to India and argues that tracing transnational connections and flows at the regional level will provide a more nuanced understanding of their social and economic implications.||CAROL UPADHYA,MARIO RUTTEN

In mathematical economics there seems to be an increasing identification of Debreu's mathematisation of economics with Bourbakism, although the post-second world war mathematics of general equilibrium theory can be shown to be consistent also with the contributions of the Polish School of Mathematics in the interwar period. In this paper an attempt is made to summarise the story of the emergence of Bourbakism, originating in India, and its recent demise as well as how it played a destructive role in mathematising economics in one, uncompromisingly non-constructive, mode.||K VELA VELUPILLAI

This article revisits the events ofthat year to examine the displacement/migration question. Taking a cue from Hannah Arendt it argues that displacement raises the larger question of guaranteeing the rights of minorities against majoritarian impulses and examines the proposed Prevention of Communal and Targeted Violence (Access to Justice and Reparations) Bill, 2011 in this light.||SANJEEVINI BADIGAR

The regional parties, in order to expand their core constituencies, have been compelled to revise their electoral strategies in economic rather than merely caste terms. This trend has disturbed and reconfigured the traditional caste categories which in elections normally form economic constituencies.

Urgent reforms are needed to address these inadequacies and check the excesses of middlemen. While encouraging new models that improve the bargaining power of producers and scaling up successful experiments, producers' companies and cooperative marketing societies could be promoted to provide alternative avenues for sale of produce. Meanwhile, price policy has to be reoriented to bring it in tune with the emerging demand and supply of various crops. Though the private sector is vital to improving efficiency, the public sector is equally essential to serve the larger social goal of maintaining price stability through market operations.||RAMESH CHAND

This refusal is revealed in the negative opinions, especially of women who run away to marry out of their caste. The underlying beliefs in "equality of all" and "humanism" which seem to give a lot of these women the courage to break free of caste and marry the men of their choice, are not given any credence. This paper, based on fieldwork in Punjab, argues that such views are based less on fact and more on prejudice – the "seen-unseen" – letting a silent revolution go unnoticed.||MEENA DHANDA

While forced displacement affects both men and women, women experience displacement and relocation in a particularly gendered way. This differential impact on women occurs due to the gendered division of labour that has arisen from socio-historical processes of men's traditional incorporation in the wage-earning and labour-oriented tasks while women remain on the land jobs and its management on a daily basis. Resettlement and rehabilitation policies expose the male biases inherent in the insensitivity of the governments towards needs of women. This paper examines the lived experiences of displaced women based on the empirical findings of research that looks at women displaced by the construction of the Tehri Dam and their relocation elsewhere.||VANDANA ASTHANA

Those who sell diagnostic and clinical services make an immediate profit, while the users buy only imagined futures. Within the logic of marital/natal "propertarianism", the eradication of one form of "property" -the female foetus -is believed to save other forms. This marks a patriarchal reorganisation of reproduction. This essay discusses the interlocking relation of sex selection and dowry predicated on a peculiar "propertarianism" and the logic of domestic violence. Sex selection is, in part, rationalised through cost and benefit that takes the shape of common sense, but is suffused with contradictions. It produces not national agents, but future imaginaries, paradoxes and contradictions that may not culminate in desired resolutions.||KUMKUM SANGARI

Scientists, medical doctors, health staff and community workers make heroic efforts but the innovative potential of India remains underused. This limits flexible responses to changing challenges and opportunities - such as, for example, increasing multidrug resistance, co-infection with HIV, migration, new global health actors and funds, progress in technology — that TB control is faced with. More innovation and innovations of a different kind than new diagnostics, drugs or vaccines are possible and necessary. In order to strengthen innovative capacity, it helps to understand the efforts of coping with TB in India as a continuous struggle for innovation and control. Understanding this struggle and then strengthening the mechanisms to balance different practices of innovation and control are crucial for the future of TB control in India. Such understanding and experimentations would also offer instances of learning about how to improve TB control to other countries and to the World Health Organisation's global efforts.||NORA ENGEL,WIEBE BIJKER

Instead of a linear migration out of weaving into other forms of livelihood, weaving communities show a more strategic mobility — flexibly departing from and again returning to weaving, depending on circumstances. This mobility can be traced in weavers' discourses about their vulnerabilities and aspirations. This paper shows that the standard image of weaving as premodern, unproductive and unsustainable is produced by being trapped in a progress discourse, a poverty discourse, and a market discourse. An alternative view of handloom weaving as a socio-technology is proposed: understanding handloom as an ensemble of knowledge, skills, technology and social relations explains the continued sustainability of handloom, and also offers clues for socio-technical innovation and an alleviation of vulnerabilities.||ANNAPURNA MAMIDIPUDI,SYAMASUNDARI B,WIEBE BIJKER

It moves away from the register of "choice" and "consent" and focuses on the question of intermediation. Social and technological changes have altered existing institutions of intermediation and created new ones, even as changes in matchmaking have both responded and contributed to the development of the "arranged love marriage" system. The seemingly dramatic transformation in forms and institutions of intermediation has nevertheless kept intact or even reinforced both caste and class configurations within the marriage market as well as gender stereotypes in the choice of bride/groom.

Chennai's premier resettlement colony, Kannagi Nagar, housing slum-dwellers evicted from the city since 2000 has integrated itself into the industrial, commercial and software economies of the information technology corridor on unfavourable terms, swelling the supply of unskilled casual workers for local firms. This article highlights, from the vantage point of workers in the resettlement colony, how the restructuring processes of large formal sector companies within the "new economy" exploit conditions created by the state's slum clearance policies, to enhance the precariousness of work for residents ofresettlementsites. lt highlights issues of quality of work for casual workers in the formal sector and their role in the production, persistence and reproduction of working poverty. It thereby illustrates how the restructuring of urban space by new imperatives of urban capital, through the peripheralisation of both industrial establishments and working classes, creates new socio-spatial configurations of work and poverty.||KAREN COELHO,T VENKAT,R CHANDRIKA

The embedding of violence in Karachi's politics makes it difficult for the city's residents to even imagine a more peaceful future. This paper analyses the history of violence in Karachi, which started on the city's campuses at the end of the 1970s, before escalating in the mid-1980s after criminal groups provoked "ethnic riots" between Pathans and mohajirs. These "riots" infused a sense of insecurity among the Urdu-speaking mohajirs, which paved the way for the Mohajir Qaumi Movement's rise at the helm of city politics. Once in power, this study explains, instead of mending its violent ways, the MQM systematised a form of violent government, later on emulated by its rivals, which was meant to ensure its domination over mohajirs, as much as to counter its political adversaries.||LAURENT GAYER

While the heaviest sentences have been handed down in cases where Hindus in Godhra had been victims of violence, a very large number of cases have been closed before prosecution and many others remain pending, with only a handful completed or near completion. The reasons for this failure of the rule of law -whose magnitude will have to be qualified since proceedings are still under way -lie in the grip that Hindu nationalism (as an ideology and a political movement) holds over the state machinery (including the police and the judiciary) in Gujarat and the central authority's relative powerlessness (both at the executive and judicial level) to counteract it. This is so despite the repeated attempts that the Supreme Court has made (including the appointment of the Special Investigation Team), and the activism of non-governmental organisations and some mediapersons.||CHRISTOPHE JAFFRELOT

As in India, neither the US executive nor the judiciary seemed capable of withstanding pressures exerted by the chemical processing industry. This is an ongoing story of struggle. What gave Bhopal a fresh salience in the public mind was the Indian government's proposal to buy nuclear power reactors from the US, and to agree to legislation which would satisfy US manufacturers of the limits to their liability. Disconcertingly for the government, the Bhopal chief judicial magistrate's judgment in 2010 led to an explosion of public fury, forcing the government to introduce clauses in the nuclear liability legislation laying down responsibility on the technology supplier.

It was fought against the exploitative design of ecosystem governance under the taungya method of artificial regeneration as invented by colonial foresters during the British rule. The movement is historic and mostly relevant in its radical gesture against ecological exploitation through inclusive technique of community involvement in the top-down management of forest resources.||SOURISH JHA

It is the relatively more developed and urbanised region of north-central Punjab, traditionally a core political region of the country, that is now the main base of the opposition. But if the future of parliamentary democracy in Pakistan seems more certain now than at any time in recent history it is because the centre of political gravity has moved down to the provinces and regions, and at the local level it is the Pakistan People's Party that has a strong base.||HARIS GAZDAR

However, interpretations of both religion and corruption are extremely diverse. Notwithstanding the existence of deep-seated faith with strong moral values, religion is not seen as contributing to the moral or spiritual fabric of the nation in present times, while corruption is regarded as pervasive. Very few of the respondents canvassed in this study thought that we should count on religion to make a difference in people's general attitudes towards corruption. Respondents indicated that their confidence in the accountability of religious organisations is low, and it is therefore problematic to assume that religious organisations are likely to be either appropriate or effective vehicles for fighting corruption. In fact, religion is looked upon as a discredited entity by many, largely due to a sense of popular disillusionment with its "caretakers".||VINOD PAVARALA,KANCHAN K MALIK

Especially in the latter, not only is the overall perception of resources like land distinct from non-tribal areas but even the role of women is much more dominant both inside and outside the home. In giving emphasis to cash rather than land as compensation and zeroing in on the male as the head of the household among other provisions, the Bill lays the groundwork for the destruction of these societies.||MUDUNURI BHARATHI

Their growing importance is a response to the structural changes in the larger economy and the contextual constraints on agriculture in the region. It posits that this phenomenon represents an inflection in the trajectory of agricultural growth in the region because of three distinct features. First, the new commodity complexes have strong links to agribusinesses and global markets. Second, downstream players exert an unprecedented influence and control over production practices. Third, the need for control over quality demands particular transactional forms such as contract farming. The paper argues that despite some economic gain, challenges of a different kind emerge and the normative implications of these changes are as yet unclear.||SUDHA NARAYANAN

This is both ethically defensible and strategically wise. Ironically, India's own domestic national approach of actively exploring "co-benefits" - policies that promote development while also yielding climate gains - suggests that it does take climate science seriously and has embraced responsibility as duty. However, by focusing on articulating rigid principles rather than building on actual policies and actions, it only weakens its own position.||NAVROZ K DUBASH

It examines contract farming arrangements to show the exclusion of small producers from the retail chain; the performance of modern (supermarket) food retail chains in India and their spread and penetration into, or interface with, farmers; policy and regulatory issues; and some of the mechanisms and institutional innovations for more inclusive agricultural marketing systems.||SUKHPAL SINGH

Highlighted here are the roles played by the architectural consultancy, city administrators and political managers, as well as community groups, civil society and academic institutions. The efficiency of the administration showed an active anti-poor stance in the court proceedings and in the violence of actual evictions and post-eviction suffering.

Problems of market failures in the provisioning of private and public goods are known. Less discussed are Scitovskian "double market failures", where neither government nor market can create and sustain institutionalities for safe, secure and reliable transactions due to pecuniary externalities. The most problematic are situations where concern for inclusive growth coexists with exclusive appropriations over long periods and problems defy solutions, being neither cyclic nor structural. This paper cites evidence from precisely such a breakdown in Manipur to examine this third category of systemic failures which are "treble failures" characterising situations where a nexus of stakeholding contracts to underpin strategy is infeasible, fragile or highly vulnerable.||AJEET N MATHUR

The new policy paradigm speaks the language of inclusiveness and efficiency, but its outcome has been far from ideal. This study examines two housing projects in Bengaluru to reveal how core elements of the new programme drive inconsistencies, even distortions, on the ground, impinging on the urban local body's ability to deliver on the ambitious aim of providing affordable housing in sizeable numbers. It argues that the new approach to housing projects is overlaid on the conventional "public housing built by contractors chosen by tender" framework and this poses fresh challenges to already beleaguered local bodies.||LALITHA KAMATH

This paper uses a case study of the Supreme Courtordered sealing drives of 2006-07 to investigate how these traders were threatened by eviction dynamics earlier experienced by slum-dwellers and small-scale industrialists. Trader groups, thus, must be included within narratives of displacement despite being deeply enmeshed in the growth of the "world-class" city and lifestyles. This paper examines how a dispersed trader presence located across the city became a citywide protesting public and the multiple political strategies it used in coalescing public opposition.||DIYA MEHRA

It turns out that per capita cereal consumption remains much the same at different levels of per capita income, though it does vary substantially with education levels, household size, occupation patterns and urbanisation. The recent decline of cereal consumption overtime may reflect changes in these non-income factors. While cereal consumption seems unrelated to per capita income, it is positively related to per capita expenditure. Possible interpretations of this contrast are briefly discussed.||CHRISTIAN OLDIGES

Commentators and scholars have tended to attribute this crisis of the agrarian economy to larger processes at work, particularly to globalisation and the new policies of economic reforms initiated by India during the early years of the 1990s. While there may be some truth in these explanations, the framing of the "agrarian", "rural" question in this discourse presents the complex and diverse rural realities in simplistic and populist terms. Such a discourse also invokes a sectoral policy response, where agriculture as a sector is seen as needing state attention, and ignores the internal dynamics of changing caste and class relations on the ground. Based on a revisit to two villages of Haryana, this paper provides a brief account of the changing nature of class relations in a post-green revolution rural setting with a specific focus on the changing nature of attached and "unfree" labour.||SURINDER S JODHKA

The question of the nature and structure of the agency for administering and collecting the GST is one of the most crucial ones. It appears that the existing institutional and organisational structure with multiple departments (one at the union and one in each of the states) would be maintained for collection of what is essentially a single tax (though with two components), thereby severely eroding most of the expected benefits of a national GST as well as putting a heavy burden on taxpayers. The influence of the bureaucratic complex and power politics of the organised civil services as well as a lack of political will are the major reasons for such a possible outcome. The need is to move towards a harmonised, modern and professionally managed national revenue agency for GST with a proper safeguard mechanism for preserving the fiscal federal nature of India and its states.||PRAVEEN KISHORE

In this context, this paper makes a case for the concerted development of small and medium cities as the key focus in the strategy to ensure sustainable urbanisation in India. As cities plan for the long term, among the most critical components they need are the availability of land and the provision of infrastructure and services for a growing population. This paper suggests the need for land banks and land readjustment mechanisms, and assesses the efficacy of current mechanisms for infrastructure provision in small and medium cities. There is also a rationale and need for the creation of new cities, either on the peripheries of large cities or around industrial clusters, with private participation and financing.||ANAND SAHASRANAMAN

Since such a change could threaten the security of food and other agrarian supplies, this paper focuses on biodiesel production from jatropha oilseeds, assessing the profitability and competitiveness of energy cultivation and the chances of it replacing food or cash crop cultivation.||ROBIN SINGHAL,RAMPRASAD SENGUPTA

Based on an analysis of three villages in Tamil Nadu, this paper argues that many gram panchayats are today in a position to substantially finance themselves and build a culture of self-sufficiency, independence and accountability to their citizens, reducing their dependence on devolutions from state governments.

This attempt at prior restraint on the media is a dangerous move with precedent from authoritarian polities. In a context where the judiciary has been lax in defending the media from attacks which seek to curb its freedom, such unilateral moves will not remedy bad reporting but rather make conditions worse for the media to play its role. The way to cure the ills of a media corralled within corporate and political interests is to give it greater freedom from curbs.||SUKUMAR MURALIDHARAN

It highlights the phenomenon of pluralism within religions, arguing that subtle differences often exist in how different branches of one tradition relate to and express concepts of rights and equality. In this regard we present two case studies: in Dharamsala, Tibetan Buddhists are embedded in a struggle for national freedom, while in Pune, the sociopolitical context of caste means that dalit people have sought to find a coherent strategy to fight the injustices they suffer. In Pune, Navayana Buddhism provides a practical system of morality which supports a strong sense of social justice and human dignity, underpinning political action. In Dharamsala, Tibetan interpretations of spirituality bolster welfare activity, but do not lend themselves well to the struggle for Tibetan sovereignty.||ZARA BHATEWARA,TAMSIN BRADLEY

Since a meta-analysis of studies can give only partial conclusions, owing to differences across study methodologies and coverage, this paper takes a different strategy, i e, looking not simply at differences between Bt farms and non-Bt farms, but at the experience of farmers before growing Bt and after switching to Bt. It also examines the more general problem of comparing field studies and suggests ways to use farmer behaviour as a proxy for settling different interpretations of agro-economic effects of the new technology. The study explains why there has been so much controversy given virtually universal adoption of Bt technology in cotton and concludes that in the battle of numbers around Bt cotton, those of the farmers have been curiously missing.||RONALD J HERRING,N CHANDRASEKHARA RAO

The opposition has been about riding roughshod over the concerns of some ministries. But the NIB proposal also throws up larger issues. Has India's economic growth really meant "development" in the true sense of the word, and how sustainable and equitable is it? Measures like the NIB may well help in taking the growth rate a notch up, but is this necessarily good?

In the meanwhile, the clamour for "compromise" and for "moving on" often come to dominate public discourse. This article, based on a decade-long intense involvement with the relief and rehabilitation of the victims of the 2002 Gujarat killings, tries to understand what motivates the victims to agree to such "compromises" with the perpetrators of violence on them. It identifies various forms of inducement, coercion, fatigue and despair as probable reasons. It argues that forgiveness can only happen when the victim is empowered enough to decide but in our context, such acts merely hide the victims' inability to receive justice.||HARSH MANDER

Based on worker interviews, this two-part article (Part é appeared last week) throws light on labour relations in an auto production chain of lead and subcontracting companies in Delhi National Capital Region.

The resulting bride shortages in female deficit regions and countries have led to the "import" of women from areas with better sex ratios. The paper explores this "import" of brides from West Bengal and Bangladesh, and unravels the differences in the marital experience of cross-national and cross-regional Bengali brides. Focusing on issues of citizenship and religion, and how they affect these women and their children from such marriages, it calls for the provision of meaningful support structures for such brides, the first step towards which would be to acknowledge the growing volume of female deficit-induced cross-region marriages.||RAVINDER KAUR

These deficiencies include limited product coverage, competitive need limitations, discretionary decision-making on specific aspects, requirements of reciprocity and the existence of parallel unilateral preferential schemes. Additionally, the reduction in most favoured nation tariffs after successive rounds of multilateral trade negotiations has eroded the margin of preference and diminished the value of these concessions. As a consequence, preferences under the system will largely pass into an era of near irrelevance. Despite the gloomy outlook at present, it would be worthwhile to persevere with the system rather than make futile attempts to convince the United States of the need to make far-reaching improvements in its unilateral preferences.||ANWARUL HODA,SHRAVANI PRAKASH

In Pakistan, absolute learning is low and the largest gaps are between good and bad government schools. The gap between children with literate and illiterate mothers is huge. Tested at the end of Grade 3, a bare majority of children have mastered the K-1 mathematics curriculum and only 31% can correctly form a sentence with the word "school" in Urdu. The gap in English test-scores between government and private schools is 12 times the gap between children from rich and poor families.

The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and other extraordinary legislations such as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act are seemingly "protective" legislations which were put forward by states as necessary for security. In fact, they have been violative of the basic human rights of people in the areas where they are in force. A small group of women activists have initiated a discussion on these extraordinary laws of south Asia which function to create some sort of consent to formal obstructions to justice, and thereby, create a much wider culture of impunity.||NAVSHARAN SINGH,URVASHI BUTALIA

Statehood in 1972 was followed by half-hearted attempts at industrialisation and irrigation that were swept away by the liberalisation of the 1990s. Central agencies such as the North East Council and the Ministry of Development of North Eastern Region have failed to fulfil their roles as catalysts for development. Manipur is now a dependent state that serves as a captive market for products from the rest of India. Bolstered by the huge inflow of central funds for infrastructural development, its economy is a purely monetary phenomenon, which in reality has no leg to stand on.||HANJABAM ISWORCHANDRA SHARMA

This paper examines the extensive social welfare network of the Jama'at-i-Islami, the largest Islamic political party in Pakistan and Bangladesh, and finds this voter-centric explanation inadequate. Instead, it argues, such investment serves a more fundamental purpose, that of establishing the religious identity of the party. It further shows that religious political parties plan strategically to balance their religious commitment and practical survival needs: the welfare programmes implemented by the Jama'at in the two countries differ to accommodate the socio-economic and political peculiarities of each context. Why the Jama'at, especially in Pakistan, fails to translate this extensive welfare work into securing more seats in parliament is a question worthy of further investigation. The answer possibly rests in the limited enthusiasm of the Pakistani public for a society based on the shariah.||MASOODA BANO

Landscape urbanism has not contributed to social justice, political emancipation, or ecologically saner designs, as its proponents have argued. Instead, while small privately developed parks like the High Line have cornered most resources flowing to New York's parklands, far larger parks in poorer areas face a decline due to dwindling public investment.||LEON A MORENAS

Anger at the plant had been building up for months over the management's refusal to recognise an elected union; workers were increasingly frustrated over their inability to exercise their constitutional rights and the demand of equal pay for equal work was falling on deaf ears.

One fundamental issue is the increasing inequality in wealth and control over human resources, globally and in south Asia. Economic policy regimes in the contemporary world resemble those of laissez-faire imperalism of a century ago more than national state planning regimes that prevailed from the 1950s into the 1980s. It is argued that the long histories of imperial modernity have organised the world of capitalism in which nationalism has carried the inequity of empire into the heart and soul of south Asia.||DAVID LUDDEN

It was feared that firms would shift from indigenous production to imports, especially of bulk drugs, and this concern was aggravated with the change in the patent law. This paper finds that these apprehensions have only partly come true. Exports of formulations have grown faster while their imports have not registered any jump, keeping the balance of trade positive. But there has been a decline in domestic production of bulk drugs and a growth in imports because the industry is moving away from intermediates and is focusing on bulk drugs at the high end of the value chain.||REJI K JOSEPH

The paper engages with the gendering of citizenship and sovereignty through a comparison of the state policy on migrant women workers and the experience of three segments of this workforce – emigrant nurses, domestic workers and outmigrant fish processing workers. It then considers the question of agency in the context of women workers who are thrust into the position of breadwinners for their families and, finally, the question of responsible state intervention.||PRAVEENA KODOTH,V J VARGHESE

It also presents historical case studies of Germany and Japan, which show that government intervention in the financial sector was rife in the early years and proved critical in shaping the size and role of stock markets in their economies. Besides, these case studies do not show that equity funding flourishes when governments adopt a hands-off approach towards the financial system.||VINEET KOHLI

Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Bihar since 2002, it reveals the role of brokers within both village power relations and the larger political system. This analysis implies that, in addition to the institutional reforms that are currently at the centre of public debate, tackling corruption in everyday state administration would require wide-reaching sociopolitical transformations and massive investments in basic state capacity.||JEFFREY WITSOE

No political organisation in the state, whether left or right, has really been able to contest the hegemony of the image of the bhadralok which has its roots in the upper caste and Victorian moralities. Dress is one critical marker of the bhadralok and this is therefore also a field where bhadralok politics is practised. The dominant cultural ethos is most importantly transmitted through educational institutions. So a dress code in educational institutions is not only important but becomes a moral force. The silence within the women's movement on this issue is also noteworthy.||SHOMA CHOUDHURY LAHIRI,SARBANI BANDYOPADHYAY

From sharing an occupational class identity, the weavers mobilised and asserted themselves as a caste group, seeking special recognition as Momins or Ansaris within a broader Muslim identity. The multiple axes around which their identities had to be asserted and negotiated lend a special character to their political articulation. Yet due to both the complexities of religious dichotomies and local exigencies, the All India Momin Conference could not lend effective voice to a counter-hegemonic stance in Indian Muslim politics. This paper documents the multiple ways in which the politics of weavers unfolded in early 20th century United Provinces.||SANTOSH KUMAR RAI

Bettaleseve is a form of worship rendered to goddess Renukamba at Chandragutti. It ran into major controversy in 1986 when the Dalit Sangharsh Samiti, some women's groups and non-governmental organisations protested against the "nudity" of dalit-bahujan women who comprise the majority of worshippers. The article examines the subject produced in the protest discourse and proposes another reading of the subject through a return to the Renukamba myth that underpins and is played out during bettaleseve. It explores whether the myth can be read as a body of knowledge-practice that provides an alternate basis to articulate the dalit woman's standpoint.||P RADHIKA

Can we reflect on the right not to be poor without taking on these background inequalities? Arguably, the right not to be poor is best articulated as a subset of the generic right to equality. The concept of equality is, however, not self-explanatory. In many circles, redistributive justice has replaced equality. It is therefore time to ask the question — equality for what? Is equality only about the provision of minimal resources, or is it about enabling a sense of self-worth so that people can participate in the multiple transactions of society with a degree of confidence? Unless we are careful about the way we approach the poverty debate, we will land up not with equality, but with "sufficientarianism".||NEERA CHANDHOKE

Empirical evidence from most of these countries however indicates that the neo-liberal policies have not been very successful in including the excluded in the mainstream development process. The paper observes that there is an urgent need to give a fresh look at the macroeconomic framework underlying the present policies. To start with, there is a need to end the tug of war between the growth and redistribution phases of neo-liberal policies. This is because the mainstream growth process that creates exclusion as well as inequalities tends to overpower the redistribution process and intensifies exclusions. The macroeconomic policies such as fiscal and monetary policies will have to play a much larger role in achieving developmental goals. There is also a need to expand the boundaries of macroeconomics to include natural resources as well as unpaid work within its purview to make it relevant and real.||INDIRA HIRWAY

An appreciation of the synergies and trade-offs between ecosystem services is equally important to develop better strategies for pro-poor ecosystem management. If the distributional outcomes associated with alternative options for natural resource management are neglected, there is a risk that such interventions may fail because of resistance from those who are excluded or those who stand to lose.||BHASKAR VIRA,BILL ADAMS,CHETAN AGARWAL,SHRINIVAS BADIGER,R A HOPE,JAGDISH KRISHNASWAMY,CHETAN KUMAR

A study of the Kerala Medical Services Corporation and Odisha's State Drug Management Unit shows that imitating the original model without factoring in the local context and building up the processes does not lead to success. While Kerala has adapted the Tamil Nadu model and even added innovations, Odisha's experiment has had dismal results.||PRABAL VIKRAM SINGH,ANAND TATAMBHOTLA,ROHINI RAO KALVAKUNTLA,MAULIK CHOKSHI

The CPI(M)'S empiricisation - not revisionism - has resulted in setbacks, and it has to strive to build a coalition of the workers and peasants to resist international finance capital and, where in power, usher in an alternate trajectory of development.||PRABHAT PATNAIK

28/1/2012- ||commentary||41419759||Anti-Dowry Law Viewed from the Prison Cell||The "other side" of the dowry deaths story is not so familiar. What is the relevance of the anti-dowry law which puts the burden of proof on the defence, rather than the prosecution, in regions and states where the practice of dowry is not believed to be rampant? There is need for radical socio-economic transformation rather than legalistic remedies to the problem of atrocities on married women. The fate of families embroiled in the conflict over alleged dowry deaths is examined from within the four walls of the women's prison cell, without losing sight of the prevailing patriarchal-feudal values and attitudes in the society.||CHANDRAKALA

It appears that the internal and external turmoil experienced by states and the waxing and waning of ideologies have influenced the disciplinary concerns of researchers. Has this influenced a widening or closeting of the horizons of knowledge creation and its correlate, the tools of enquiry? What kinds of texts are popularly used? How useful are they for the developing world?||BONITA ALEAZ

19/5/2012- ||perspectives||23214625||India Inc. and Its Moral Discontents||When and how did corruption become the most urgent crisis facing the Indian nation? This question is yet to be addressed adequately in the ongoing debates on corruption in India. This article turns its attention to the role of India Inc. in shaping the anti-corruption movement which coalesced around popular discontent successfully harnessed by civil society organisations and big corporations with ideological support of global financial institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. It argues that the moral panic about the lowered levels of ethical values in society is no longer merely a matter of individual integrity and concern. The urgent actions stem from the belief that corruption has a severe economic meaning for the nation especially to its brand image in the world as an "attractive investment destination". The fear of losing investments underpins the active participation of corporate players in the anti-corruption movement.||RAVINDER KAUR

However, what the ruling does is favour tax avoidance strategies. Indeed, it goes against the Supreme Court's own ruling in 1986 in opposition to such strategies.||PRASHANT BHUSHAN

A large number of Delhi's residents live in such unauthorised colonies, most of which are now being regularised. But just how many people, and what changes for them through regularisation? This process does not come without preconditions, spelled out through an emphasis on self-enumeration as well as the mandatory formation of resident welfare associations during the application for legal status. Analysing these procedures, this article argues that greater inclusiveness is offered only to those who adhere to a new meaning of citizenship, focusing on residents' active and financial participation in development and governance.||ANNA ZIMMER

While he and a few thus jailed received media attention, there are many who are rotting in jails, accused of being Maoists and tortured. Many of them have denied being Maoists but that is not the point. The Maoists, after all, are responding to the deceit and violence of the state in their chosen way.||ANAND TELTUMBDE

It is wrong, as in the coal blocks and other recent cases, to cast aspersions on the CAG for pointing out the omissions and commissions of the government. The office of the CAG has done what it is expected to do as a guardian of national finance. Unfortunately the issue has got politicised with the leading opposition party upping the ante. The recent CAG'S reports will have served their purpose if attention is drawn to some critical policy issues on the role and conduct of private sector in infrastructure development.||B P MATHUR

The region has had a long history of being marginalised; its inclusion in the Indian nation is seriously challenged by communities; and identity politics has shaped the politics of resistance. The struggle for power, both political and economic, has thus become bloodied. What lies behind the recent violence in Assam? The failure of the Sixth Schedule to deliver, the contest over land and resources, the lack of development, and the fear of disempowered smaller groups are all tangled in the web of electoral politics of the ruling classes.||SURYASIKHA PATHAK
10/3/2012- ||insight||41419931||Rise and Fall of Calcutta's Group Theatre: The End of a Political Dream||There is good reason to believe that there were telltale signs in West Bengal even in the late 1970s, at the moment of the left's greatest triumph, that there was something intrinsically wrong in the process through which the left had come to power and retained it. This article attempts to establish this through a brief examination of Calcutta's Group Theatre movement, which since its inception was largely driven by left-democratic ideals. A strong movement in the 1960s, by the 1980s it had begun to fade away. It is possible to see the crisis in the Group Theatre movement as a fallout of the much bigger crisis in the constitutional left movement of the country.||PARIMAL GHOSH

While the report as a whole and this chapter make several sound suggestions, what comes through is that much more could have been done. In the absence of a gender and health analysis framework, the report tends to address gender issues in an ad hoc and uneven fashion.||T K SUNDARI RAVINDRAN,MANJU R NAIR

Of these, the Social Health Insurance scheme for private sector employees has been run on a capitation contract model since 1991. The Universal Coverage Scheme followed its example, with capitation payments for outpatient services and a global budget with diagnosis-related group-based payments for inpatient care. There are several arguments in favour of this closed-end payment system such as administrative simplicity, efficiency, prevention of supplier-induced demand and long-term cost containment.||VIROJ TANGCHAROENSATHIEN,RAPEEPONG SUPHANCHAIMAT,NOPPAKUN THAMMATACHAREE,WALAIPORN PATCHARANARUMOL

Increased access to equity capital helped these MFIs improve their capital adequacy, which, in turn, helped them leverage the domestic debt market. They also resorted to newer ways of raising capital through product structuring and introduction of innovative debt instruments. MFIs thus played a significant role in linking the processes of neo-liberal restructuring and financialisation with the daily lives of local communities.||TARA S NAIR

What the formation of the new media conglomerate (arguably one of the largest, if not the largest, in India) in the shake-out also signifies is growing concentration of ownership in an oligopolistic market that could lead to loss of media heterogeneity and plurality.||PARANJOY GUHA THAKURTA,SUBI CHATURVEDI

This has led to a lack of focus on the relational and political side of the problem of poverty, as well as on the lives of the poor. The domain of strategic decision-making of the poor has also not been adequately researched. This paper calls for further exploration of this domain by employing a combination of methods/techniques used in the field of social anthropology. Such depictions of the poor and of poverty would not only correct a bias in the orientation of studies on poverty, but would also serve a political end by possibly dislodging our complacent attitudes towards poverty and destitution.||MUKUL KUMAR
29/9/2012- ||special articles||41720191||Law and 'Live-in' Relationships in India||This paper focuses upon some of the legal moves which have brought adult heterosexual non-marital cohabitation patterns, popularly termed "live-in" relations, into public focus in India. These legal moves do not unambiguously signify legal sanction and recognition of new forms of non-marital heterosexual cohabitation patterns in India as some popular and judicial readings seem to suggest. Through a critical examination of some recommendations and aspects of the Malimath Committee and the debates ensuing from the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005, it is shown that the legal changes are primarily directed at taking cognisance of women's vulnerable position within conventional forms of non-marital relations. Contradictory interpretations and conflicting implications arise in the absence of such legal changes being explicitly cognisant of and responsive to diverse forms of live-in relations prevalent in contemporary society.||ANUJA AGRAWAL
