What is needed from progressives is a rigorous theory that must acknowledge what is present (class exploitation, imperialism, national and social oppression, profit-driven ecological destruction, gross commercialisation of all spheres of human life including culture and social relations) but also what is absent (collective democratic control over our lives, our planet, our bodies, our destiny, our culture). That should be the start of the process of bringing about fundamental changes in the status quo.||RAJU J DAS
29/12/2012- ||insight||41720548||AnRak Aluminium: Another Vedanta in the Making?||A bauxite/aluminium project very similar to the Vedanta project in Odisha is coming up in Visakhapatnam district of Andhra Pradesh. AnRak Aluminium, a company of the government of Ras al-Khaimah of the United Arab Emirates and Penna Cement of ap has secured approval for both an aluminium complex and the bauxite mines, but the final forest clearance for the mines is awaited. The AnRak project has replicated the Vedanta model of first building the refinery and then setting up the mine. The mine is to be operated by the state government to circumvent the ban on non-tribal landownership. In fact, the state government has disregarded the huge environmental and social impact and popular protests against mining bauxite in the Jerrela Hills, inhabited almost exclusively by adivasi tribes who will be displaced, to safeguard private gain.||PATRIK OSKARSSON

But the summit was not a failure that many have portrayed it to be. An analysis of the main outcomes. especially of the new "sustainable development goals", brings out the complex nature of the outcome and the challenges in the follow-up.||MARTIN KHOR

In the process he touched the lives of countless people who rated his friendship as a blessing. This is an account from one such admirer and friend.||NANDINI SUNDAR

In the end, the developing countries had some cause for satisfaction at the outcome of Rio+2o since some of their core concerns were included in the final document. However, the global South lacks as yet the knowledge capabilities required to counter the flood of Northern scholarship that is now directed towards establishing an architecture of global environmental governance that would preserve the current pattern of global economic dominance and significantly shift the burden of sustainability onto the developing world.||T JAYARAMAN

Just Bangladesh shares 54 rivers with India. Any unilateral action by India on any of its international rivers will degrade its relations with its neighbours while also adversely affecting its ecology, economy and society.||IMTIAZ AHMED

Delhi has been at the forefront of this shift and this has brought out conflicts over collection and disposal. This article argues that the informal sector should be meaningfully incorporated into an efficient and equitable waste management system that is also environmentally sustainable.||SETH SCHINDLER,FEDERICO DEMARIA,SHASHI B PANDIT

Yet governments of developing countries have not given adequate importance to the run-up to the conference. As has happened in the climate change negotiations, the outcome draft now under negotiation shows a concerted move to rewrite the terms of global environmental governance. There is an attempt to push through the decidedly narrow and environmentally defined "green economy" and there are moves to dilute the importance of development for poverty eradication. Backed by an arsenal of research on environmental economics, the North is out to set a policy agenda that the South is finding it difficult to catch up with.||T JAYARAMAN,DIVYA SINGH KOHLI,SHRUTI MITTAL

Despite their valuable contributions, CPRs are faced with decline in terms of both extent as well as contribution to the people, and therefore consequent neglect by the communities. This paper looks into the process of this negative change, and attributes the same to public policies, market forces and population growth (accentuating land hunger) along with the disintegration of traditional collective approaches of communities to maintain CPRs as community assets.||NARPAT S JODHA,NAVEEN P SINGH,CYNTHIA S BANTILAN

This will help devise better vocabularies and strategies for a livelihoods-based approach to ecological conservation as opposed to an accumulation-based one.||N PURENDRA PRASAD,VAMSI VAKULABHARANAM,K LAXMINARAYANA,SUDHEER KILARU

However, loopholes which allow producers to evade their responsibility and the informal sector to evade environmental and health controls need to be addressed. It is also important to create mass awareness and make it easier for the consumer to dispose e-waste. Policy should encourage cooperation rather than competition between those responsible for disposing e-waste.||RAVI AGARWAL
28/7/2012- ||perspectives||23251766||Theories of Oppression and Another Dialogue of Cultures||One of the first tasks of social knowledge in India today is to return agency to the communities at the receiving end of the system. We can do so only if we take seriously the various cultural modes of self-expression of these communities. Democracy can be a slow-moving, inept, obtuse tool in the case of small communities. But it still remains a powerful enabling device for those not pushed to the margin of desperation. Instead of shedding copious tears for the poverty and the exploitation of the dalits and adivasis, the time has come to celebrate their self-affirmation and the enormous diversity of cultural, ecological, artistic, technological and intellectual riches they, as communities, have nurtured over the millennia.||ASHIS NANDY

5/5/2012- ||commentary||23214827||The Emerging Environmental Burden from Pharmaceuticals||The enormity of pollution due to pharmaceuticals in India has caught the attention of researchers all over the world. This was due to the near extinction of vultures in the Indian subcontinent in the 1990s caused by diclofenac and a recent study in 2007 by Swedish scientists on pharmaceutical effluents in Patancheru in Hyderabad. The massive outsourcing of pharmaceutical production by the west has made third world nations like India a victim of unbridled opportunism. As the west wakes up to the environmental implications of "pharma pollution", Sweden's Medical Products Agency recommends a reduction in outsourcing and revisions in pharma manufacturing practices. Would these exhortations reduce pharmaceutical pollution in India or would they adversely impact India's advantages in the global drug market?||GEETHA MATHEW,M K UNNIKRISHNAN
9/6/2012- ||special articles||23214921||Dalits and Indian Environmental Politics||Indian environmental paradigms and politics, frequently conceptualised and expressed in terms of India's glorious past, often render questions of caste and dalits invisible. However, it needs to be recognised that caste is one of the central categories that frames environmental politics. Dalit thinkers, organisations and movements have had a wider perspective and critique of environmental articulations that require deeper investigation. On the one hand, we see a caste-blindness in current environmental politics. On the other, we see dalit views on Indian environmentalism, reflected in their works, words and movements in different parts of the country. This brings forth not only new dimensions on both environment and dalits, but also helps us in redefining certain key categories such as development, modernity, community, livelihood and social movements.||MUKUL SHARMA

It was fought against the exploitative design of ecosystem governance under the taungya method of artificial regeneration as invented by colonial foresters during the British rule. The movement is historic and mostly relevant in its radical gesture against ecological exploitation through inclusive technique of community involvement in the top-down management of forest resources.||SOURISH JHA

While the government investments continue to support chemical fertiliser-based farming models, this article explores the contradictions in soil health management policies and their impact on farming and food production. It argues that it is high time that the government chalks out a plan to move away from dependence on chemical fertilisers to ensure food security in the country and makes investments to support an holistic ecological fertilisation programme.||S R GOPIKRISHNA

Landscape urbanism has not contributed to social justice, political emancipation, or ecologically saner designs, as its proponents have argued. Instead, while small privately developed parks like the High Line have cornered most resources flowing to New York's parklands, far larger parks in poorer areas face a decline due to dwindling public investment.||LEON A MORENAS

Unless the state and its institutions recognise these interconnected linkages, the conflict will keep recurring, like it has for the past many decades.||ARUPJYOTI SAIKIA
