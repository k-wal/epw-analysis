It revolves around the story of V Venkataswamy, a cotton handloom weaver in Adilabad in Telangana. It is also based on a particular narrative about this individual and a photograph of an identity he projected of himself. The article pleads for an engagement with the ethics involved in technology change and the impact it is having on millions of people across the length and breadth of the country.||PANKAJ SEKHSARIA

It emphasises the complexity of issues and helps avoid the facile targeting of the poor as deficient citizens, whose latrine practices are viewed as a "primitive" source of social disorder and disease. Recognition that many factors are involved and interrelated might also serve as a warning against patchwork policies that disregard local context in their haste to proclaim another district an "open defecation free zone".||ASSA DORON,ROBIN JEFFREY

The ASI data suggests that over the past three decades Indian industry has spread to rural areas, creating more value and jobs than in industry located in urban areas. Industry is spending a smaller proportion of value added on interest payments than it did in the earlier decades. However, compared to the 1980s, the share of profit in gross value added has increased significantly, while factory-floor workers' emoluments as a share of total earnings have reduced.||SHRUTI J PANDEY,S L SHETTY

The potential shocks could cause short-term volatility, though the economy now seems better placed than a year ago to face the challenge. Yet, stabilisation does not ensure economic revival. Stepping up investment demand, without jeopardising the current account balance and increasing external debt would be the key to sustainable growth. As the private corporate sector is mired in debt, a pragmatic increase in public investment by revisiting fical rules is the only credible option. A complete pass-through of fuel prices to domestic consumers would encourage investment in the industrial and energy sectors, while an easy credit for agriculture and small-scale industry is likely to augment wage goods output to restrain the rise in consumer prices.||R NAGARAJ

These reactions have raised fundamental questions about the provision of elementary education as a public good and the role of the State in it. In this article an attempt is made to do a historical review of elementary education policies, placing them in the context of the constitutional objective of "equality of opportunity" and the fundamental right to education now guaranteed through the 86th amendment operationalised in the Act. The policies are reviewed with the lens of inclusion, as that has been, and continues to be, perhaps the most challenging issue in the education sector, even today. To what extent have the government's policies, and their modes of implementation, addressed the concerns and constraints faced by children from marginalised and excluded families in accessing their right to education as equal citizens? What are the implications for the future role of the State in the provision of basic education?||KIRAN BHATTY

The methodology is that of cross-section growth regressions, which seek to explain longer-run growth rates in terms of initial conditions of development. By identifying these connections, it seeks to illuminate the role of physical infrastructure, financial development, and human capital in influencing regional patterns of growth. In turn, this may have implications for government policies at the national and state levels.||NIRVIKAR SINGH,JAKE KENDALL,R K JAIN,JAI CHANDER
18/1/2014- ||special article||24478983||Reading the Tea Leaves on Financial Inclusion: The Case of Rural Labour Households||Understanding the extent of financial inclusion of rural labour households is important since in the intercensal period 2001-11, the proportion of agricultural labourers in the workforce increased by 3.5 percentage points. This paper examines progress in financial inclusion using information on indebtedness of rural labour households collected by the National Sample Survey Office as part of the surveys of employment and unemployment conducted in 2004-05 and 2009-10. It is estimated that 22.3 million out of the nearly 66 million rural labour households report being in debt in 2009-10. The share of formal institutions in the outstanding debt of rural labour households increased from 29% to 37% while the share of moneylenders decreased from 44% to 33% during this period. What is promising is that the reliance on institutional sources among rural labour households without cultivable land increased from 20.6% to 26%. The aggregate picture however masks large variations across the states and one does not observe any structural change in geographical distribution of flow of credit and share of outstanding advances to the landless.||S CHANDRASEKHAR

We find that distance from the central business district, proximity to the west coast, presence of slums, proportion of residential and commercial built-up areas, and proximity to the railway station have a significant impact on residential prices. Amenities and open spaces do not have any significant impact on prices. Further, we model the impact of the upcoming metro line on the residential prices. We find that the upcoming metro has no significant effect on prices. These findings have strong implications for policy decisions regarding introduction of land-based fiscal tools such as betterment levies for capturing land value appreciation that is expected to arise from new infrastructure.||SAHIL GANDHI,VAIDEHI TANDEL,ABHAY PETHE,VIDYADHAR PHATAK,SUSHRUT RISBUD

8/11/2014- ||special article||24481277||On Controlling Inflation||Under the theoretical hegemony of monetarism, and serving the interests of the capitalists, the government's anti-inflationary policy seeks to lower real wages and reduce employment to achieve its objective, this even as the level of aggregate demand falls short of the available supply. This paper suggests an alternative method of inflation control which uses transfer payments to the working population to bring down the rate of inflation by increasing aggregate output. Indeed, real wages and employment go up and post-tax profits do not suffer, even as the government balances its budget by taxing the capitalists to obtain the additional revenue to make the transfer payments. The method however requires capital controls to be in place.||PRABHAT PATNAIK

The perceived threat of globalisation and the failure of the state have led to ethnic mobilisation in the North East. This process of ethnification and the discourse of indigeneity have granted legitimacy to the inequalities that were very often embedded in traditional customs and practices. Witch-hunting practices of Assam force one to look more critically at some traditional practices that have been fostered by ethnification.||DEBARSHI PRASAD NATH

We argue that the BJP built this coalition, in addition to energising its traditional base of social conservatives, by mobilising voters who favour less state intervention in the economy. Narendra Modi's anointment as the BJP's prime ministerial candidate aided this strategy, as Modi is widely perceived to be a socially conservative, pro-market leader. The sclerotic performance of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government over the past few years compounded the BJP's own efforts. Though the BJP's support base remains Hindu, upper caste, and Hindi-speaking, these other two factors helped the BJP break the social and geographical barriers necessary to secure an outright Lok Sabha majority.||PRADEEP CHHIBBER,RAHUL VERMA

While the 71 seats won in UP significantly contributed to the BJP securing a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own, it is significant that the party made electoral gains across all castes and communities and across all regions in the state. This victory signalled a paradigm shift in voter behaviour, with a preference for good governance and development pushing out the identity politics of caste and community.||A K VERMA

This article examines whether mining in Goa meets Hartwick's rule, and finds that the state government captures only a small fraction of the value of the iron ore extracted from mines it has leased out. It also finds that most of the value of the iron ore is cornered by mining leaseholders, resulting in a significant redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich. It points to national and sub-national entities that follow Hartwick's rule, and says there are many best practices that can be easily adopted by India.||RAHUL BASU

We present evidence from new survey data collected in Bihar, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Many survey respondents' behaviour reveals a preference for open defecation: over 40% of households with a working latrine have at least one member who defecates in the open. Our data predict that if the government were to build a latrine for every rural household that lacks one, without changing sanitation preferences, most people in our sample in these states would nevertheless defecate in the open. Policymakers in India must lead a large-scale campaign to promote latrine use.||DIANE COFFEY,AASHISH GUPTA,PAYAL HATHI,NIDHI KHURANA,NIKHIL SRIVASTAV,SANGITA VYAS,DEAN SPEARS

The tendency of low-productivity states to catch up with high-productivity states is studied through the unconditional β-convergence approach, and the operation of Galton's fallacy through growth-terminal productivity-level regressions. The diminution of variance in productivity levels is tested using the σ-convergence approach and the robustness of the results is tested using alternative test statistics. The results reveal that states are converging in terms of land productivity, but not in terms of labour productivity.||S J BALAJI,SURESH PAL

Using National Sample Survey data it follows the change in the hierarchy of participation within a binary probit framework over the years. Since being eligible for higher education is found to be the key factor in participation, it also explores the role of supply-side constraints by controlling for the distance to a secondary school. Econometric estimations for rural and urban areas indicate a vast rural-urban divide in the role of socio-religious affiliations. Eligibility seems to be the key factor in participation, and a better understanding of the constraints on school education is critical if participation in higher education is to be increased.||RAKESH BASANT,GITANJALI SEN

These settlements are cases of denied urbanisation, where the territory takes an urban shape but infrastructure and services remain poor under rural local governments that lack resources. Some of these towns retain their census town status for decades, and basic services are neglected until they achieve urban status.

They have also failed to address the problem of lack of facilities for women and differently-abled people. With the Swacch Bharat Mission, the way forward must involve a careful rethinking of public toilet governance, including revision of planning norms, providing statutory backing to these norms, and creating effective regulatory institutions. This is essential to alleviate the intensifying everyday contestations between those who desire a "clean city" and those who are forced to defecate in the open.||INDIVAR JONNALAGADDA,SANDEEP TANNIRU

The poor management of such mines affects the local people who have been uprooted and their livelihoods destroyed. Their efforts to eke out a living by collecting coal from around these mines are termed "illegal mining" and leads to their victimisation.||PRAJNA PARAMITA MISHRA,SUJIT KUMAR MISHRA

Based on field research conducted in 2012 on all completed small hydropower projects in the state, it examines the implementation of Himachal Pradesh's small hydropower policy and highlights the local social and environmental impacts of small hydropower development. The vast majority of small hydropower projects have generated unmitigated negative effects; employment generation, while significant, is mostly temporary, and uncompensated deaths from construction-related accidents are especially worrying. Insights from this study provide the basis for proposing concrete steps that together could help small run-of-the-river hydropower projects realise their purported, but not realised, benefits.||J MARK BAKER

A 10-state survey in 2013 revealed that the pension scheme was running reasonably well. There is strong evidence to support the fact that the money is reaching the intended beneficiaries without any major leakages. The patterns of usage of the pension are indicative of its importance in the lives of the beneficiaries. An evaluation of the scheme also brings to the fore issues related to the diminutive amount, inefficient disbursal mechanism, cost of collection and the lack of a fixed pattern of payment.||SALONI CHOPRA,JESSICA PUDUSSERY

A key policy concern regarding subsidy reform is the adverse welfare effect on households, in particular lower-income households. This paper discusses the magnitude and evolution of the fiscal cost of fuel subsidies and the welfare implications of fuel subsidy reform for households. Fuel subsidies are found to be badly targeted, with the richest 10% of households receiving six times more in benefits than the poorest 10%. Reallocation of budgetary savings to better targeted social programmes could fully protect lower-income households from subsidy reform while still generating substantial net fiscal savings.||RAHUL ANAND,DAVID COADY,ADIL MOHOMMAD,VIMAL THAKOOR,JAMES P WALSH

This article explores three themes. First, it argues that these sections are themselves part of the government of free speech put in place so that "ordinary citizens" would not be hurt. Second, focusing on the writings of S N Balagangadhara, it explores how a narrative of Hindu hurt emerges. Third, it explores how Wendy Doniger's understanding of Hinduism is organised quite differently – around disciplinary history's concept of context. But contextualisation too, it suggests, is marked by a constitutive blindness to the thinking of religion as a pure gift.||AJAY SKARIA

The continuing hold of traditional religion and caste keeps the local-level communities well integrated. But this social cohesion, produced through the divinity of raja and the local devi/devatas, is also exclusionary in nature. However, there are also occasions when these traditional institutions are mobilised for "inclusion" of some kind. The local devi/devatas are sometimes used as channels by the local communities to articulate their opposition to "externally imposed" developmental projects.||ARVIND SEHGAL

This note argues that restricting the subsidy to an inferior good such as coarse grains alone may work better from both the fiscal and equity points of view. It recommends raising the entitlement for coarse grains to 7 kg a person per month, but keeping it unchanged for wheat and rice at 5 kg a person per month.||PARKASH CHANDER

However, as compared to additive measures, inequality indices give more consistent results, and hence can be used to examine the structure of markets in different industries. Nonetheless, since there are inconsistencies across different inequality indices, efforts should be made towards formulating a suitable criterion for selecting the most appropriate measure.||PULAK MISHRA,UJJWAL SINGH RAO

This article instead considers the sahibs in the provinces. When British India came to an end on 15 August 1947, it had 11 provinces under 13 governors (11 Britons, two Indians). These last governors of British India, located in a subjective space, found themselves straddling the dichotomy of the coloniser and the colonised. Based on the hitherto unused private papers and correspondences of Mountbatten and the governors, this article seeks to throw a different light on the engagements of the last days of the British in provincial India, where the rulers of the past (British governors) and rulers of the future (Indian ministers) jostled with each other.||RAKESH ANKIT

Health and disease are thought to be the products of the interaction among three key elements: the agent, the host, and the environment. This paper is an attempt to develop an approach that encompasses the concerns surrounding an understanding of disease ecology and a patient's behaviour during treatment. Using the example of tuberculosis patients put under DOTS, which disregards the patient's say in decision-making, it analyses the implications for the larger health issue using the political ecology approach.||BIKRAMADITYA KUMAR CHOUDHARY

But the path that leaders of the Palestinians have chosen, of violent resistance to the coloniser and occupier, has not yielded freedom from Israeli control. "Revolutionary" violence, first from Al Fatah and then Hamas, ultimately devolved into rent-seeking by a narrow Palestinian elite with a final settlement indefinitely deferred as per the design of a brutal, vicious and utterly immoral Israel. When faced with a test of violence it knows it cannot win, a people could simply choose not to play that particular game. If the Palestinians were to foreground non-violent political tactics, it will democratise the question of national strategy by showing everyday people that they too are soldiers of freedom. The Palestinian people now have to reclaim their half-state and refashion it into a real weapon of resistance.||

The UPA's political troubles arise not from policies that hurt growth but from an inability to tackle the consequences of accelerated economic growth – increased conflict over land, rent seeking and corruption in the booming infrastructure and natural resource sectors, inability of public education to keep up with increased demand and rising aspirations, and poor delivery of welfare schemes made possible by growing revenues.||MAITREESH GHATAK,PARIKSHIT GHOSH,ASHOK KOTWAL

In the process, questions about the emergence of alternative political formations have been pushed to the sidelines. This article argues that a development versus secular polarisation of national debates reflects a gross simplification of the politics of development in independent India. Through an examination of the historical antecedents of the contemporary dominance of the political right in Gujarat and by drawing on recent research, this article makes two interrelated arguments. First, it shows that the success of the right is inextricably linked to the botched-up development priorities of the past several decades. Second, it points to the inadequacy of the pro-poor policies and programmes promoted by the left-of-the-centre political coalitions.||PRAKASH KASHWAN

Evidence from a Major Indian Hospital||A central feature of many developing countries is the presence of significant gender differentials in health outcomes. Two potential factors that can account for this are that females access treatment later than males and that they receive differential care at the medical facility. This paper explores both of these in the context of eye care. The paper studies diagnostic and surgical outcomes of 60,000 patients who sought treatment over a three-month period in 2012 at the Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. The results show that at presentation, women have worse diagnoses than men for indicators of symptomatic illness. To resolve gender-based health inequalities in developing countries, we need to know where these inequalities lie. This paper finds them in access but not care. The findings suggest that women seek treatment later than men for symptomatic illness. That no such gender differential exists for asymptomatic diseases suggests that women do not necessarily go for regular preventive check-ups at a lower frequency than men. The paper finds no systematic evidence that women and men receive differential medical treatment.||RAJSHRI JAYARAMAN,DEBRAJ RAY,SHING-YI WANG

The Trade Facilitation Agreement (2013), agreed upon at the World Trade Organisation Bali Ministerial Meeting, promises to address at least a few of South Asia's trade facilitation concerns.||PRABIR DE

This cannot happen without forging a commonality among the oppressed which is at once non-patronising as well as self-critical.||AJAY GUDAVARTHY,NISSIM MANNATHUKKAREN

The location of the problem as one of deficient demand is untenable. The conception of financial literacy, as reflected in the Reserve Bank of India's Financial Literacy Guide, is packed with stereotypes of the poor as ignorant and in need of moral lessons on savings, consumption and credit. Financial literacy has to be positioned within a broader conceptual view of the financial system, so as to become a tool to raise critical consciousness and equip people to respond to the challenges posed by the financial sector. Further, financial literacy material must evolve from below, such that lives of the common people are organically a part of it. This paper also hints that the campaign mode for financial literacy might allow for greater public engagement and action. The effects of financial literacy, however, will not accrue if it is not accompanied by adequate outreach of banking services through credible public institutions.||SUKANYA BOSE,ARVIND SARDANA

It discusses the sociopolitical contexts in which multilingualism, language endangerment, and linguistic justice are constituted as subjects of political philosophy and looks into the postulated correlation of linguistic diversity with human development. No significant correlation of human development with language diversity is observed at the global level, but a fuzzy correlation is found in south Asia. Four normative statements are derived and negotiated with political philosophy to rationalise the discourse on language endangerment in south Asia. Based on this, the paper points out that development with diversity has to be the political philosophy of this region.||P SREEKUMAR

Further, the gap between running a dedicated, focused technological mission and improving the general level of manufacturing competence and quality is huge. isro was earlier closely involved in the development of dual-use technologies, that involvement continues though the organisation has tended to downplay its role in military applications as it seeks to obtain a larger share of the global civilian space market.||SHOBHIT MAHAJAN

Female self-fashioning in films has overwhelmingly centred around valorising a normative femininity, defined here as a femininity that privileges motherhood and the moral upbringing of the Malayalee nation through a moral submission to patriarchy. Agential roles for female protagonists are rare; the convention is to "punish" within the narrative female refusal of normative femininity. Three films, Trivandrum Lodge (2012), Gaddama (2011) and 22 Female Kottayam (2012), are read as challenging this edging out of the "woman question" through their naturalisation of female protagonists' habitation of spheres other than the private/domestic.

There has been much ado in sociology over the debate between hermeneutic and positivist approaches. Drawing insights from D P Mukerji, we see his intervention as an attempt to find a way out of this impasse through a distinct rendition of the Marxian dialectic, which is seen as open rather than closed. His rendition combines three principles: taking sides, dynamics of the objective human reality, and most truthful to the wholeness. This unique rendition, D P Mukerji argues, is apt for addressing the philosophical problem of sociology in the context of the specificity of Indian history.||ANJAN CHAKRABARTI,DEBARSHI TALUKDAR

It draws upon three months of research and visual documentation of AAP's party-building efforts in three of the 70 Delhi constituencies where it fielded candidates for its electoral debut in 2013.||SRIRUPA ROY

Once boundaries are operationalised on the basis of territorial belonging, politics revolves around who is from a particular place and who is not. This has created opportunities for accumulation for the indigenous people through rents. The state simultaneously installs and destabilises this politics of indigeneity. The paper shows how the state and capital are implicated in the structures of enfranchisement that have historically shaped the town.||MYTHRI PRASAD-ALEYAMMA

State Climate Change Planning in India||In 2009, the Government of India requested states to develop State Action Plans on Climate Change. Based on a detailed analysis of five state climate plans, this article finds that climate plans provide an important institutional platform to mainstream concerns of environmental sustainability into development planning but fail to update ideas of sustainability to include climate resilience. There are shortcomings in approach, process, formulation of outcomes, and implementation efforts. These shortcomings are united by a common thread – a tendency to prematurely view state climate plans as vehicles for generating implementable actions rather than an opportunity to redirect development towards climate resilience. However, if state plans are viewed as the beginning of a complex process of updating sustainable development planning rather than as an end in themselves, they provide a foundation upon which climate concerns can be more effectively mainstreamed in local development planning.||NAVROZ K DUBASH,ANU JOGESH

This article seeks to understand the phenomenon through a comparative analysis of the tertiary education sector in pre- and post-liberalisation Karnataka which turned into a site of patronage and social management.

This paper reviews the ecosystem services provided by casuarina in Australia and finds no mention that coastal protection has been the primay role of this species. The data from the "super cyclone" of October 1999 that devastated 12 districts of Odisha is compared with the storm protection afforded by other native species such as mangroves and mixed cashew nut forests found along the coast. It is seen that while native vegetation provided storm protection and saved human lives, casuarina did not have such an impact. The findings question the policy of planting casuarina as storm buffers in all cyclone-prone areas irrespective of the topography.||SAUDAMINI DAS,HARPINDER SANDHU

But the way this critical entitlement is being implemented leaves much to be desired. Apart from there being glaring gaps in the provisions of the Act, its implementation challenges have plagued the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the programme that is aimed at ushering in quality elementary education for all. The problems are many, and this paper observes that most of them can be connected to inadequate funds.

Often the debate is couched in terms of anti-trafficking lobbying/campaigns. The debate needs to be framed differently. Equating trafficking with sex work does a great disservice to both sex workers and to anti-trafficking campaigns, and only ends up infantilising women. The most powerful weapon to deny sex work the status of work is that of stigma. Stigmatising sex work has ensured keeping sex workers out of the legitimate political space and sections of the left and the women's movement seem to have acquiesced in that.||SUJATA GOTHOSKAR,APOORVA KAIWAR

These extend from the home to the public domain. Reserved and used almost exclusively by the male population, these are spaces where the power and legitimacy of masculinity are displayed and cemented and where men are at a distinct advantage in terms of deployment of power. Masculinisation of space means an access to and control over resources of various kinds – material, sociocultural, political and ideological. Signifying both the symbolic and the material dimension of male power, these spaces validate men's control at home, in the village, community, and wider society while asserting the caste and class hierarchies which are under attack in post-Independence India. Circulating ideals of gendered separateness, they make the presence of males and the absence of females seem "natural". This masculinisation of spaces goes totally unacknowledged and unchallenged even by those most affected. It has merited little comment, discussion or condemnation from any quarter.||PREM CHOWDHRY

Why was this claim not made when the Constitution was being framed? An exploration of the Constituent Assembly debates attempts to understand whether Christian castes were discussed and how fundamental religious liberties, which included crucial educational rights, were given importance over caste claims by the elite Christian representatives in the assembly. It draws a distinction between community rights and claims on the state. The implications of the cluster of rights known as "minority rights" are disentangled and the paper argues that the discriminatory clause in the Scheduled Castes Order of 1950 is part of the problem faced by dalit Christians. There is also a clash between the different kinds of entitlements at issue, which must be acknowledged to harmonise the justice of the state with fairness within the community.||ROWENA ROBINSON

By utilising qualitative research methods, this article shows how youth contest their marginalisation, for example, by equipping themselves with skills and competencies, or migrating. Despite their attempts, the educated lower-middle-class youth in Dehradun do not possess sufficient stocks of economic, cultural and social capital to consolidate their class position. These findings contribute to debates about the Indian middle classes, social reproduction and neo-liberal development.||ANDREW DEUCHAR
12/7/2014- ||commentary||24480296||Hardly the End of Dynastic Rule||Using data on the family background of members in the 2014, 2009 and 2004 Parliaments, this paper argues against the perception that dynastic rule in India is on the way out, thanks to the replacement of the Gandhis and the Congress Party by Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party, and with the rise of "young, aspirational voters". It points out that dynastic representation in the new Parliament is lower than in 2009, but nevertheless alive and well. Two persistent features of Indian democracy – the high returns associated with state office and the weak organisation of political parties – are catalysts to this trend, which even the BJP is not immune from.||KANCHAN CHANDRA

Moving from the domain of civil society into the realm of state politics, the leadership can change its goals and transformative priorities. This paper examines what happened to the farmers' movement (Shetkari Sanghatana) in Maharashtra between 1980 and 2014, especially after it decided to enter electoral politics and set up its own Swatantra Bharat Party. Probing its electoral performance, the paper tries to find out what happened to the mass movement, and explains why the farmers' movement that succeeded in mass mobilisation failed to convert mass support into electoral votes.||D N DHANAGARE

The present ethnocentric crisis in Assam is so volatile that most of the "tribes" have already rejected the proposal to become part of an "Assamese" identity. One finds that colonial ethnography and anthropological approaches in postcolonial Assam play a very crucial role in the present unresolved crisis.||MANASJYOTI BORDOLOI

This study on India shows that competitiveness is more likely to be achieved with the presence of foreign firms rather than by simple purchase of foreign technology. Absorptive capacity of firms and institutional factors (namely, competition in the industry) induce competitiveness among firms. It is seen that both the degree of competition and the absorptive capacity of firms have strong effects on indirect benefits from FDI in enhancing competitiveness.||SANGHITA MONDAL,MANOJ PANT

The primary reason for this is the state's inability to realise its own revenue potential – West Bengal's own tax revenue to state domestic product ratio is the lowest among all Indian states. The state also uses borrowings to finance its non-plan expenditure. The state government now wants the centre to restructure its debt and suspend its interest payments for three years. Analysing different scenarios, this paper evaluates whether such a relief package is necessary, or even the best way of avoiding a debt trap.||SOUMYA KANTI GHOSH,SUPARNA KARMAKAR,ARNAB NATH

The paper shows that at the all-India level, there has been an unambiguous fall in poverty during these years. This pattern is also observed in most (but not all) states. It also compares the rate of growth of per capita consumption expenditure of the bottom four deciles and that of the population as a whole. The scatter diagram of the rates of growth for these deciles and of average consumption shows an upward trend, providing some indication that the trickle-down hypothesis may have worked.||BHASKAR DUTTA,MANOJ PANDA

Gender discrimination, superimposed on caste and religious discrimination, accentuates the social exclusion of women belonging to certain castes and religions. We try to reveal how the incidence of the gender pay gap among different religious and social groups changed during the first decade of economic reforms. The presence of substantial wage differentials between men and women workers in the Indian labour market cannot be explained simply by the gender gap of human capital. Discrimination was more severe for women workers in the backward ethnic groups as compared to other women workers.||ANINDITA SENGUPTA,PANCHANAN DAS

This paper discusses in these terms the memory of two events that have shaped Italian national memory and identity: the Risorgimento (the war of national independence and unification) and the Resistance (the war of liberation from Fascism and Nazism). While both episodes are often celebrated in (literally) monumental terms, oral histories reveal hidden contradictions.||ALESSANDRO PORTELLI

These include: an alternative poverty line concept that is linked to the minimum "norms" for calorie intake enabling a reduction of the exclusion and inclusion errors, procurementjustforthe PDsand buffer stocks to be purchased at a farm price that is fully cost-based, fair price shops with fixed and adequate time of operations; "indent" of the demand, doorstep delivery, and so on.||BHUPAT M DESAI,ERROL D'SOUZA,N V NAMBOODIRI

In analysing two films by Vishal Bhardwaj and Dibakar Banerjee, the author argues that the incorporation of critical ideas on society and politics into the mainstream cinema reflects the diminishing potential of dissent in India, and is related to the rise of neo-liberalism and consumer culture. The present fascination with rural India and the subaltern figure in films means that the latter is being consumed as a product by the spectators of the films, as opposed to concern with social and political topics in politically committed cinema.||SARUNAS PAUNKSNIS

Indeed, many states have loosened and not tightened laws on gun control. In the meanwhile children have to go through "lockdown" drills in school to learn how to face possible violent events. Since the matter of gun rights is so related in the us to the concepts of individual liberty and the doctrine of self-sufficiency, it is time perhaps that the latter concepts themselves were re-examined.||ANU KUMAR

This framework, which explicitly includes environmental capital as a factor, enables the illustration of the entropy law being the driver of diminishing marginal returns and the limited ranges of substitutability between factors. Such revisions have profound implications for policy formulation. Stabilising environmental capital becomes an important instrument of policy at all levels.||DODO J THAMPAPILLAI

However, the pace of growth of this industry has shown a remarkable upswing only after 1991, and particularly after 2005. The introduction of pharmaceutical product patents brought new business opportunities. But the increase in competitive pressure has possibly induced the exit of small and inefficient firms and plants from the market. Against this backdrop, it is necessary to assess the performance of the pharmaceutical industry and find the factors responsible for the variation in industry efficiency and productivity. In this paper, stochastic frontier analysis has been used to estimate the efficiencies of plants using unit-level panel data (2000-05). An analysis of the forces of variation in the efficiencies and productivities of these industrial units has been conducted. Plants with low efficiencies have not survived – they have either merged with other plants or been compelled to discontinue their operations. Managerial skill and wage rates have had a significant positive effect on the performance of these plants. Some of the newly identified areas, with special facilities, are conducive to better performance.||CHIRANJIB NEOGI,ATSUKO KAMIIKE,TAKAHIRO SATO

Using Vector Auto Regression techniques on monthly data from April 1993 to March 2012, the paper also assesses the changing importance of various transmission channels of monetary policy in the pre-LAF and post-LAF periods. It is found that the bank lending channel remains an important means of transmission of monetary policy in India, but it has weakened in the post-LAF period. The interest rate and asset price channels have become stronger and the exchange rate channel, although weak, shows a mild improvement in the post-LAF period.||NANDINI SENGUPTA

This is shown by constructing and comparing a child under-nutrition index and child nutrition score, both of which use data from India's latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3). The CUI indicates that 16 of the 28 states have high or very high levels of child under-nutrition. The CNS indicates that 24 states have poor or very poor performance in delivering essential nutrition interventions for children. The strongest association between the CUI and the CNS is that states with higher CNS tend to have lower CUI.

It further illustrates core issues for participation and mobilisation, including the role of non-governmental organisations and community-based organisations.||VÉRONIQUE DUPONT,SUBHADRA BANDA,YASHAS VAIDYA,M M SHANKARE GOWDA

In order to problematise the biennale's ideology of cosmopolitanism, through which the organisers tried to surpass the existing institutions of art and democracy, this essay dwells upon the issues of spectatorship and the discursivity of art practices. It argues that there is a shift away from the principles of dissent and radical egalitarianism in the course of contemporary Indian art and that the biennale is an exemplary case of this turn.||SANDIP K LUIS

22/11/2014- ||commentary||24481021||Redefining Domestic Violence: Experiences of Dalit Women||Domestic violence against dalit women has not caught the attention of social science researchers. The National Family Health Survey 2006 showed that the prevalence of violence is much higher against women belonging to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes as compared to women outside these categories. This article is based on fieldwork done in parts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Among the causes for domestic violence against dalit women were male alcoholism, the man's suspicious nature, dowry demands, husband's extramarital relations and the complex social situations related to inter-caste marriages. Dalit and tribal women, thus, end up facing caste discrimination and harassment outside the home and domestic violence inside.||D SUJATHA

28/6/2014-5/7/2014||special article||24480533||Defining an Absence: Torture 'Debate' in India||This article focuses on the absence of a torture "debate" in India. The absence is striking when considered in relation to the National Human Rights Commission's statistics that there were 1,473 deaths in judicial custody and 124 in police custody in 2009-10. While the NHRC does not attribute all these deaths to custodial torture, there is a close link between the two as confirmed by many human rights groups. While this absence of a debate can be addressed at various levels, the paper articulates some of the theoretical framings that allow for a denial of torture to take place in India despite evidence of high levels of custodial deaths and torture. It suggests that the denial in multiple sites, most visible in the state discourses, contributes centrally to an absence of a public debate on torture in India.||JINEE LOKANEETA

This has led to a diversification of the modes of film-making in India, sometimes with very interesting results, and certainly, to significant technical and stylistic achievements. This article, which draws attention to the refashioning of the conventional cinema in the aftermath of the demise of the parallel-mainstream division in India, focuses on two questions. Does the idea of the "popular cinema" itself survive the end of the "great divide"? Can it really assimilate the political charge of the oppositional cinema?||MOINAK BISWAS

But the probable effects of this involvement have not been given adequate attention. Thus, there appears to be an easy parallel between the sanskritisation of modern Bangla and that of modern Hindi. This article is an attempt to explore the ways in which these apparently similar processes might also be dissimilar in significant respects. Further, it seeks to push certain hints that the two processes might also be interdependent. It argues, finally, that this similarity masks a complex and deeply consequential process of cultural "translation".||ALOK RAI

It has moved away from building state-led institutions to setting policy that pushed financial inclusion through non-state agencies as well. While identity, de-duplication, and authentication were issues that affected the pace of financial inclusion, they were not the most significant problems to be fixed. By allowing the Aadhaar project to set the discourse on financial inclusion, the State has moved away from the Reserve Bank of India's definition of comprehensive and meaningful financial inclusion towards a model that facilitates transactional aspects, with significant costs added at the intermediary levels.||M S SRIRAM

Using feminist work on the politics of waste, it argues that gendered precariousness is produced through human-as-waste conditions besides underscoring the importance of understanding it as a lived and felt process of precarity-in-the-making. This process not only shapes gendered experiences of precariousness wrought by environmental degradation but also informs sociopolitical struggles against precariousness and for social memory and belonging. It argues that these spaces of political struggle often also produce gendered contradictions and specific gendered divisions of labour within their political praxis.||PARVATHY BINOY

Insufficient attention has been paid to shifts in the enforcement of endogamy and the ways in which women's sexuality is controlled. These have varied not only by caste, but also over time and context. This paper argues that shifts in the assertion of endogamy vary according to a caste's consciousness and its aspirations at a particular historical moment. Further, in looking at varied responses to non-endogamous relationships and marriages, especially the tolerance to them in some instances, it explores the contingencies in the response. This shows that the idea of the "purity of the caste" masks forms of power often played out in the local – in the domestic, the village, or caste.||JANAKI ABRAHAM

That the socio-economic consequences of allowing present trends to continue will be serious is already manifest in widening disparities between castes and communities, classes, rural and urban areas, and individuals. Measures meant to counter this have not been pursued seriously and have had little effect on the ground reality of persistent inequality, slow growth, and an unacceptably high incidence of mass poverty and unemployment. This article calls for a radical retuning of policies aimed at achieving inclusive economic growth and a more egalitarian distribution of income.||A VAIDYANATHAN

As such, it discloses the findings of a resurvey assessing changes in cultivable landholdings spanning nearly 30 years. The debate over the relevance of persistence of the farmer within the backdrop of agrarian change is examined. The paper argues that the absence of a capitalist agrarian transition in Bangladesh is rooted in part in the absence of concentration in landholdings.||MAUSUMI MAHAPATRO,MAHBUB ULLAH

Eliminating existing forensic biases to rape and the neglect of healthcare needs of survivors, the model uses gender-sensitive protocol for medico-legal documentation of sexual violence, which focuses on informed consent, documentation of the nature of sexual violence, and collection of relevant forensic evidence. It uses standard treatment guidelines for the provision of treatment, and ensures psychosocial support to the survivor. The results indicate that a sensitive response by health professionals can play a crucial role in healing from sexual abuse.||SANGEETA REGE,PADMA BHATE-DEOSTHALI,JAGADEESH NARAYANA REDDY,SANA CONTRACTOR

In late movers such as Bihar and Jharkhand, improvement was evident between 2009-10 and 2011-12. The paper also estimates a seemingly unrelated regression model to quantify changes in the shares of consumption from the market, the PDS and home produce across states over the three rounds. The share of the PDS as a source of rice and wheat has increased over time, suggesting an improvement in its outreach.||ANDALEEB RAHMAN

However, there is always a tension between end-user connectivity providers and CAPs on the nuances of net neutrality, the principle that content consumed should be decided by the end-user without any distortion by the connectivity provider. While much attention has been paid to the technology dimensions of net neutrality, this paper addresses the economic dimensions, including access and termination pricing, the waterbed effect, and the two-sided nature of broadband markets. The paper also summarises regulatory views on net neutrality in the advanced countries such as the United States and the European Union and contrasts them with possibilities in emerging countries such as India.||ROHIT PRASAD,V SRIDHAR

It explores the exemptions from specific labour regulations accorded to particular activities and locates the anti-labour positions in the arbitration mechanisms under the state and judicial reinterpretations of existing laws. The popular discourse on labour regulation in India has been arguing in favour of labour market flexibility and doing away with restrictive labour legislation since it believes that labour laws hamper investment and growth of employment. This paper points to the increasing tendency of the Indian state to circumvent the gamut of existing labour laws, which in any case exist more on paper than in practice, by disengaging from the popular discourse on labour reforms and instead engaging in seemingly harmless norms of voluntary action and corporate social responsibility to facilitate accumulation.||ATUL SOOD,PAARITOSH NATH,SANGEETA GHOSH

Our empirical results show that voters do penalise candidates with criminal charges, but the magnitude of the penalty decreases if there are other candidates in the constituency with criminal charges. The vote shares are positively related to candidate wealth, with the marginal effect being higher for the candidates with criminal charges. Moreover, candidates with criminal charges also have greater wealth.||BHASKAR DUTTA,POONAM GUPTA

The Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana was rolled out in 2008 for households below the poverty line, enabling them to access health services in the public and private sectors.

27/9/2014- ||special article||24480742||Spatial Variation in the 'Muslim Vote' in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, 2014||In this paper, we propose to reconcile the controversial debate on Muslim "vote banks" in India by shifting the spatial focus from statewide assessments to the level of constituencies. With the example of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh in the 2014 general elections, and using an innovative booth-level ecological inference model, we show that Muslims might indeed vote en bloc for or against certain parties, but they tend to do so in a much more localised way than previously assumed. While public Muslim support for the Bharatiya Janata Party did not translate into electoral support in most places, there are important exceptions to this trend – and at least in the case of Uttar Pradesh, their support for competing parties followed a fairly complex spatial pattern. We further explore this spatial variation in Muslim vote pattern by looking at the moderating impact of minority concentration, violent communal history, and ethnic coordination and conclude with a call for more disaggregated research.||RAPHAEL SUSEWIND,RAHEEL DHATTIWALA

A federal country, with the fourth largest railway network and legacy of indigenised railway technology, India may make costly mistakes in pursuing HSR, an extremely expensive and complex technology, without enacting a national policy on HSR as a new mode of transport and adopting a policy for the acquisition of advanced rail technology with a strong focus on indigenisation and innovation.||ANJALI GOYAL

Looking at the 2012-13 escalation in the Cauvery river water dispute, this article examines how politics plays a part in shaping such disputes and sets limits on our responses to them through legal means. Considering the effects of politicisation, it argues that contrary to predictions of water wars, these politics may have a positive impact on accentuating interdependencies between states and deepening democratic spaces if they are supported by appropriate institutional responses.||SRINIVAS CHOKKAKULA

It does not find evidence of any significant role of changes in voter age distribution, media exposure, private benefits received from development and welfare programmes administered by local governments, or the vote-generating effectiveness of such programmes. A more important role was played by voter dissatisfaction with local leaders on corruption and lack of involvement in the provision of education services, and with non-local leaders on attitudes towards women, the poor, and local communities.||PRANAB BARDHAN,SANDIP MITRA,DILIP MOOKHERJEE,ANUSHA NATH

Energy as a resource and electricity as an amenity are no exceptions. In this context, this paper questions the relevance of promoting solar photovoltaic systems for lighting in rural areas. It asserts that the basic electricity needs of rural areas are no different from urban ones, and there is a willingness to pay for reliable supply of electricity. Studies show that solar PV's failure in villages is primarily due to glitches in maintenance, arising from lack of money, materials, and skilled humanpower. The answer would be to give these systems an urban focus, bringing in a more balanced use of solar energy for electrification.||HIPPU SALK KRISTLE NATHAN

The economic policies promoted by the central government between 1980 and 2004 – irrespective of the political party heading the Cabinet – mostly benefited the middle class and the corporate sector, while the poor and the rural world were clearly relegated to a secondary position in the governments' policy priorities. From this point of view the election of the United Progressive Alliance government in 2004 might constitute a more important break with the past.||DIEGO MAIORANO

But confused priorities and a lack of preparation and coordination ensured that this happened. The Indian Army plunged into rescue work, and did a creditworthy job, though it is debatable whether its efforts matched the high praise the media showered on it. It was the local people who helped themselves and their neighbours when outside assistance was slow in coming, and they were undoubtedly the heroes in this cataclysm, which was worsened by a history of neglect and an unresolved conflict.||GAUTAM NAVLAKHA

It looks into the possibility of a Lewsian transformation causing an increase in real rural wages, but the result of the analysis suggests that the rise in wages is because of an increase in bargaining power due to public works programmes, which employ unskilled rural workers. Food price inflation induces them to bargain for higher wages.||ATULAN GUHA,ASHUTOSH KR TRIPATHI

In light of rising social anxiety about poor, disenfranchised migrants in India, this article explores the political-economic conditions that give rise to their precarious employment, highlighting the prevalent practice of subcontracting and the associated lax regulation, which render workers vulnerable to exploitation. The research illustrates the power that the state wields, not only in regulation and law enforcement, but also as a principal employer.

New technologies are developed in the leading region but technological improvements in the lagging region are the result of learning from the leading region's technologies. The analysis sheds light on four salient questions. First, the paper determines the long-run growth rate of output per human capital unit in the leading region. Second, it defines a lagging to leading region technology ratio, study its stability properties, and then uses this ratio to ascertain the long-run growth rate of output per human capital unit in the lagging region. Third, for specific parameter values, it analyses the ratio of output per human capital unit in the lagging region to output per human capital unit in the leading region when both regions have converged to their balanced growth paths. Finally, the paper discusses the policy implications of our analysis and then offers suggestions for extending the research described here.||AMITRAJEET A BATABYAL,PETER NIJKAMP

The essence of conservation is traced through ecosophical meditations of Uexküll, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Deleuze and Guattari.

AP has transformed from an agriculture-based economy at the time of its formation to a service-sector based economy today. A political economy narrative of the process is described with focus on three important cleavages – class, caste and region. It is argued that there has been a crisis for both the idea and materiality of AP for a while that has now led to an imminent dissolution of the "united state". The development of a particular variety of capitalism in AP has happened through the successful wearing down of two major radical mobilisations (during the 1930s-50s and 1970s-90s) and through a counter-radical episode of primitive accumulation that began in the 1980s which continues till today.||VAMSI VAKULABHARANAM,SRIPAD MOTIRAM

Leadership, measured in terms of export shares, appears to have moved from the United States, United Kingdom and Germany to Ireland and then to India. India has been trying to maintain her leadership through improvements in technological capability and in the process has also become a base for multinationals to set up operations. These multinationals have been increasing their innovative activities in India as revealed through increased patenting, and domestic Indian enterprises have followed, although very slowly, in improving their technological capability. Two conclusions can be drawn. Leadership in CIS is basically a function of the availability of highly trained software engineers. But the sustainability of leadership depends on whether the industry is domestic or foreign owned.||SUNIL MANI

Theoretically, futures are expected to aid price discovery and risk mitigation. But empirical analysis shows that speculators drive the markets and, by virtue of their domination, abduct the price discovery process in certain commodities. The deceptive price discovery leads to suboptimal forecast of future prices. So futures markets fail to offer an effective hedge against price risk. In addition, the current public-private partnership regulation is a deterrent to the sustainable growth of futures markets.||K G SAHADEVAN

On the basis of an investigation begun by the United Progressive Alliance government, the National Democratic Alliance government has imposed an anti-dumping duty on purified terephthalic acid, an important input for production of many polyester products. The user companies argue that there is no evidence of dumping of imports and allege that the duty has been imposed to benefit domestic producers of PTA, of which there are only three and of whom the public sector producer has not complained of dumping.||PARANJOY GUHA THAKURTA

Numerous applications are filed every year in the Supreme Court and the high courts for appointment of arbitrators. This paper argues that (1) the judiciary has virtually created a monopoly by institutionalising appointment of retired judges as arbitrators; (2) courts have eliminated competition from other potentially capable professionals for appointment as arbitrators; and (3) there is lack of transparency in the process of appointment of arbitrators. Information to gauge the level of transparency in the appointment process has been obtained from 10 high courts and the Supreme Court through the Right to Information Act, 2005.||BADRINATH SRINIVASAN

During this two-year period, around 11 million jobs were created at an annual growth rate of around 1.1% per annum. Both rural and urban India witnessed a sharp decasualisation of employment, especially of females, and a significant improvement in the creation of regular wage employment as compared to previous rounds of the National Sample Survey. There was a faster decline in the share of workers in the farm sector during this period, while manufacturing and service sectors witnessed high growth rates in employment.||C RANGARAJAN,SEEMA,VIBEESH E M

The brunt of this is borne by workers and their families belonging to marginalised tribal communities. This gives space to organised crime to lure a large number of women and children to distant places on the pretext of providing them with jobs, which almost invariably leads to exploitation at a later stage. The findings of this study, done in 12 sick and closed tea gardens in Jalpaiguri district, demonstrate the close link between vulnerabilities, migration, and trafficking in children and women. It also suggests there have been changes in the nature of human trafficking in the country, calling for a new policy perspective on the issue.||BISWAJIT GHOSH

The truth, however, is quite different. This note attempts to revisit the "will" of the poet, arguing that his decision regarding the investment of the substantial sum reveals a complex story in which the need of the peasants of his zamindari and that of the community in Visva-Bharati were held in a delicate ethical balance.||SWATI GANGULY

This paper analyses the trends and turning points in irrigation development in the state, its shifts in cropping pattern, and trends in electricity consumption.

These investments have been triggered by market reform, investment subsidies, and better overall public service provision and governance. Almost all potato farmers, small and large, participate in cold storage and the availability of cold storages is associated with improved efficiency in value chains because of lower wastages even as a number of these cold storages have become involved in input, output, and especially credit markets. The increasing availability of modern cold storages has therefore led to important changes in potato value chains, with significant implications for smallholders.||BART MINTEN,THOMAS REARDON,K M SINGH,RAJIB SUTRADHAR

First, in the last two decades, Indian electorates have been more exposed to the media than ever before. Second, in the 2014 elections, electorates with higher media exposure were more likely to vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party. Third, voters with higher media exposure were more likely to vote for the BJP in previous Lok Sabha elections as well, and, in that sense, the 2014 elections were no different. Fourth, media exposure influenced the political preferences of people. It also finds that electorates with higher media exposure were more likely to support economic liberalisation, but that it made no difference on social conservatism.||RAHUL VERMA,SHREYAS SARDESAI

Almost 50% of BPL households were found to be non-poor and only 30% of them were aware about RSBY. More importantly, the effect of rsby on catastrophic health expenditure was not found to be statistically significant. Since commercial insurance companies and their third party administrators have limited interest in awareness generation and enrolment, their role may be reviewed and instead an independent public agency should be given responsibility for enrolment of unorganised sector workers. This would be a key step towards achieving universal population coverage. However, in the long run, the government should strengthen the resource-starved public health system.||SOUMITRA GHOSH

26/7/2014- ||special article||24479743||Should Real Wages of Workers Go Up in Indian Manufacturing?||This paper argues why it is important for real wages of workers in Indian manufacturing to go up. During 1998/99-2010/11, the growth in nominal wages appears to have been crowded out by a consistent increase in the consumer price index for industrial workers, rendering a scenario of temporally stagnant real wages in the manufacturing sector. There appears to be a discernible disparity between wage rates of directly employed and temporary workers. Moreover, trend growth rates of wages of supervisory and managerial staff, notwithstanding variation across industries, are significantly higher than that of workers, indicating that the stagnation of the real wage is presumably a stylised fact for workers but not for managerial and supervisory staff. The institution of minimum wage in India seems to be lackadaisical in enforcing a floor wage that compensates for a rise in prices, and providing a premium for the skill. The elasticity of real wages to average productivity of workers appears to be of a perceptibly lower magnitude.||T MURALIDHARAN,BINO PAUL G D,ASHUTOSH BISHNU MURTI

Aided by infighting in the Congress and the ineptness of the Indian National Lok Dal, the BJP's strategy was to sell the benefit of having the same party in power at the centre and in the state. Barring Jat-dominated west Haryana, the Narendra Modi factor and a social coalition of brahmins, other upper castes and dalits saw it win support in all regions, especially in urban constituencies and among educated and upper-class voters. Yet, it is still early days, and the Congress could prove worrisome if the BJP does not make good on its promises.||SANJAY KUMAR,PRANAV GUPTA,SHREYAS SARDESAI

The major findings are of a structural transformation with an absolute fall in agricultural employment and a rise in non-agricultural employment, increasing participation in education, decline in child labour, mechanisation of agriculture and rising living standards in rural areas due to a growth in real wages which led to a decline in workforce, most of which was of women leaving the workforce. A fall in demand for manufacturing exports and increasing capital intensity also resulted in a decline in manufacturing employment during 2004-05 – 2009-10. The paper estimates that approximately 17 million jobs per annum need to be created in non-agriculture during 2012-17. Based on these estimates, the paper makes policy suggestions to increase non-agricultural employment in India.||SANTOSH MEHROTRA,JAJATI PARIDA,SHARMISTHA SINHA,ANKITA GANDHI
9/8/2014- ||special article||24480792||The Colonial Origins of Indian Foreign Policymaking||This paper looks at three aspects of India's foreign policymaking. First, it argues that the institutional history of the foreign office in India is as old as the colonial project. Second, that the first world war was a major tipping point in Indian diplomatic history as the country gained a quasi-international status. While internationally it meant that India's status was closer to that of a dominion than a colony, domestically it catapulted more and more Indians into positions of influence in foreign policymaking. On major strategic issues Indian foreign policy was still conducted from the India Office in London. However, on a number of other important, even if normative, issues, Indians increasingly determined the agenda. Third, the paper discusses how in its post-Independence foreign policy India projected itself as a continuous international entity, rather than a new one, thus choosing to continue rather than close the colonial legacy of foreign policy.||VINEET THAKUR

It shows how the ideas and interests of different political groups have affected the institutional changes that have influenced fdi inflows. It also suggests that competition between provincial states has positively contributed to the growth of fdi inflows since the economic reforms of 1991.||SOJIN SHIN

The main focus of implementation in the past decade has been to persuade local governments to set up biodiversity management committees, which are to compile people's biodiversity registers. The success of state biodiversity boards is measured in terms of the number of committees set up. In addition, the prospect of financial gains is driving the law's implementation. The need for what a genuine dialogue on what a people-centred, biodiversity-sensitive, location-specific development model would look like has been lost sight of.||KANCHI KOHLI,SHALINI BHUTANI

However, they mostly compare Arthashastra with the works of Western scholars who are sympathetic to the notion of "realpolitik", thereby permanently locating Arthashastra within the confines of Political Realism. This article aims at situating Kautilya on a broader intellectual plane that moves beyond the realpolitik. In order to do so, the article maps the overlap between Arthashastra and a contemporary academic stream in IR — Social Constructivism. It concludes that "eclecticism" or the combination of ideas from a diverse range of sources is an innovative methodology to display the contemporary relevance of Arthashastra.||DEEPSHIKHA SHAHI

We need not fear that the Western Ghats will vanish if the expert panel recommendations are not accepted in toto: the forest area is still in safe hands, and the people's organisations (the village forest committees) are fully aware of the importance of conservation to their own survival and for serving global interests.

13/12/2014- ||special article||24481177||Boom and Bust? A Political Economy Reading of India's Growth Experience, 1993-2013||India's post-reform growth experience can be separated into three distinct growth episodes. The first growth episode was from 1993 to 2002 and was characterised by a set of predictable informal relationships ("ordered deals") between political and economic elites, which were relatively open as well. The second episode was from 2002 to 2010, and deals in this period became increasingly closed, leading to negative feedback effects along with structural retrogression of the economy. The third episode, beginning in 2011, was one of an incipient growth deceleration, and was characterised by increasingly disordered deals. This paper argues that this deceleration is the outcome of two separate phenomena: (1) increasing political delegitimation of the growth process that was seen as highly predatory and corruption-intensive; and (2) the pushback from accountability institutions in the post-2010 period. For growth to return, more than economic reforms or infrastructure spending, it is necessary for a realignment of the relationships between political and economic elites and between elites and non-elites such that there is a return to "open ordered deals".||KUNAL SEN,SABYASACHI KAR

An important departure in the Rangarajan method is to compute the poverty line commodity basket by combining items from two fractile groups to address the relatively higher expenses for some essential non-food items. This, while being statistically plausible, poses a behavioural dilemma, as there will be no fractile group that will satisfy both. As an alternative, we suggest dual poverty lines where the first is computed on the basis of average calorie, protein and fat requirements which are region- and state-specific and the second uses the combined median fractile group after adjusting the distribution with price differentials.||SRIJIT MISHRA

Our analysis identifies muted voices, generates recognition, and acknowledges ways of understanding and using the polyphony of difference. We argue that the value of reusing archived oral history data lies in the possibility for multiple interpretations of old and new data, and with this, new ways of hearing and listening to voices in interviews.||JOANNA BORNAT,PARVATI RAGHURAM,LEROI HENRY

Further, the rate of technical progress in an underdeveloped economy is not exogenous but varies directly with the share of domestic production geared towards exports (or the rate of growth of exports). Exports, through the demand generated by more discerning users/consumers in high-income economies, induce domestic producers into embodying new technologies in machines of a later vintage.||RAJIV JHA

Encouraged by increasing affordability of the technology and its promise to curb the demand for subsidised electricity, state governments in India are aggressively promoting solar irrigation pumps. Rajasthan became the pioneer by announcing a scheme in 2011 with 86% subsidy to horticulture farmers who used drip irrigation and farm ponds. Based on extensive fieldwork and survey in three districts of Rajasthan, this paper looks at the farmers' experiences, the design and implementation of the policy, and makes recommendations for a faster and more equitable diffusion of the technology, which could attack India's invidious nexus between energy and groundwater irrigation, and change it for the better.||AVINASH KISHORE,TUSHAAR SHAH,NIDHI PRABHA TEWARI

It observes that compared to what is reflected in the national rural drinking water programme database, the drinking water coverage status is poorer on the ground and scheme failures are more widespread. The case studies show that the causes of scheme failures have largely remained unchanged in spite of the changes in policy regimes. Poor capacity and expertise of state agencies are the main cause of poor outcomes and improving them will require infusion of new knowledge and practices. National policy can assist state agencies by creating avenues for educational and research institutions to work with the latter in various monitoring, evaluation, design and validation roles.||POOJA PRASAD,VISHAL MISHRA,MILIND SOHONI

This paper shows how Muslim women who have migrated to Jamia Nagar in Delhi are leading a more fulfilling life in their new locality, as is evident from the fact that they claim to have migrated for social security, well-being, better opportunities and higher education. Many of them are fleeing from small-town prejudices and overbearing families. However, it is also true that while Muslim women, belonging to different socio-economic backgrounds seek mobility, this is often achieved within the rubric of familial and community strategies of both migration and of living together as members of the same community in a territorial space marked out as their own. This has certain implications that both facilitate as well as impede their need for employment, safety and autonomy. Legal and policy frameworks must pay more attention to women migrants to create a gender sensitive migration policy.||MEENAKSHI THAPAN,ANSHU SINGH,NIDHITHA SREEKUMAR

New governance mechanisms inspired by neo-liberal thinking make claims about making cities function better, substantially improving basic infrastructure and public services, and increasing local democratic participation. But a study conducted in two non-metropolitan cities in Andhra Pradesh indicates that the state has promoted public-private partnerships, outsourcing and contracting out in a way that serves private interests rather than social interests. The disparities between poor residents and non-poor residents have increased and caste plays an increased role in decision-making bodies, though through a so-called inclusive participatory approach.||N PURENDRA PRASAD

Using techniques of substitution and false logic in their arguments, democratic language is appropriated by such institutions as a kind of co-option technique, high on rhetoric but perhaps leaving behind the very real issues that privatisation in general purports to overcome, and creating some new ones of their own. This, ironically, may also succeed in blurring the distinction between public and private institutions, and nullify the basis on which they have entered education.||DHANWANTI NAYAK

When faced with evidence of a poor conviction rate, instead of inquiring whether the prosecution was poorly conducted, the Court assumes that the "disgruntled wives" filed false cases. Ironically, while the courts convict husbands and their families in cases of dowry deaths, the woman's invocation of Section 498A when she fears for her life or demands her share of the matrimonial home, earns her the accusation of being a "disgruntled wife".||INDIRA JAISING

Gradually, the Gujarati elites began intervening to discipline and domesticate it for urban as well as non-urban audiences. post-Independence, experimental theatre groups too attempted this reconstitution through exoticisation and production of "difference" between the folk and the elite. This paper explores and interrogates the assumption that folk-theatre like the Bhavai can be disciplined and transposed unproblematically to urban and non-urban audiences. Bhavai as folk-theatre is located in a set of temporal and spatial prerequisites. Divested of these conditions Bhavai ceases to be what it is.||V SEBASTIAN

It offers an alternate mode of engagement with the perceived problem of the dependency of the "East" on "Western" epistemologies and theories. Allowing for power-laden relationships between places and peoples, it argues that attention should focus on the modes in which concepts are made to work and provide insight, rather than on their "purity" in relation to an ascribed point of origin. This is demonstrated through the three epistemes that have broadly characterised the "women's question" in a comparative frame - the colonial, the national and the post-national. Feminism in India is thus mobilised for generating conceptual frames that are good to think with, whether within the nation or beyond.||MARY E JOHN

A decline in public capital formation has also played a part in the slowdown. However, the contribution of the widening fiscal deficit is less clear-cut.

The government's argument is that the Rathvas cannot be adivasis if they are Hindus. What makes the move ominous is that the Chhota Udepur region inhabited by the Rathvas is mineral-rich and laws that protect adivasi rights come in the way of corporate exploitation of these resources. The order could also set a precedent to threaten adivasis elsewhere who protest against the loot of natural resources in their areas.||ARJUN RATHVA,DHANANJAY RAI,N RAJARAM

However, newer, equally stringent conditions are getting superimposed such as educational preferences and of living or working in the US. This paper shows how the educational and migratory aspirations of a young, mobile generation have given rise to newer behavioural patterns that pulsate in matrimonial alliances. By examining the profiles of Telugu brahmin brides and grooms, we explore the meanings of a new, coded vocabulary that has come into vogue to communicate partner preferences and the nuances therein.

In this strategy, the making of a communal consciousness requires a string of communal moments that produce and reproduce communal polarisation directly and indirectly. The Bharatiya Janata Party, backed by the cadres of the Sangh Parivar, holds an advantage in this communal game in Uttar Pradesh, while the other parties are forced to play it for fear of further losing their voter base. Post-election communal clashes in UP have occurred around constituencies going for assembly by-polls soon.

Looking back, it is obvious that the best policy would have been to introduce the inactivated poliovirus vaccine to prevent polio in every vaccinated child, and to use oral poliovirus vaccine by pulse campaigns to eliminate WPVs rapidly. This would have eliminated polio decades ago. Now that WPVs have been eliminated, IPV must be introduced as a prelude to withdrawing OPV. The road ahead is bumpy, but with the important lessons learnt so far, India can no longer pretend that it is too difficult to design a permanent public health infrastructure to control other communicable and non-communicable diseases.||T JACOB JOHN

Political interests and state power, especially state-sponsored advertising, were its main drivers. The low-key relationship between the media and business changed dramatically in the 1990s. Corporate and business interests now dominate Odisha's media, both through direct ownership and through advertisements. The mainstream media in the state primarily reflects the interests of certain sections of society, and a model of development that favours corporate dominance and accumulation through dispossession. An alternative media is gradually emerging in the vernacular and on the web, but they face significant challenges.||SUDHIR PATTNAIK

It puts the spotlight back on a class of small industrial towns, where the dirty work of production, particularly of recycling industrial cast-offs, assembling secondary products and catering to low-end domestic markets is not moved out of urban spaces. Instead it is kept hemmed into unplanned and unserviced town spaces, while large formal manufacturing firms colonise rural hinterlands. It also highlights how disconnects among sectors, space and place can keep a town at low levels of dynamism and social welfare.||KAREN COELHO,M VIJAYABASKAR

Tamil Nadu, which, unlike Kerala, did not have initial advantages over Gujarat, outperforms the latter on nearly every development indicator at the level of indicators as well as in the rate of change. This is despite Gujarat having a slightly higher economic growth rate. Tamil Nadu's relative success is the result of state intervention in providing essential public services. Further, the history of social mobilisation in the state has been crucial in ensuring the formulation and efficient execution of social welfare measures.||A KALAIYARASAN

After the Velvet Revolution, oral history became desirable for the purposes of democratisation, and also became necessary as there was a lack of "official" written documents. The current "boom" in oral history has had both negative and positive impacts: there exists a misuse of oral history for political purposes and the "hunt for sensation" on the one hand, and "giving voice" and democratisation of history on the other.||MIROSLAV VANěK

In this newly-founded economic discourse, education is seen as a vehicle for "human capital formation", a key both to avowed growth of aggregate economy and to upward economic mobility of individuals/households. An increasing dominance of this narrow neo-liberal view of education has undermined the long-standing hold of the pre-existing vision and liberal view of education wherein it is a means not only to material progress but also to higher level of civilisational ethos, enlightenment and democratic citizenship.||ARUP MAHARATNA

Presenting a state-level analysis of the association between state net domestic product per capita and three children's health indicators, this paper describes how these relationships differ in the last two rounds of the National Family Health Survey. It finds evidence that the cross-sectional relationships between aggregate wealth and children's health indicators are positive, yet the association was less steep in the mid-2000s than in the late 1990s. It also finds a negative relationship between growth in SNDP per capita and improvement in state-level children's health indicators. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the kinds of investments which improve health may lead to economic growth, rather than vice versa.||DIANE COFFEY,APARAJITA CHATTOPADHYAY,RAJAN GUPT

Urban growth boundaries the world over are typically known to drive land prices higher in the inner city area by artificially limiting the supply of land. Bengaluru has witnessed significant increases in land prices over the last decade. This paper examines whether the green belt in Bengaluru has had a significant effect on land prices through an analysis of price differentials inside and outside the growth boundaries. It also debates the relevance of a green belt as an urban containment tool in regimes characterised by ineffective provision of infrastructure and lax implementation of zoning regulations.||MADALASA VENKATARAMAN

There were gendered, community-based, official, unofficial, and popular ideas about children in the context of marriage and out of the competing official discourses on gender and modernity in Travancore, the one related to Christianity eventually became dominant. It presents the layers of discourses related to gender and child marriage: an official one in census reports, another in mid-level legal discussions, and a third more popular view. It discusses official presentations about gender relations as found in census reports in which concepts of modernity and civilisation are crucial and also an account of debates in the Travancore Legislative Council about child marriage in the 1930s. It also reviews a large number of cases involving dialogues between citizens and civil servants.||ANNA LINDBERG

To explain this variation, it makes a distinction between regionally-located parties and regionalist parties. While both are regional parties in the sense that they have territorially limited arenas of operation they are different in terms of their programme and agenda. In the 2014 elections, the regionally-located parties fared relatively poorly compared to regionalist parties. This paper argues that success and failure often depend on the efforts, strategies and tactics of competitors. It concludes that the strategy of the Bharatiya Janata Party was favourable to the electoral fortunes of regionalist parties and disadvantageous to the regionally-located parties.||K K KAILASH

With relatively tightly regulated financial markets, where concerns presently are more developmental than regulatory, the counterpart debate in emerging market economies centres on reconciling two widely held economic policy formulations, namely, the Mundell-Fleming "Impossible Trinity" and the "Taylor Rule". This article argues that EMEs can get around the trilemma by adopting a separate instrument as part of a consistent policy framework to target the external financial cycle. This would free up their interest rate policies to target the domestic business cycle, without the need to deviate from the Taylor Rule from time to time to target external financial stability.||ALOK SHEEL

This process has been accentuated by neo-liberal policies and their implementation through a massive deployment of security forces. The strategy of dominance and governance has done little to reduce regional disparity between the coastal districts and inland regions, and it has been legitimised through the electoral process, welfare support, and the media.||MANORANJAN MOHANTY

Though the total workforce has increased over time, the proportion engaged in agriculture has been falling and the number of marginal and small holdings has been declining. The farm surpluses of indebted farmers are very low, and 14% of marginal and 9% of small farmers are effectively bankrupt. Low profitability has prompted many small farmers to leave agriculture and 28% of them have entered the labour market. More pressingly, a significant number have preferred to take their own lives.||SUKHPAL SINGH,SHRUTI BHOGAL

Evidence from Longitudinal Research in Andhra Pradesh||Internationally, considerable research has been carried out on the subject of school choice or school vouchers. Recent evidence in other countries is mixed but increasingly pointing towards school choice not adding value in terms of curricular learning achievement. This paper presents findings from a large-scale five-year longitudinal research based on the randomised control trial methodology that was conducted in Andhra Pradesh. It finds that private schools add no value to children in terms of learning outcomes as compared to government schools. Children shifting to private schools under a scholarship programme perform no better than their government school counterparts even after five years of private schooling.||D D KAROPADY

It draws upon local histories of these two places which trace the intertwined histories of land, politics, domestic life, and work since the early-mid-20th century. The slum emerged as individuals from different communities and faiths collected there and set up homes and families but did not automatically generate social bonds that transcended individual interests. In sharp contrast, in the fishing hamlet, contrary to the widespread belief that collective empowerment of the poor, civil and political, requires a breaking down of caste-community identities, the resistance to exploitation and dispossession was and is rooted in invocations of the "community" even as several fisher castes organised around the worker identity.||J DEVIKA

The BJP's success was made possible, among other factors, due to its electoral strategy of reinventing social engineering in what may be termed as its second transformation. As a result, it secured significant support among the Other Backward Classes as well as scheduled caste and scheduled tribe voters to gain a winning edge. Besides this, its promise of development and the projection of Modi as a strong and decisive leader attracted support among the lower and middle classes. This will have far-reaching implications to the structure of party competition in the coming years and shape the post-Congress polity. However, enthusiastic over-readings of the mandate would pose a challenge to the BJP even as it searches for ways to entrench itself as a dominant national party in India.||SUHAS PALSHIKAR,K C SURI

This article argues towards a more contextualised, culturally-embedded understanding of Nagaland's electoral processes, which renders bare the incongruence between modern democracy and different traditional Naga polities, and bestows agency to them.

Far from being above and outside of politics as its exponents would have us believe, anti-corruption narratives are in fact inextricably mired in political struggle. Corruption's meanings and the uses to which they are put have changed with the liberalisation of the economy in India. This article traces the way in which India's increasingly assertive middle-classes have co-opted the anti-corruption discourse and used it as a tool to discredit their political opponents – the political class and the poor.||MATTHEW JENKINS

This paper examines how far the government has been successful in realising its objective of inclusive growth. As evidence of outcomes, it examines the National Sample Survey data on household consumption distribution in terms of relative distributional measures across social groups at different levels of regional aggregation by rural and urban sector. The estimates from four different NSS rounds for the agricultural years 1993-94, 2004-05, 2009-10 and 2011-12 throw up a profile of exclusion of the poor involving exclusionary growth of the better-off in the economy as a whole. At the national level, disparities across social groups have increased involving a widening of the average consumption shortfall of the scheduled tribes, a decline for the scheduled castes, marginal decline for the Other Backward Classes and an increase in the excess of average consumption of Other Social Groups with respect to the overall median. Similar analyses at the level of major states, by sector, corroborate in general the findings at the national level of an era of exclusionary growth confined to the better-off sections.||M H SURYANARAYANA,MOUSUMI DAS

It highlights the fact that resource abundance does not automatically translate into development; countries like Bangladesh suffer because of their local hegemonic rulers and global alliances which, in the name of development, extract disproportionate private profits from common property through the use of corrupt practices and skewed policies. The article also insists that natural energy resources should be considered common property, and in order to make development meaningful and sustainable should remain so. Planned development of the national capability is an essential precondition to maximise the potential use of natural resources. In the context of Bangladesh, a ban on exporting mineral resources and open-pit mining is also necessary to ensure energy security and sustainable development. It concludes that energy-sovereignty is the key to energy security, and therefore to sustainable development.||ANU MUHAMMAD

This note examines recent empirical evidence on the direction of causality for growth and inflation, and the short-run costs and long-run benefits of a deliberate policy of disinflation. There is no support for the first assertion because a regular trade-off does exist in India, imposing substantial short-run costs for deliberate disinflation. There is strong evidence for causality from growth to inflation, but the reverse cannot be ruled out. Under such conditions, the RBI should hold nominal growth of money supply and allow supply-side policies by the government to bring down inflation.||RAVINDRA H DHOLAKIA

Even though they did not, and could not have lived up to their promise of revolutionary change, these two movements have unsettled the status quo of the elites and have politicised new sections of the population. This in itself may well have opened up some spaces which were unavailable earlier.||KAMAL MUNIR,HUMEIRA IQTIDAR

The north-east states of the country and their people and cultures are very often not mentioned at all. However, the new NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) social science textbooks, besides being pedagogically superior, attempt to grapple with the real lives of people and sensitise and help children to critically engage with issues of diversity, inequality and discrimination.||DISHA NAWANI

This paper undertakes a systematic review of the evidence to consider how demand-side financing has been used and whether there has been any impact on maternal health service utilisation, maternal health, or other outcomes. The findings suggest that a relatively narrow focus on achieving targets has often overburdened health facilities, while inadequate referral systems and unethical practices present overwhelming barriers for women with obstetric complications. The limited evidence available also suggests that little has been done to challenge the low status of poor women at home and in the health system.||BENJAMIN M HUNTER,RAMILA BISHT,INDIRA CHAKRAVARTHI,SUSAN F MURRAY

Most of these measures are used for trend comparisons as they do not reflect actual levels of capacity utilisation. This paper proposes using the audited annual accounts of companies for an alternative method of estimating capacity utilisation for the manufacturing sector at the overall and industry levels. The proposed capacity utilisation index provides an annual estimate of the actual level of capacity utilisation, which captures the economic cycle well. It can be used for cross validation and benchmarking against other estimates of capacity utilisation. A time series of this measure of capacity utilisation will also be useful in macroeconomic analysis.||ANGSHUMAN HAIT,ROSHIN PAUL P

When communal animosity spreads across society, it corrodes the social conscience and (directly or subliminally) produces a genocidal consensus. In the aftermath of 1984 we also witnessed the decay of a reliable criminal justice system,the effects of which are still unfolding. It is time for us to see beyond parties, and pay attention to the functions of communal ideology. The reality today is that extremism is a mainstream phenomenon.||DILIP SIMEON

Although the relationship between economic restructuring and occupational/industrial diversities is fraught with ambiguities, it may generally be hypothesised that such enhanced openings would contribute towards the reduction in the often observed gendered segregation of labour in industries. Based on the unit level National Sample Survey Office data for various rounds, this study attempts to identify the industries in which women have stereotypically been bunched, and traces whether any changes have come about therein. The study also examines the role of education in diversification of industries in terms of men-women workforce composition. Even as the horizon of the labour market widens, it has not been able to provide women with expanded economic spaces.||TANUSREE PAUL,SARASWATI RAJU

Microfinance institutions have increasingly focused on financial performance and have neglected their declared social mission of poverty reduction and empowerment. Loan officers in the field are under enormous pressure to achieve individual financial targets and now routinely mistreat clients, especially poor women. The values of neo-liberal mainstream finance in the rich world have spread to microcredit in the villages of Bangladesh and India. This situation is hidden from western publics who are fed the lie of "the magic of microfinance" by their media, guided by the needs and interests of mainstream finance seeking to provide some "good news" about the financial sector as scandal after scandal unfold. Urgent action is needed, particularly from the leaders of the microfinance industry, to refocus their organisations and workforce on achieving both financial and social performance targets.||DAVID HULME,MATHILDE MAITROT

This paper presents findings from case studies of two transport infrastructure projects in Dehradun city to demonstrate that the reasons for the unexpected outcomes were of a more complex nature. Instead of local governments, all proposals were drawn up by consultants operating under unrealistic deadlines. Project proposals were prepared with an excessive focus on target expenditure and infrastructure creation.

Using the latest data sets – Census 2011 and the National Sample Survey housing condition round for 2008-09 – and the improved methodology used by the technical group on urban housing shortage, this paper re-estimates the rural shortage to be 62.01 million in 2012. Households living in temporary houses and in congested conditions were found to be mainly responsible for the rural housing shortage. The results suggest the need for holistically focusing on eradicating shelter deprivation in rural India and contributing to an enhancement of the quality of life of the people.||ARJUN KUMAR

Through a detailed analysis of the history of medical jurisprudence textbooks and their use in case law, this paper argues that these textbooks undermine legal reforms in India. It establishes that medical manuals promote the collection of prejudicial and legally irrelevant evidence and reinforce the notion that Indian women frequently bring false charges of rape. Courts regularly cite these textbooks as authority in rape cases, based on the perceived objectivity of medical science as a form of evidence. For legal reforms to be effective, this article argues that changes must be made to textbooks of medical jurisprudence, medical syllabi, and to protocols of medical examination and assessment of rape victims. Further, courts must be more critical in their use and acceptance of these medical manuals.||DURBA MITRA,MRINAL SATISH

He was an ardent advocate of masculinity and sports. This article discusses the influential contributions to theories of masculinity which provide a framework within which Vivekananda's physical activities and gendered notions can be situated. His belief that football is not insignificant reveals his concerns for the development of manliness among the so-called effeminate Bengalis. He himself practised a number of colonial sports and expressed profound interest in golf though these sports were not seen as a form of leisure. The lessons of physical culture not only strengthened his body but empowered his mind against inequality and perils. Vivekananda appeals to the Hindu sources for his construction of the body and mind of the spiritual aspirant as a site delimited and shielded.||AMITAVA CHATTERJEE,SOUVIK NAHA

26/4/2014- ||special article||24480125||The 'Employing Workers Index': A Critique and Review||This article reviews a prominent index in ongoing debates concerning labour regulations, the World Bank's Employing Workers Index. Drawing on research and studies on the EWI and its economic impact, it addresses three interrelated issues. First, the rationale behind labour regulations and labour standards and their evolution overtime. It argues that these regulations and standards are as relevant in today's world as they were in the past. Second, the paper reviews the methodological basis of the ewi and its scope in interpreting the economic impact of labour regulations. Third, it argues for moving beyond indicator-based rankings, to develop a better understanding of the complex interactions between different labour market institutions and the impediments to effective implementation of labour norms. In this context, the paper provides some insights into the limitations of the current labour regulatory framework in India in protecting workers' rights.||SUKTI DASGUPTA

30/8/2014- ||special article||24480497||Measuring Well-being and Accounting Prices of Environmental Resources||Along the non-optimal sustainable developmental paths of the economy, the choice between benefitbased or cost-based accounting prices for measuring wealth assumes importance from the point of empirical feasibility and tractability. In the context of depletion of environmental resource stocks in the development process, compensatory afforestation of one hectare of forestland or reduction of a tonne of particulate matter emission at margin could be regarded as marginal investment projects. The account price of the resource could be either the present value of costs or the present value of benefits of this marginal investment project. The presence of irreversibility in resource use could be a problem in using cost-based accounting prices. Therefore, an empirically feasible method of measuring wealth of a nation could be to use the cost-based accounting price in general and the benefit-based measure in the special cases where irreversibility is present.||M N MURTY

But not all wounds heal, some remain in a constant state of decay, degenerate, and ultimately risk turning into waste too. It is this possibility of waste that this article explores. The 1984 violence is one of those historical wounds that has neither faded from public memory nor fully healed. At the heart of this unhealing wound is the question of justice that has long been denied to the victims. The judicial affidavits prepared in early 1985 not only narrate the violence that unfolded systematically, but three decades later testify to the inability of the state apparatus to help heal its wounded citizens.||RAVINDER KAUR

While some of the controversies about the RTE Act were reported in the media and publicly discussed, this paper reports data from semi-structured interviews with key education officials and implementers, some of whom were responsible for drafting the Act, and traces successive iterations of draft bills. The paper exposes contestation, controversy and concessions that were made in policy backrooms throughout the processes framing the Act.||PRACHI SRIVASTAVA,CLAIRE NORONHA
20/9/2014- ||special article||24480707||Quotas under the Right to Education: Not Leading towards an Egalitarian Education System||Quotas for the weaker sections in private schools have been one of the most controversial provisions introduced by the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009. The quotas have imposed a debate on issues of social integration and equity in education that private actors had by and large escaped so far. However, the idea of an egalitarian education system with equality of opportunity as its primary goal appears to be outside the well-meaning space that private school principals inhabit. Therefore, the imposition of the quotas has led to resistance, sometimes justified. But the essential arguments against it are based on the logic of markets that the leadership in private schools has imbibed. This leads them to not only resist the idea of integration, but also devalue the enormous effort put in by children and parents from the weaker sections.||ANKUR SARIN,SWATI GUPTA

The analysis reveals that the categorisation of tariff lines under six different groups is the most crucial component governing tariff policy and the implementation period. India's negative balance of trade in rubber and rubber products with ASEAN and the high annual average growth rate of imports of finished rubber products underline the need for close monitoring of the trends in external trade with the trading bloc at the disaggregate level.||THARIAN GEORGE K,JOBY JOSEPH

Who among the contenders – the Nationalist Congress Party, the Shiv Sena, the BJP, and a Maratha elite now at a distance from both power and its community – will occupy the space vacated by the Congress? More than the defeat of the Congress and the NCP, what marks a new era for the politics of the state is the desertion of Maratha voters from the two Congress parties. In the present scenario, the BJP seems poised to pick its leaders in the state and build a social coalition that will stand by it for some time to come.||SUHAS PALSHIKAR

The real wage rate for farm as well as non-farm rural labour is moving upwards. This has serious implications for the farm sector. This study examines the trend and pattern of rural labour diversification and identifies the underlying factors for this change. The movement of workers outside the agriculture sector was found to be influenced by a complex set of factors such as the pattern of economic growth, inter-sectoral differences in the wage rate and worker productivity, government programmes, education, and sociocultural factors prevailing in rural India.||RAMESH CHAND,S K SRIVASTAVA

Previous research has shown that PDS rice consumption increased in Chhattisgarh following reforms by the Raman Singh government, which began in 2004. However, one-third of PDS rice consumption growth in Chhattisgarh took place before 2004. This finding suggests that the pre-2004 reforms to fair price shop ownership and state procurement by the Ajit Jogi government contributed to PDS consumption growth. Our findings suggest that sustained reforms, when coupled with political and social will, can improve PDS access, and that improvements may not be substantial or sustained in the absence of these factors.||PRASAD KRISHNAMURTHY,VIKRAM PATHANIA,SHARAD TANDON

The argument overlooks the deep hangover of a secular-leftist-political culture in Bengali society and therefore fails to understand the limited scope of caste politics in modern Bengal.||ARVIND KUMAR,AYAN GUHA

In the absence of such standards and the reluctance of health insurance companies to standardise either price or quality, healthcare services continue to be expensive and of doubtful quality. Developing standards of patient care by legislative mandate and a change in the attitude of health insurers can change the equation in favour of the patient who is now at the mercy of the hospital.||Meeta Rajivlochan

The northern Andaman Islands saw a lift of up to five feet while the Nicobars in the south subsided in places by nearly 15 feet. This resulted in much larger damage caused by the tsunami to life and property in the Nicobar Islands even though the area and population here is much less than that in the Andamans. Huge changes were also effected to the topography of the islands and the coastal and marine ecosystems. The subsequent years have seen increasing defence-related interest in the Nicobar groups and a number of projects have been commissioned, initiated or proposed. The hypothesis presented here is that there is a relationship between the damage and destruction caused, the notion of a wasted and washed-out land and seascape and the heightened defence presence and activity here.||Pankaj Sekhsaria
