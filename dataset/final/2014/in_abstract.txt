If it is indicative of a wider unfolding process related to climate change, it would suggest that a staggering number of species in India are moving home. This would adversely affect human habitat as well.||NAGRAJ ADVE

These have led to widespread grass-roots resistance. This paper takes a look at the major movements against dislocation and the state-corporate nexus that seeks to repress or counter them. It analyses who actually benefits from further depriving the poor, and the crony capitalism and capture of the state apparatus by the extractive sector. It also points out that an increasing convergence of the ecological and social justice trajectories is seen in the people's resistance movements.||KUNDAN KUMAR

First, India remains a constitutional democracy even when authoritarianism is embedded in the architecture of the state. The second paradox is that internationally India is a model for "democratic-development" even though the country has regressed into an abyss of poverty, dispossession, internal strife, ecological precariousness, rising fundamentalisms and militarism since Independence. The Ghadar centenary year is an opportune moment to reflect on the constitutive nature of the rebellion-repression-reform cycles that is formative of the Indian state and Constitution.||RADHA D'SOUZA

Based on field research conducted in 2012 on all completed small hydropower projects in the state, it examines the implementation of Himachal Pradesh's small hydropower policy and highlights the local social and environmental impacts of small hydropower development. The vast majority of small hydropower projects have generated unmitigated negative effects; employment generation, while significant, is mostly temporary, and uncompensated deaths from construction-related accidents are especially worrying. Insights from this study provide the basis for proposing concrete steps that together could help small run-of-the-river hydropower projects realise their purported, but not realised, benefits.||J MARK BAKER

Health and disease are thought to be the products of the interaction among three key elements: the agent, the host, and the environment. This paper is an attempt to develop an approach that encompasses the concerns surrounding an understanding of disease ecology and a patient's behaviour during treatment. Using the example of tuberculosis patients put under DOTS, which disregards the patient's say in decision-making, it analyses the implications for the larger health issue using the political ecology approach.||BIKRAMADITYA KUMAR CHOUDHARY

State Climate Change Planning in India||In 2009, the Government of India requested states to develop State Action Plans on Climate Change. Based on a detailed analysis of five state climate plans, this article finds that climate plans provide an important institutional platform to mainstream concerns of environmental sustainability into development planning but fail to update ideas of sustainability to include climate resilience. There are shortcomings in approach, process, formulation of outcomes, and implementation efforts. These shortcomings are united by a common thread – a tendency to prematurely view state climate plans as vehicles for generating implementable actions rather than an opportunity to redirect development towards climate resilience. However, if state plans are viewed as the beginning of a complex process of updating sustainable development planning rather than as an end in themselves, they provide a foundation upon which climate concerns can be more effectively mainstreamed in local development planning.||NAVROZ K DUBASH,ANU JOGESH

This paper reviews the ecosystem services provided by casuarina in Australia and finds no mention that coastal protection has been the primay role of this species. The data from the "super cyclone" of October 1999 that devastated 12 districts of Odisha is compared with the storm protection afforded by other native species such as mangroves and mixed cashew nut forests found along the coast. It is seen that while native vegetation provided storm protection and saved human lives, casuarina did not have such an impact. The findings question the policy of planting casuarina as storm buffers in all cyclone-prone areas irrespective of the topography.||SAUDAMINI DAS,HARPINDER SANDHU

The best way to meet this threat is by paying farmers to "grow" solar power as a remunerative cash crop. Doing so can reduce pressure on aquifers, cut the subsidy burden on electricity companies, reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture and improve farm incomes.

Using feminist work on the politics of waste, it argues that gendered precariousness is produced through human-as-waste conditions besides underscoring the importance of understanding it as a lived and felt process of precarity-in-the-making. This process not only shapes gendered experiences of precariousness wrought by environmental degradation but also informs sociopolitical struggles against precariousness and for social memory and belonging. It argues that these spaces of political struggle often also produce gendered contradictions and specific gendered divisions of labour within their political praxis.||PARVATHY BINOY

However, there is always a tension between end-user connectivity providers and CAPs on the nuances of net neutrality, the principle that content consumed should be decided by the end-user without any distortion by the connectivity provider. While much attention has been paid to the technology dimensions of net neutrality, this paper addresses the economic dimensions, including access and termination pricing, the waterbed effect, and the two-sided nature of broadband markets.

With the example of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh in the 2014 general elections, and using an innovative booth-level ecological inference model, we show that Muslims might indeed vote en bloc for or against certain parties, but they tend to do so in a much more localised way than previously assumed. While public Muslim support for the Bharatiya Janata Party did not translate into electoral support in most places, there are important exceptions to this trend – and at least in the case of Uttar Pradesh, their support for competing parties followed a fairly complex spatial pattern. We further explore this spatial variation in Muslim vote pattern by looking at the moderating impact of minority concentration, violent communal history, and ethnic coordination and conclude with a call for more disaggregated research.||RAPHAEL SUSEWIND,RAHEEL DHATTIWALA

It highlights the fact that resource abundance does not automatically translate into development; countries like Bangladesh suffer because of their local hegemonic rulers and global alliances which, in the name of development, extract disproportionate private profits from common property through the use of corrupt practices and skewed policies. The article also insists that natural energy resources should be considered common property, and in order to make development meaningful and sustainable should remain so. Planned development of the national capability is an essential precondition to maximise the potential use of natural resources. In the context of Bangladesh, a ban on exporting mineral resources and open-pit mining is also necessary to ensure energy security and sustainable development. It concludes that energy-sovereignty is the key to energy security, and therefore to sustainable development.||ANU MUHAMMAD

This article examines what this means for climate change mitigation in the forest context, and what it probably means to India, specifically.||P J DILIP KUMAR
30/8/2014- ||special article||24480497||Measuring Well-being and Accounting Prices of Environmental Resources||Along the non-optimal sustainable developmental paths of the economy, the choice between benefitbased or cost-based accounting prices for measuring wealth assumes importance from the point of empirical feasibility and tractability. In the context of depletion of environmental resource stocks in the development process, compensatory afforestation of one hectare of forestland or reduction of a tonne of particulate matter emission at margin could be regarded as marginal investment projects. The account price of the resource could be either the present value of costs or the present value of benefits of this marginal investment project. The presence of irreversibility in resource use could be a problem in using cost-based accounting prices. Therefore, an empirically feasible method of measuring wealth of a nation could be to use the cost-based accounting price in general and the benefit-based measure in the special cases where irreversibility is present.||M N MURTY
