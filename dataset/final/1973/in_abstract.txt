Today, the irrigation engineer looks at land as something either to water or to drain (but rarely both), the agricultural soil conservation engineer as something to terrace and bund, the forester as something to grow trees on, and the planner as something which can create largescale employment opportunities - whether for the skilled or the unskilled, whether for landless or the small farmer, whether in wet or dry conditions and whether on a crash or a continuing basis. We thus have a multiplicity of agencies each of which is necessarily interested only in implementing its own schemes without reference to the others and none of which can see the picture as a whole. This is a situation which can be corrected only by creating organisations that can take a synoptic and a sympathetic view of the needs of the land so that these may be catered to in a direct, deliberate and efficient manner. The management of land and soil resources is indissolubly linked with the management of water resources and cannot therefore be attempted without subjecting the latter to some discipline. It is because such discipline has been absent in the past that so little attention has been paid by our irrigation projects to the problems of sedimentation, water-logging and proper water utilisation. It will be necessary to ensure in the future that while on the one hand no new projects are taken up which do not give enough attention to these aspects, energetic steps are also taken on the other hand to remedy such deficiencies in the case of existing and on-going projects. Such a policy will not result in any shrinkage of employment opportunities for engineers, as feared by some, but rather in their expansion. A sound land policy will therefore automatically lead to a sound water policy which lays more emphasis on the development of ground water resources and insists on much more care with regard to surface water schemes. There is little doubt that such a policy will bring about a close working relationship at various levels between the proposed land authorities and the organisations which deal with the development of water resources, both ground and surface. In the fullness of time, the remorseless logic of circumstances will complete this process by demanding the creation of a Department of Land and Water in the Ministry of Agriculture at the Centre and of similar arrangements in the states. In due course, responsibility for various other neglected aspects of the ecological environment will also inevitably get drawn to such departments. Let us, however, take only one small step at a time.||B. B. Vohra

The heterogeneity of this group of DFCs and the diversity of their environmental and institutional characteristics makes generalisations about their performance very difficult. So also does the shifting posture of the World Bank, whose own basis of evaluation has changed. This paper makes the effort to reflect on so ne facts which seem unquestionable, and to make some generalisations from them.||William Diamond,Ravi Gulhati

Engineers must perceive the true nature of maintenance technology and whole-heartedly participate in it. Industrial management must recognise the true importance of the profession and create an environment that will attract talented engineers to it. Educational institutions must promote its development through the introduction of an integrated course of studies on Maintenance Engineering and also by encouraging the necessary research activity in the area. Even consulting engineers should find this a fertile field.||B. V. Chitnis
