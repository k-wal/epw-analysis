The need for a conference arises from the fact that the liner shipping market is characterised by an excess of tonnage. In such a situation unrestrained competition among shipping lines could lead to rate wars, to the detriment of the lines as well as shippers. This is the last of a series of three articles on the structure of the liner shipping freight market in India. It examines the conferences' methods of controlling competition. The subject is treated in two parts: the attempts made by conferences to protect their market from outside competition; and the efforts of individual lines in a conference to preserve or expand their shares of the conference trade.||Jeroo Kurus Coyaji

12/5/1973- ||special articles||4362630||Production Relations: Achilles' Heel of Indian Planning||Planning in India has been viewed mainly in terms of investment planning. This emphasis on investment planning can be traced to the influence of the long-period theories of development which entirely overlook the significance of much more essential factors than the level of investment. Increase in the supply of the means of production and savings is obviously an important factor in explaining the course of economic history through centuries, but its significance is completely overshadowed by the importance of changing production relations. It is the failure to assess the importance of the production relations aspect of economic dynamics that is, by and large, responsible for the Indian plans achieving so little. This article analyses this aspect of Indian economic development in the light of facts collected in three districts of Bihar. The analysis indicates that, unless the existing semi-feudal institutional set-up is replaced by a higher stage of production relations, any attempt at investment planning in areas and sectors where a semi-feudal institutional set-up exists-the agricultural sector, for instance-will be an exercise in futility. It is only when institutional changes have taken place that the decks will be cleared for investment planning.||Pradhan H. Prasad

This paper attempts a description of the organisational structure of the two central organisations of employers, viz, AIOE and EFI The description shows that both these apex employers' organisations are not organised in a way as to render service to their members in the field of industrial relations. They do not have well organised secretariats or specialists. They are organised in such a way as only to elicit response from members to various measures taken by the government in the field of industrial relations, and to participate as the representatives of Indian employers in the various industrial relations bodies functioning at the national and international levels.||K.

Apart from the fact that, for various types of properties, capital values are used to estimate the income accruing from their ownership, correct valuation of property prevents people from using property as a store of undeclared income. The government has recently taken appropriate legislative action to assume, as recommended by the Wanchoo Committee, powers to acquire properties undervalued at the time of sale. This paper raises the question whether the new legislation would effectively prevent undervaluation of property. Since examination of this question does not lead to a very reassuring conclusion, the authors go on to ask what other measure can be thought of to complement the new legislation. Two suggestions are examined in this context: one, that the government should assume not just the power but the obligation to acquire all undervalued property and, the other, that the government should extend the new right of pre-emption linked to understatement of property value under the new legislation to virtually everyone in the community.||I.

The intention is to bring out how the methodological problems become more acute with the present focus and orientation of the Fifth Plan Approach. There is brief discussion on the social discount rate, on the assumptions behind the NPV and the IRR method; on the two manuals - OECD and UNIDO - from practical angle on presentation of data in the detailed project reports; and on identification of common biases in the DPRs. A study of divergences in the benefits/costs from projects which are in the production stage against what was envisaged in the project reports, is recommended to help feedback from Appraisal Wing to Plan Formulation Wing.||J.

17/2/1973- ||special articles||4362334||Western Imperialism and India Today-II||This paper has attempted to investigate a few related aspects of the manifold economic ties between India and the Western powers. Much of the present structure of the relationships has been historically determined by nearly two centuries of British rule. Yet the attainment of political freedom by India and most other countries in the third world has bred the illusion that the latter group of countries ipso facto pursue their national interests in their dealings with their ex-masters. The present paper seriously questions this belief. In the first part which appeared in the Annual Number, February, the author attempted a summary appraisal of foreign aid programmes in general, especially of the US (questioning their true significance both in financial and real terms), the donors' motives for giving aid (a topic surprisingly overlooked by third world scholars), and the real or opportunistic costs to the donors. Sections II and III, in part one, continued the same line of argument to show the contrasts between the 'face' value and the 'real' value of foreign aid to India. Section IV questioned whether foreign aid was essential in any meaningful sense to India's economic development. It was argued that (1) the transfer of 'real' resources has been only a small fraction of the gross aid flows, and that (2) even if the extent of transfer was large it was by no means indispensable. Indeed, the easy availability of foreign aid postponed some vital structural changes which might have largely obviated the need for foreign aid. Sections V to VII were devoted to foreign private capital, and indicated the magnitude of foreign exchange drain due to the foreign sector, its domineering role in the organised private sector, and the new web of relationships it has woven with Indian capital. Towards the end of Section VII were examined the premises of a liberal 'open technology' policy. Sections VIII and IX appear here. Section VIII brings into focus the much wider implications of a choice of technology in the Indian context. An 'exports first' strategy, combined with a free inflow of the most advanced forms of Western technology, will, it is argued, warp the very foundation of the development process. The ninth and final section attempts a preliminary outline of an alternative policy in regard to technology.||N. K. Chandra

30/6/1973- ||special article||4362796||Indian Defence Expenditure in Global Perspective||There is a general trend in many parts of the world for defence outlay as a percentage of GNP to decline with the rapid growth of GNP and with the increasing spirit of detente that has developed in various traditional areas of tension. World military expenditure had been around 7 per cent of world GNP throughout the 1960s but fell to 6.3 per cent in 1970 and to about 6 per cent in 1971. This is still well above the Indian defence burden. In spite of this overall decline, in the areas immediately around India - such as Pakistan, Iran and China - there are no indications of a downward trend either in absolute terms or in terms of defence outlay as percentage of GNP. All these countries spend far above the world percentage. Even in regard to countries which are exhibiting a declining trend in their defence burdens, it is necessary to view the totality of their defence expend ture over the last two decades. A number of them have already developed certain levels of forces and presently do not find it expedient, in the light of the detente, to expand their forces or add to their military stockpiles. This appears to be the case in respect of countries like the United States, France, West Germany, Italy and Canada. The amount of defence outlay to be devoted to manage the security of a nation without unduly high expenditure is a matter of sophisticated political and economic judgment. But there is no study available in India estimating the cost to the economy of the postponed military/economic decisions due to the various uncertainties arising out of the national security Crisis of 1962, 1965 and 1971. A cost-benefit analysis of a slightly higher order of defence outlay, which might reduce the uncertainties in decision-making, would be very desirable.||K. Subrahmanyam

Definition of equivalence becomes more difficult, however, when the goods and services available and the household consumption patterns are quite different in the two regions. Determination of comparable groups, through an analysis of consumption at different income levels has been attempted before. Expenditure differentials between two regions have been derived through statistical analysis of Engel curves fitted to data on household expenditures on specific commodities and total outlay in the two regions. In this paper, is proposed a simple method of obtaining such expenditure differentials between two or more regions, especially when the joint distributions of the expenditures on specific items of consumption and total consumption expenditure in those regions are known.||N.

Because of lack of security and absence of sufficient incentives for and returns from investment, tenant farms are supposed to be run less efficiently than owner operated ones. The results of a systematic analysis of data taken from Farm Management sources, however, suggest that there are not very many marked differences in the input-output patterns of owner operated farms and tenant operated farms and that the latter are not run very differently from the former.||Aparajita Chakravarty,Ashok Rudra

If this temptation is to be curbed, it is necessary to amend the scheme in such a way that what the assessee may gain by way of reduction in income tax liability the loses by way of increased AHT liability.

In fact, the impact of the so-called 'green revolution' on the different strata of the rural population has been quite uneven. Because it was mainly those who cultivate large landholdings who have benefited most from the new developments and those who cultivate small holdings have benefited less, one consequence of the green revolution has been to widen disparities in income and wealth among the different strata of the rural population. It has also had the effect of widening the disparities among the regions. A further consequence of the green revolution, which follows from the secondary effects of changes in patterns of rural incomes and expenditures, is that in the case of those farmers whose physical farm output has not gone up, their real incomes have deteriorated absolutely, as result of the inflationary pressures and the greatly increased demand for manufactured consumer goods. If such complex secondary effects of the green revolution are taken into account, it is not so surprising that it was in 1968-the year in which the biggest harvests ever had been reaped - that the entire country and the countryside erupted with popular discontent on an unprecedented scale. It is only in the aftermath of that political upheaval, that the 'achievements' in the agricultural sector have begun to be reviewed afresh and some of its contradictions and paradoxes have been recognised.||Hamza Alavi

The first part of our estimate (1946-1958) covers 26 manufacturing industries and is based on the figures of the 'Census of Indian Manufactures'. The second part (1960-1965) covers 25 manufacturing industries and is based on the figures of the 'Annual Survey of Industries'. In our estimate we have accepted the most widely prevalent definition of productivity, namely, productivity of human labour, i e, "the ratio of output to the corresponding input of labour". We have, first, constructed the quantity index of output of each industry applying the 'Laspeyers' formula. Then, using the figures of 'man-hours worked', we have constructed the indices of productivity per man-hour. In our estimate, we have always taken into account the 'gross product' and not the 'net product'. The results of our estimate show that there has been a definite improvement in productivity in most of the manufacturing industries covered by our study, though no consistent or uniform pattern is noticed in the individual industries. There are also wide variations in the degree of improvement in productivity. Furthermore, there are wide and significant differences in productivity between various industries in absolute value terms.||Anil Kumar Chatterjee

06/10/1973- ||special articles||4363093||The North Eastern Council: Some Political Perspectives||On the face of it, it is difficult to see the rationale behind the formation of the North Eastern Council which came into existence on August 1, 1972 and was formally inaugurated by the Prime Minister on November 7, 1972. If, after the reorganisation of the North Eastern region, it was considered necessary to have a co-ordinating body for this region, a Zonal Council in terms of Articles 15-22 of the States Reorganisation Act of 1956 could have been formed. But, apparently, it was thought that this would not have met the 'special' requirements of the North Eastern region. Hence the North Eastern Council, was constituted under a separate Act of Parliament. The North Eastern Council seeks not merely to usurp the limited powers of the states, but to totally replace the authority of the states by the Centre, especially by the most active repressive organs of the Centre. What is sought to be achieved is not so much the whittling down of the powers of the states of the region but their reduction to a state of total impotence. Evidently it is not considered enough to secure even such total administrative control of the North Eastern region. The current efforts of the Congress party to spread its influence - through all available means - should be seen as an attempt to round off the process by acquiring total political control as well.||M.

This paper attempts to analyse these implications for the innorative chain. It also suggests certain changes, including in process strategies, for increasing the probability of the new goals being achieved.||R. S. Ganapathy

The first article (May 12) examined the scope of the Finance Commissions under the Constitution and brought out that the Constitution gives the Commissions the maximum freedom to operate in the areas under their purview. The second article (June 23) reviewed the approach of the Finance Commissions which have reported so far to the question of resources transfers between the Centre and the states. The third article (July 21) sought to offer some ideas about how the Sixth Finance Commission may make a departure from the gap-filling approach to Centre-state financial relations adopted by earlier Commissions. The present article poses three possible alternative approaches for the Sixth Finance Commission.||

22/12/1973- ||special articles||4363299||Vagaries of Soviet Wheat Production||It is a myth to hold that the recent wheat shortage is about to lead to the collapse of the Soviet agricultural system. The Soviet wheat problem is mainly due to wide fluctuations in annual production levels. These fluctuations are not caused by the climatic factor alone. Soviet wheat production is also affected by shortfalls in the supply of various agricultural inputs, by the prevailing cropping pattern and by low income returns from wheat cultivation. On the demand side, the Soviet Union has an unusually high per capita consumption of wheat and a large quantity of wheat is also used as animal feed. Wastage and export commitments further reduce domestic wheat availability. Despite these constraints, the Soviet Union is normally a net exporter of wheat.||R. G. Gidadhubli

This could be for a number of reasons, but in the sample dealt with here the hostility between the students and the policemen seems to be connected with the totally different social, economic and educational backgrounds of these two groups. It is not, therefore, very surprising that 78 per cent of the policemen questioned thought that students were basically a rowdy and unruly mob and only 21 per cent of the students had nothing negative to say about the police. However, large sections in both groups blamed meddlesome politicians or the university authorities for student-police clashes and were generally cynical about their social environment.||C. P.

This new version of one party dominance faces several strains and challenges arising mainly from failures in competitive mechanics, in economic performance and in party-building. Given these problems, and in view of the changed national context and goals, how long will this system remain functional for Indian politics?||Ram Joshi,Kirtidev Desai

As in the past, it will be impossible to reduce the disparity in the pattern of income distribution. In fact, the talk of such redistribution in the Approach document is intended to gloss over the Planning Commission's failure to face the tasks of production boldly. Evidently, the poor must remain poor - until they become public sector managers.||Phiroze B. Medhora

All human activities that are not directed at the fauna with hostile intent (like hunting) but which have a no less depletive potential (such as deprivation of habitat, overmuch disturbance by humanity, competition for fodder by domestic animals being permitted to graze in the preserve and the risk of such cattle conveying epidemic diseases to the wild herbivores) must be eliminated from a sanctuary area before the word 'protection' can have any value in actuality, and this cannot be achieved entirely by a comprehensive enactment adopted by all states, but also needs the co-operation of the people and the governments in other ways, even the reorientation of the attitude of most of our state governments towards their forests. For these reasons, we cannot expect the Wild Life (Protection) Act of 1972 to be fully comprehensive in its scope and application: it can, at best, prohibit direct aggression towards certain animals wherever found, provide punitive sanctions for breaches of such prohibitions, lay down that in preserves, in addition to the prohibition or direct aggression towards the animals, certain human activities should be barred, and provide for adequately diminishing, or extinguishing altogether, existing human rights in the area. An act can also prescribe or specify the administrative set-up necessary for the fulfilment of its objectives and provide for contingencies and specify exceptions. The Wild Life (Protection) Act does all this, but not always with that informed awareness of our wildlife crisis that one might reasonably expect of it, and not without the weakness of an avoidable provision for compromise. Nor is it wholly free from formal deficiencies.||M. Krishnan

Underemployment in this context is defined simply as the difference between the availability and requirement of labour, estimated by statistical procedures which are outlined in Section I where the methodology is discussed. Section II gives the results of the exercise, and the estimates of underemployment are broken down regionally according to districts as well as seasonally for the kharif and rabi seasons, respectively. Section III examines the results in the context of the observed seasonal variations in wage rates in the different districts of Rajasthan. The results of a regression exercise, to determine the explanatory role of individual factors in determining the employment pattern, are also presented in this Section. Section IV discusses some of the policy implications emerging from the study.||Kanta Ahuja

In India itself there has been much controversy over the real benefit to this country of its trade with the Soviet Union. This article compares the unit values for our major imports from and exports to the Soviet Union with the unit values for the same commodities imported from or exported to other countries. The study clearly establishes that in its trade with the Soviet Union India has not been the loser. There are some cases in which India obtained lower unit values for its exports to the Soviet Union. But these constitute a small percentage of India's total exports to the Soviet Union. Similarly, in the case of imports, the general trend has been that the unit values of India's imports from the Soviet Union have been lower than those of imports from other countries. There are a few exceptions to this, but, once again, these constitute a small percentage of our total imports from the Soviet Union.||M. Sebastian

09/6/1973- ||special articles||4362720||The Telengana Peasant Armed Struggle, 1946-51||Over 20 years ago, Acharya Vinoba Bhave launched his bhoodan movement at Pochampalli, a village in Telengana where communists had carried on an armed struggle for five years around an agrarian programme. Bhoodan was to be the sarvodaya answer to the communist challenge on the land problem and was meant to achieve what legislative action was not expected to do. The minuscular peasant revolt in Naxalbari (1967) was a reminder that neither the sarvodaya approach nor the legislative process (in which communists had begun participating after abandoning the tactic of armed struggle) had solved the agrarian problem in India. There have been many Naxalbaris since. The Maoist perspective in the Indian communist movement, which began with the Telengana struggle, has resulted in an extra-spectrum trend which rejects the parliamentary system and seeks to achieve the people's democratic revolution through people's war linked to an agrarian programme. The re-emergence of the Macist trend in the Indian communist movement marks the return of the "Telengana line". The 25th anniversary of the Telengana armed struggle last year found the Indian communist movement indulging in polemics on the nature and significance of the struggle. The main controversy was over the circumstances attending the withdrawal of the struggle in 1951. This article seeks to place the 'Telengana line' in perspective with particular reference to its relevance to the split in the Indian communist movement in 1964 and again in 1968.||Mohan Ram

Perhaps no method of project evaluation can do so in a mixed, and partially controlled, economy. Unless a number of prior assumptions can be made about questions such as the degree of "openness", the development objectives of the country, and the planning approach and apparatus (or, rather, the lack of it), it cannot be taken as proven that the development function can best be delegated to project evaluators. In developing economies the role of the Little-Mirrlees method is likely to be very much more restricted than what its authors envision. Given the existence of a long-term plan and the broad sectoral allocation of investment, the method can be used to make some micro-level decisions-but no more.||Bimal Jalan

The warped pattern of economic growth during the colonial period and following it, ensured that a three-tier society was created and maintained in Uganda-with Europeans at the top, Asians in the middle and Africans generally at the bottom. This becomes clear on looking at the income statistics and other data on the relative standards of living of the three races. In this colonial situation, the Asians of Uganda were the victims of a hierarchical economic and social web rather than its creators.||R. R. Ramchandani

First, instead of a negative policy of restraint, it has to be a positive instrument for growth. Second, to the extent it has to be a policy of restraint, the axe will have to fall mainly on non-work incomes rather than on wages and salaries. Third, in regard to work incomes, its main task would be the rationalisation of relative wages and salaries. Fourth, given the nature of the economy and the complex tasks of an incomes policy, the machinery for its implementation will have to be not merely more comprehensive but will also have to be backed by the force of law. Finally, an incomes policy would thus be an instrument of planning of incomes of the various groups in society in keeping with the country's economic and social goals.||T. S. Papola

This results in increase in the average productivity of labour, but at a very low rate-at a much lower rate than the rate of decrease of labour input per acre. If this increase in labour productivity gets more than counterbalanced by the increase in labour input per acre that goes with it, the net result would be diminishing yield per acre-as has allegedly been observed to hold quite generally. This paper seeks to show that the marginalist model which has been used to explain this phenomenon in terms of the composition of labour consisting of family labour and hired labour does not seem to work.||Ashok Rudra,Bela Bandopadhyaya

In the tactic of individual annihilation they thought they had found an alternative to mass organisation and mass ideological propaganda. Initially, the annihilation policy was a success. As soon as two or three landlords were killed, the others ran away to the safety of the towns or became ardent supporters of the Naxalites overnight. These killings created a power vacuum in the villages and the Naxalites stepped in to fill the void. The Naxalites described these areas as "liberated" because they could move around freely within their boundaries. But soon the number of murders of class enemies became the criterion by which the Naxalites began judging the revolutionary tempo of a locality. Whenever an annihilation took place in a new area, the event was equated with the spread of revolution to that area. The guerillas did not take the masses into confidence in the "liberated" areas. The assassinations were done by a handful of activists, the criminal elements in the villages were drawn towards the movement and the economic demands of the villagers were ignored. All these factors alienated the Naxalites further from the masses. The Naxalites also underestimated 'white terror' and over-estimated their own strength They had very few firearms, and utterly inadequate supply of ammunition, almost no training in guerilla warfare and ideology and, worst of all, the people were not on their side in their conflict with the police. The police force met with feeble resistance when it entered these "liberated" areas and was brutal in its suppression of the movement.||Biplab Dasgupta

By taking this long sweep of years, it hopes to shed some light on the direction of structural change that occurred in India's 22 major industries during 1948-68. Also, the division of these industries into the traditional and the relatively newer engineering and chemical groups would enable us to examine the role played by firms under managing agencies in the context of economic growth.||Arabinda Ghosh

The two bodies organised pressure groups rather than service bodies. Their main purpose is to defend the interests of employers in various tripartite and bipartite committees in which they are represented as well as to take up issues directly with the government. The examination of a few specific cases attempted by the author shows that even when they do not fully succeed in thwarting the enactment of measures which are against the interests of the employers, these bodies succeed at least in delaying government action.||K.

It is estimated that poor countries contribute, via trade, 15 to 10 per cent, respectively, of the annual increases in employment and productivity in the rich countries. It seems that poor countries transfer at the rate of 48 per cent of the increase in the productivity of their exports, to the rich countries. Such trade involves elements of exploitation; defined as one way transfer of productivity.||Romesh K. Diwan

In such a situation unrestrained competition among shipping lines could lead to rate wars, to the detriment of the lines as well as shippers. This is the second of a series of three articles on the structure of the liner shipping freight market in India. It examines the conferences' machinery for fixing freight rates, the principles which determine the rates and the major factors which influence them. The rates on selected commodities, important in India's foreign trade, are also analysed.||Jeroo Kurus Coyaji

07/7/1973- ||special articles||4362822||The Politics and Economics of "Intermediate Regimes"||Michal Kalecki used the term "intermediate regimes" to describe governments in which the lower-middle-class and the rich peasantry could be identified as performing the role of the ruling class. Kalecki recognised that such governments would have to enter into some arrangements with the native upper-middle-class; that such arrangements might range from "far-reaching nationalisation (usually with compensation) to a mere limitation of the scope of private investment coupled with attempts, as a rule rather ineffective, to adjust its structure to the general goals of development"; and that "the choice of the particular variant of dealing with big business is determined not so much by the ideology of the ruling class, as by the strength of the former". Further, it was his view that the way in which land reform is carried out would limit the potentialities of increasing agricultural output, as small farms would be unable to expand their production under the prevailing agrarian relations. Nor did he expect farm labourers, workers in small factories, or the unemployed and the casually unemployed to benefit perceptibly from the growth process under these conditions. Nevertheless, and this is what is most significant, he thought the system could be politically viable. Kalecki's analysis of intermediate regimes deserves closer examination. Fro not only do the social classes (or strata) which stand between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie form the bulk of the population in most of the underdeveloped countries (as in Marx's own time) but new forms of political and economic organisation, various technological advances, and the emerging international political alignments themselves offer a wider range of options to these countries than were available until the middle of the present century. Whether state capitalism can provide a viable economic basis for regimes dominated by one or more of these classes, what characteristics and tendencies it is likely to develop within this kind of political framework, and how much a system could evolve over a period of time in these countries are therefore questions of considerable importance today. Their relevance to India needs hardly to be mentioned.||K. N. Raj

1/8/1973- ||fifth plan model||4362924||The Fifth Five-Year Plan Model: A Comment||This paper attempts an analysis of some of the assumptions and results underlying the basic formulations of the Fifth Plan. Attention has been focused on two aspects of the Plan, viz, the implications of redistribution of consumption and of import substitution. The analysis of the Fifth Plan model, as set out in the Planning Commission's "Technical Note on the Approach to the Fifth Plan", brings out the lack of any obvious relation between 'redistribution' and 'self-reliance'. It shows that import-saving is achieved in the preferred variant only by altering a priori the import co-efficients. The calculations made in this paper indicate that 56 per cent of the reduction in imports, as a result of import substitution, is brought about by reducing the import proportions for investment requirements. Since sectoral investments are exogenously specified, and the import proportions of sectoral investments are similarly altered, the claim made in the Approach paper that redistribution of consumption also leads to a decline in import requirements is puzzling. The Technical Note fails to explain the casual relationship between the two.||T. N. Krishnan

So studies of fertility are enhanced, for purposes of science and policy alike, when they include consideration of social and cultural forces. A good many people in India practised fertility control long before they had knowledge of modern contraceptive techniques. They did so for traditional social reasons and by methods traditional in the culture. These means and motivations are still current and, if properly understood, could be more effectively utilised in family planning efforts than they have been.||David G. Mandelbaum

28/7/1973- ||special articles||4362898||International Monetary Crises and the Indian Rupee||India is affected by the current international monetary disturbances, particularly because of their unsettling effects on its exports and imports and because of its increased burden of servicing and repayment obligations in strong currencies such as the yen or the D-mark. However, developing countries like India are not in a position to significantly influence the course of events in the international monetary scene - except perhaps by a joint stand. In the circumstances, they have no other immediate option but to adjust their exchange rate policies and programmes to the emerging exchange market situation with a view to minimising the adverse effects of the monetary upheavals on their own trade and payment positions. Exchange rates and exchange controls are not policies per se but just tools to be used effectively to serve the best interests of the country. It is naive to take exchange rates as sacrosanct. Devaluation has acquired an emotive connotation in India, so that unless we begin to look at the issues involved with an open mind, we will deny ourselves the advantages arising from the use of one of the most important tools for managing our balance of payments. How has the Indian rupee fared during the recent monetary upheavals; is the current rupee exchange rate realistic; what impact do the current rates have on India's balance of payments; what considerations are relevant for evolving a realistic rupee exchange rate policy. These are some of the issues discussed in the following sections.||S. K. Verghese

It is, nevertheless, at the micro-level that the success or failure of the policy will be determined. Questions of labour supply, of project organisation, of absolute income levels, and of nutrition cannot be effectively analysed without household and village level studies which explore the interactions of these factors with the supply of public works employment. This article presents some results from one such study. The author wishes to emphasise that a single study in one area is insufficient for generalisation. Questions are opened here rather than closed, and a series of micro-studies would be required before general implications for policy could be accurately derived. Still, important variables and potential constraints can be identified, and their importance under alternative circumstances may be considered.||G. B. Rodgers

10/3/1973- ||special articles||4362405||Economics of Television for India||Considerable public interest has been evoked on the question of developing a nation-wide educational TV system in India. Both Indian and foreign scholars have made major studies on this question. These painstaking studies, spearheaded by space scientists and electronic engineers, have undoubtedly contributed to improved knowledge, especially pertaining to the satellite technology as applied to the particular circumstances prevailing in India. Government of India has already entered into a formal agreement with the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to have a pilot satellite TV experiment in India in 1974 or thereabouts. Interest in the question has given rise to some controversy as well. Terrestrial telecommunication engineers, especially of the Indian Posts and Telegraph Department and All India Radio (AIR), are reported to have taken exception to the much-publicised claim of the space scientists that a satellite would enable India to erect a truly nation-wide TV system at a fraction of the cost which would arise in case traditional TV technology were to be employed. Likewise, the proponents of such media as can act as close substitutes for television - notably radio and movie projectors - have challenged the need for developing an expensive medium like television in India. Individuals have questioned the need for developing a nation-wide TV system on grounds such as (a) TV is a luxury not needed at the present juncture of India's state of development and (b) harmful side-effects of TV may follow as in the Western countries. Yet, barring some debate in the press, the controversial questions about national television have not received any attention in academic circles. More notably, economists who can help settle controversy about choice of techniques are nowhere in the picture. The thinking in this article is based on the author's doctoral work, "Economics of Satellite TV for India", completed in May 1972.||B. D. Dhawan

10/11/1973- ||special articles||4363178||The Joint Sector||To use the term Joint Sector to cover all investments made by public sector financial institutions in private sector industry would so widen the scope of the concept as to make it almost meaningless. The term should cover only concerns in which a substantial chunk of equity, say, one-third to one-half, is controlled, as a matter of deliberate policy, by the government and public financial institutions. Had the government followed the recommendation implied in the Dutt Committee's report and provided for the retrospective conversion of public financial institutions' loans into equity, in almost all the top companies the equity under government control would have been substantial and their conversion into Joint Sector enterprises would have been that much easier. Such a structural change, together with ceilings on land and urban property, can help create an environment in which basic changes in economic and administrative policies may be possible. Once the largest companies in the economy no longer belong to private industrial empires, there need be no inhibition regarding permitting them to grow. Economies of scale and the necessity to promote competition where possible will then become the main considerations governing decisions regarding the size of industrial units. Distortions such as encouraging uneconomically small units or not utilising the technical and economic growth potential of existing large units, which mar industrial policy at present, will then become necessary.||H.

Such an identification, however, is not easy as the whole country bears marks of underdevelopment. For this reason, a composite index of development based on co-variation in various indicators of development is constructed for each state. Based on this index the states are grouped into three categories - the most developed, the not so developed, and the least developed. A comparison between the early fifties and the early sixties shows that the groups continued to contain broadly the same states, suggesting that regional disparities have not been reduced in the course of 15 years of planning.||S.

They enrich individuals, but have disastrous effects on the productive system: they contribute to an accusatory atmosphere, they direct enterprise into channels other than the productive ones, they perpetuate scarcities and they militate against the collection, processing and dissemination, of data. The author briefly reviews the fate of reforms that have proceeded on the assumption that the machinery can be made to work better by shuffling a few organisation boxes, by re-routing slips, or by instituting special committees. The reasons on account of which the system works the way it does are sketched and it is argued that since the system is incorrigible, we must think of achieving our objectives by instruments other than the administrative fiat.||Arun Shourie

The Special Schemes are to work within the given framework and will be totally dependent on the existing institutions for their effective functioning. They do not pretend to change the production strategy which implicitly recognises only the well-endowed farmer as a source of growth. They also do not contemplate any radical changes in the procedures and policies of rural institutions which again because of their bias for the better-off sections have neglected the small man. In the circumstances, their direct support to the rural poor through widening their production base would be conditioned largely by the absence of worthwhile and viable side-activities in keeping with the small man's farm-level infrastructure. Their indirect help to the rural poor through area specific schemes through strengthening the infrastructure would have a built-in tendency to encourage leakages to the better-off. The Agencies meant for the poor would thus not be serving the exclusive interests of the poor.||N. S. Jodha

03/11/1973- ||special articles||4363157||The Satyashodhak Samaj and Peasant Agitation||The non-Brahman movement in Maharashtra, the author has argued in an earlier article ('Development of the Maharashtrian Class Structure, 1818 to 1931', Special Number, August 1973), represented a peasant-based 'mass' movement of the bahujan samaj against the shetji-bhatji class consisting of the intelligentsia and the moneylender-landlords. This hypothesis, however, is contrary to the prevailing view of the development of Indian social-political systems, which sees the process as one of a transfer of power from an urban-based upper-caste elite to an only slightly lower, rural-based landholding 'dominant caste'. Instead of class conflict, the model generally in use has been that of conflict between opposing elites. Given the very considerable inequality in landholding throughout the colonial period, a stratum of 'rich' peasants among non-Brahmans did exist. It is also true that this stratum, together with the educated class of non-Brahmans and some merchants, provided the basis of support for the non-Brahman political party. It is similarly true that important tensions existed between caste Hindu non-Brahmans and untouchables, particularly in the villages. Finally, the Maharashtrian class structure today does appear to present a clear case of dominance of a consolidated rich peasant class in fairly comfortable co-existence with the intelligentsia and urban capitalists. But it would be a mistake to analyse this historical process in oversimplified terms. It is erroneous to read back the present structure of class dominance in Maharashtra into the early twentieth century. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the 'rich' peasants did not represent a consolidated class whose interests were in conflict with those of tenants and poor peasants. Similarly, while the rural cooperatives are an important base of the power of the rural elite today, before 1930 they primarily served the 'middle' peasantry. Again, while the non-Brahman party did represent rural elite interests in the legislative council and the local boards, it also provided a basically democratic thrust that was in the interest of all non-Brahmans and maintained a fair degree of alliance with the untouchables in the 1920s. The position taken in this paper, therefore, is that the non-Brahman movement as a whole was a mass movement, that it failed in terms of its goals, and that the consolidation of a rural elite which tended to monopolise the gains of the movement occurred primarily after the failure of the movement and as a result of its inability to overcome the basic structures of the colonial situation. To gain insight into the connection of the Satyashodhak Samaj with general peasant interests, the author here examines (i) the writings of Mukundrao Patil as a leading Satyashodhak ideologist; (ii) the ideology of Satyashodhak tamashas; (iii) the involvement of Satyashodhak activists in a tenants' rebellion in Satara district in 1919-21; and (iv) the leadership role of non-Brahmans in an agitation primarily of poor peasants against the government's Small Holdings Bill in 1927.||Gail Omvedt

It is this section which has successfully managed to give the appearance of having a wide social interest to a movement which obviously represents the sectional interest of a small group. In the course of the fight for the competing claims of the petty bourgeois of the two regions of Andhra Pradesh the wider interests of the state and the nation are being forgotten. The preservation of the integrity of Andhra Pradesh calls for the burden caused by the mulki rules to be shared by the country as a whole. The cost in terms of loss of jobs to the people of the Andhra region, due to the implementation of the mulki rules, cannot number more than 2,000 per annum and the financial costs of off-setting this loss would roughly amount to a maximum of two crores of rupees per annum. Over a five-year period the burden of the Government of India would be Rs 10 crores and this is very little for the Centre to bear in relation to the gains of an integrated Andhra Pradesh for the country. The petty bourgeois in Telengana should be told unequivocally that at the end of this period, they will not be entitled to the privileges which are not conferred on other backward regions. A dialogue, on this basis, between the leaders of both the regions under the auspices of the Central leaders could contribute to the restoration of normalcy in Andhra Pradesh.||G. Parthasarathy,K. V.

10/3/1973- ||special articles||4362402||The Dollar Devaluation and India's Balance of Payments||This paper examines some of the consequences of the devaluation of the US dollar of February and the decision of the Government of India on the exchange rate of the rupee on the major items of India's Balance of Payments. The problems and opportunities emerging from the present devaluation of the dollar are analysed. It is concluded that the new rupee rate, implying 3.7 per cent revaluation against the US dollar, is likely to affect Indian exports to the US only marginally. The effective depreciation of the rupee vis-a-vis major European currencies (excluding the pound sterling with which the rupee is linked at the present for defining the central rate of the rupee) and Japan is likely to lead to increase in our exports to these countries. On the other hand, the total costs of our imports are likely to increase due to the substantial revaluations of these very currencies. Our trade balance may, therefore, actually show unfavourable change in the short run. This leads to the need for vigorous measures at promoting our exports. In view of the fact that many developing countries who are our competitors in the US market are likely to go along with the devaluation of the dollar by the same amount, we cannot afford to revalue the rupee substantially against the dollar. We should wait and see the experience of the floating pound sterling and the performance of the dollar in the near future and also know more abaut the exchange rate decisions of our major competitors in trade before fixing the new parity of the rupee in terms of gold to serve our national interest in the best possible manner.||Charan D.

For Whom?||This paper raises certain fundamental issues about the functioning of the stock market, with particular reference to the market for equities. It advocates an entirely new and more rational approach to the whole concept of stock market liquidity and suggests an empirical method for developing quantitative norms relating to the desirable levels of speculative transactions in securities. In the light of the more realistic concept of liquidity advocated by us and the empirical data presented, the paper attempts to re-examine the rationale of forward trading in shares. The findings have important bearing on the formulation of government policy towards stock market speculation.||L. C. Gupta,J. K. Rohatgi

14/7/1973- ||special articles||4362848||Television in India: Retrospect and Prospect||This article attempts a critique of official thinking on television in a historical context. The proposals of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting are examined for their design and basic assumptions in the context of the prevailing socio-political constraints. An attempt is also made to present in outline a feasible plan for TV in the Fifth Plan. The author concludes that the current plans of the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting for development of television in the seventies need to be scaled down of the egalitarian goals set by the Planning Commission for the Fifth Plan are to carry conviction. The Fifth Plan outlay an TV may need to be restricted to around Rs 60 crores (at 1971 prices) of which one fourth may be specifically earmarked for the provision of 50,000 community TV receivers.||B.

21/4/1973- ||special articles||4362561||Curbing Concentration of Economic Power: A Critique of the New Licensing Policy||The new industrial licensing policy announced in February this year gives the impression of retaining intact the basic features of the policy announced in 1970 with regard to curbing the concentration of economic power. Thus investment proposals of the large business houses are to continue to be subject to licensing regardless of their size and these houses are to be normally permitted to invest only in the core sector. The rigour of application of both these restrictions has, however, been substantially diluted by, first, the change made in the definition of what constitutes a business house and, second, the revision of the list of core industries open to large houses. If these vital features of the new industrial licensing policy are adequately taken into account, the conclusion is unavoidable that the objective of curbing the growth of large business houses and checking concentration of economic powers now occupies a lowly place in the government's scheme of priorities.||A.

31/3/1973- ||special articles||4362488||India and the International Copyright Conventions||It is clear by now that India's membership of the international copyright conventions has yielded it less benefit than it has taken away. What the conventions safeguard is not so much the author's right to reward and protection of intellectual property, but the commercial interests of the foreign copyright owners and publishers. What they amount to is the Western countries claiming an unrestricted right to exploit our markets, retarding in the process the development of indigenous book manufacturing activities. Past experience has shown that the advanced countries will brook no change in the provisions of the conventions which may limit their right in this respect. India and other similarly placed countries should, therefore, seriously consider withdrawing themselves from these conventions.||Jaman H. Shah

It has been contended, on this ground, that tax concessions linked to investment of capital are inappropriate in a labour surplus and capital scarce economy like ours. This article argues that, contrary to the above belief, development rebate is largely neutral between techniques of varying capital intensities.||L. C. Gupta

03/3/1973- ||special articles||4362385||Unemployment in India||This paper is devoted to a discussion of the unemployment in the country which has defied solution despite two decades of planned development. The author attempts an explanation of the phenomenon of a positive growth in unemployment associated with a positive growth in output. He begins by trying to clarify some issues in the unending controversy about the definition and measurement of unemployment in a dominantly agrarian household economy. In this context are presented some numbers, computed from National Sample Survey (NSS) data, which may be regarded as fair approximations of the unemployment in the country in 1971. Finally, the author discusses the most important question of the policy-mix which may be required in the Fifth and subsequent Plans to eliminate the scourge of unemployment. Although the rural and urban unemployment problems are related, the argument of this paper focuses on the more massive rural problem, except where the determination of employment in the economy as a whole is discussed. The word 'unemployment' is used throughout the paper so as to include underemployment, except where it is specifically necessary to distinguish between the two.||Raj Krishna
29/9/1973- ||special articles||4363070||Family Planning: Differential Performance of States||This paper aims to critically examine the Indian Family Planning Programme and to look at the performance of the states to see how the family planning performance is related to the states' socio-economic development. The findings substantiate the fact that states which do well generally in economic development also do well in family planning performance. There are vicious circles of underdevelopment, and states which have broken these barriers are on the path of development, including in their attempts to bring about a reduction in birth rate. On the basis of their family planning performance, Indian states have been grouped into three categories as good, medium, and poor. Correlation co-efficients of individual states, using their family planning performance with various socio-economic and programme indicators, have been computed. Regression and analysis of variance have also been used on a limited scale.||Bhaskar D. Misra

Tenancy reform, security of tenancy for tenants and conferment of ownership on them and ceiling on land holdings have all remained illusory.

While the part that social structure has played in these matters is notable, the roles played by particular men and, equally important, the contingent nature of those roles, need to be emphasised. For, contrary to that school of political analysis which attributes much stability to the past, the political history of Kolhapur embodies the search for additional bases of power, conditioned, no doubt, by the social structures and technological possibilities of an era but significantly independent of them. The result is that those men of ambition who are able and willing to enter into political life can influence the actions of others and direct the course of events of their times, if only on the small stage provided by local political activity. What should be stressed here is that by 1962 to speak of the bases of political power in Kolhapur district, meant not only to refer to those with formal power in state or local legislative bodies, or to men with a voice in the district party, but also to those most active in the new economic institutions of the district - institutions which drew upon governmental financing organised under the guise of co-operative economic activity. Indeed, so important have the major co-operative institutions become as political arenas in their own right - for they have control of important financial resources which can be manipulated to the advantage of individuals or political groups - that contests for control of bodies like the district board, do not seem to raise as basic or potential a threat to the positions of major political leaders as do challenges to their control of taluka and district co-operative institutions. Part I examines these political processes upto the merger of Kolhapur state with independent India. Part II deals with the highly personalised style of Kolhapur politics during the period 1947-67. Part III looks at the trends towards routinisation and institutionalisation of Kolhapur politics during the past few years.||Donald B. Rosenthal

We cannot, in this context, speak of the whole of India, nor even of the whole of a state sometimes. What we need to do is to focus attention on specific areas of opportunity. This may seem a simple problem, but since the spending of large sums of money on advertising and distribution hinges on it, this is a major decision for any company to take. This note discusses some of the relevant features of the rural environment in India, the criteria for selection of rural markets and the major problems of selling to these markets.||S. L. Rao

The productivity of Indian Airlines in 1972 was less than half that of all IATA carriers in 1955. Indian Airlines has one of the highest labour costs of all airlines although the average remuneration of its employees is one of the lowest. At the same time, statistics show that Indian Airlines has already reached a level of mechanisation comparable to that of sophisticated foreign airlines.||L. F. R. Cabral

It is argued here that this trend in prices must be attributed to the policies followed by the government.

It is shown that both these instruments have been used to further a policy that favours the large farmers, particularly of the Punjab-Haryana region.||N. Krishnaji

1/2/1973- ||approaches to the approach||4362304||'Socialism' or 'State Capitalism'?||The words 'socialism' or 'socialist society' hardly occur anywhere in the Approach document after the initial paragraph on Basic Objectives. This is probably as it should be. The policy framework consistent with the tasks set out in the Approach document is essentially one of building up genuine Indian capitalism, with the State capitalist sector playing an important and critical role. Reduction of inequalities and elimination of destitution, breaking up undue concentration of economic power and calling a halt to foreign exploitation, encouraging competition and the development of small and medium entrepreneurs-these can hardly be called socialist changes in any real sense of the term. If saying that we aim at attaining socialism politically helps to bring about the changes that are feasible and necessary for moving towards the next stage of development, there is no harm in using the term. But at least in our own understanding it is necessary to be quite clear that at this stage we are not, and probably are incapable of, aiming at socialism. State capitalism is the next step.||H. K.

Such a finding could well become the basis of policy formulation for affecting the growth of banks. This article questions the hypothesis of a U-shaped marginal cost curve. It argues that the conclusion about the optimum scale for Indian banks is not based on firm statistical ground and that it suffers from an aggregation bias. What is required is not a global minimum for all ranges of deposit size, but local minima for different ranges of deposits-so that branches can be grouped according to certain ranges of deposit size and can converge to their group's optimum size.||Dalip S.

24/11/1973- ||special articles||4363225||Political Economy of Socialist Development in China since 1949||Chinese economic history over the last two decades shows a particularly striking contrast between two fundamentally different views of socialist development. This article attempts to highlight these differences. The author has also tried to suggest that the Maoist model of development - with its emphasis on reducing economic, social and status differentials and on mass participation - has important implications not only for other socialist countries and for the underdeveloped countries, but also for the developed capitalist countries of Europe and North America. In sections I-VI the author examines the relevance of the Chinese economic experience and the nature of the statistical information available on China. He then describes the state of the Chinese economy which was inherited by the new communist regime in 1949, and gives a broad outline of Chinese economic development since then, discussing its essential features.

It then generates data which are of immense significance, as if they were the results of controlled experiments in a laboratory. With this presumption we have looked into the performance of the Indian economy through the decades of the fifties and the sixties, and especially during the current industrial recession. An attempt is made to put together certain relevant facts with a view to answering certain questions relating to the existence and performance of the middle bourgeoisie in India, the role of the state and the nature of penetration of foreign capital. The recession has unequivocally driven home the peril of the middle bourgeoisie in India. To the extent they can be identified with the small and medium private and public limited companies, the middle bourgeoisie earn a relatively low rate of profit on net worth; and what is more, the profit is extremely volatile. They are being pushed by the big bourgeoisie into a tighter corner day by day; and so they are turning to the foreign capitalists for protection in one form or another. To put it differently, the differentiation of the bourgeoisie is going apace in India; and that is paving the way for foreign capital all the more. The big bourgeoisie, on the other hand, have certainly improved their position in spite of the ups and downs in the economy, or perhaps as a result of these fluctuations. They are giving out a secularly declining share of output as wages; that is to say, their rate of exploitation of labour is mounting. Meanwhile, whenever a crisis arises in industry they pass the brunt in the main to the workers who now get a still smaller share of output. An important question is: Why don't the big bourgeoisie then go on accumulating at an ever increasing rate? Plenty of labour is available at a low wage rate which can furthermore be made to bear the burden of economic crises as and when they occur. Besides, the state is placing in the hands of affluent consumers a large, steady stream of purchasing power to create a guaranteed market. Why then do the big bourgeoisie stop short of breaking the barrier of low investment in the economy? The answer lies in the fact that for realising an ever increasing volume of surplus value the stepping up of the rate of exploitation of labour is as much effective as the acceleration of the rate of capital accumulation. So the big bourgeoisie in India have struck an 'optimal' balance between a moderate rate of capital accumulation and an increasing rate of exploitation of labour, which serves their interests with splendid efficiency. And in this sense, the Indian economy is certainly on an efficient, optimal growth path that spells immiserisation for the masses and bonanza for the few!||Ranjit Sau

While it was recognised that there were backward economies that were not labour surplus, there never was any supposition that the Indian economy was one of them. However, this universally held idea has been under attack during the last several years. The challenging view would have it that the labour surplus is illusory; that traditional agriculture is efficient enough to make full use of the total supply of labour in agriculture. This paper seeks, first, to bring out the questionable logic that is involved in the no-surplus-labour argumentation and, second, to present the results of an exercise in direct observation and measurement of labour in relation to agriculture carried out on a sample of farming families.||Ashok Rudra
24/2/1973- ||special articles||4362363||Priorities for a Tax Programme||Devising an optimal tax system when there is a multiplicity of aims to be pursued and especially when there is no very easily definable trade-off between some of the aims-such as between growth and distributive justice, or between growth and employment-is by no means easy. In the circumstances, attempts at rationalisation of the tax structure have often amounted to piecemeal engineering on particular taxes without much attention being paid to the overall effects on the economic system. The structure of direct taxation in India typifies this approach. Yet, if the task is to be properly undertaken, a clear enunciation of the goals is necessary so that the weights to be attached to each of the objectives are clearly specified. Given the overall goal of growth with social justice, there is no escape from a heavy reliance on taxation. Among the personal taxes, income-tax appears to be the best instrument, provided the base is wide enough, Considerations of administrative capacity and tax-payers' attitudes, however, suggest that exclusive reliance on income-tax would not be wise. The scope for supplementing the income-tax with levies on commodities which do not form part of common consumption, needs to be more fully explored.||Amaresh Bagchi

31/3/1973- ||review of agriculture, march 1973||4362479||A Charter for the Land||The habit of considering land as incidental to narrowly conceived departmental schemes instead of as a single indivisible resource which needs attention in its own right lies at the back of many of our troubles and must be rooted out. Today, the irrigation engineer looks at land as something either to water or to drain (but rarely both), the agricultural soil conservation engineer as something to terrace and bund, the forester as something to grow trees on, and the planner as something which can create largescale employment opportunities - whether for the skilled or the unskilled, whether for landless or the small farmer, whether in wet or dry conditions and whether on a crash or a continuing basis. We thus have a multiplicity of agencies each of which is necessarily interested only in implementing its own schemes without reference to the others and none of which can see the picture as a whole. This is a situation which can be corrected only by creating organisations that can take a synoptic and a sympathetic view of the needs of the land so that these may be catered to in a direct, deliberate and efficient manner. The management of land and soil resources is indissolubly linked with the management of water resources and cannot therefore be attempted without subjecting the latter to some discipline. It is because such discipline has been absent in the past that so little attention has been paid by our irrigation projects to the problems of sedimentation, water-logging and proper water utilisation. It will be necessary to ensure in the future that while on the one hand no new projects are taken up which do not give enough attention to these aspects, energetic steps are also taken on the other hand to remedy such deficiencies in the case of existing and on-going projects. Such a policy will not result in any shrinkage of employment opportunities for engineers, as feared by some, but rather in their expansion. A sound land policy will therefore automatically lead to a sound water policy which lays more emphasis on the development of ground water resources and insists on much more care with regard to surface water schemes. There is little doubt that such a policy will bring about a close working relationship at various levels between the proposed land authorities and the organisations which deal with the development of water resources, both ground and surface. In the fullness of time, the remorseless logic of circumstances will complete this process by demanding the creation of a Department of Land and Water in the Ministry of Agriculture at the Centre and of similar arrangements in the states. In due course, responsibility for various other neglected aspects of the ecological environment will also inevitably get drawn to such departments. Let us, however, take only one small step at a time.||B. B. Vohra

It is suggested that the income unemployed tend to be a subset of the production unemployed or surplus labour. The author examines the estimates of unemployment made by the Census, 1961, and the NSS and argues that they probably underestimate unemployment and underemployment to a serious degree, mainly because they underestimate the amount of labour force available for work. The author makes some assumptions regarding availability and estimates the aggregate amount of unemployment and underemployment in the rural areas of the country. These estimates are compared with some other estimates of surplus labour. Finally, it is argued that wasted labour power due to undernutrition is as important an aspect of surplus labour as lost labour time. The author surveys some evidence which indicates the degree of shortfall in the calorific intake in India.||S. K. Rao

The decline has been particularly conspicuous and continuous during the period 1965-66 to 1970-71. This, it is significant, was a period of slow industrial growth. At the same time, profit margins appear to have improved after 1968-69. Total cost as a proportion of value of production has declined, primarily due to the decline in the relative cost of wages. Return on capital has improved significantly, surpassing in 1970-71 the 1965-66 level and to some extent even those of 1960-61 and 1961-62.||S. L. Shetty

1/2/1973- ||development and underdevelopment||4362294||Western Imperialism and India Today-I||This paper attempts to investigate a few related aspects of the manifold economic ties between India and the Western powers. Much of the present structure of relationships has been historically determined by nearly two centuries of British rule. Yet the attainment of political freedom by India and most other countries in the Third World has bred the illusion that the latter group of countries ipso facto pursue their national interests in their dealings with ex-masters. The present paper seriously questions such a belief. It begins by attempting a summary appraisal of foreign aid programmes in general, especially of the US - questioning its true significance both in financial and in real terms, the donors' motives for giving aid (a topic surprisingly overlooked by Third World scholars), and the real or opportunity costs to the donors. Sections II and III, continue the same line of argument to show the contrast between the 'face' value and the 'real' value of foreign aid to India. Section IV questions whether foreign aid was essential in any meaningful sense to India's economic development. It is argued that (i) the transfer of 'real' resources has been only a small fraction of the gross aid flows, and that (ii) even if the extent of transfer was large, it was by no means indispensable. Indeed, the easy availability of foreign aid postponed some vital structural changes which might have largely obviated the need for foreign aid. Sections V - VII are devoted to foreign private capital, and indicate the magnitude of foreign exchange drain due to the foreign sector, its domineering role in the organised private sector, and the new web of relationships it has woven with Indian capital. Towards the end of Section VII we come to the premises of a liberal 'open technology' policy. Section VIII brings into focus the much wider implications of a choice of technology in the Indian context. An 'exports first' strategy, combined with a free inflow of the most advanced form of Western technology, will it is argued, warp the very foundations of the development process. The final section attempts a preliminary outline of an alternative policy in regard to technology. Sections I - VII are printed here. Sections VIII and IX will appear in the issue of February 17.||N.

31/3/1973- ||review of agriculture, march 1973||4362482||On the Essence and Manifestation of Capitalism in Indian Agriculture||The question of the degree and trend of capitalist development arises in the context of defining the strategy and tactics of class struggle. The basic question, then, is twofold: (a) whether and to what extent capitalism has already penetrated and is penetrating Indian agriculture and industry; and (b) whether capitalism can develop in India, and if it develops what its character would be. The nature, extent and trend of the development of capitalism in agriculture as much as in industry in any country in all historical periods are necessarily and fully manifested in the existing class relations and the dynamics thereof, which in turn dialectically interacts with the pace of capitalist development. To have a look at the data of wage-labour and/or of the capital stock, without any analysis of the underlying class relations, and to pronounce on its basis on the extent and trend of the development of capitalism is to betray ignorance about the essence of capitalism in the sense of Marx.||Ranjit Sau

Labour, and female labour especially, is most exploited in the tea industry. Its is the most significant contribution to the profits of the industry; yet the returns to it in terms of wages are abysmally low. The share of labour compares very unfavourably with the profits of the proprietor, the dividends of the shareholder and the earnings of the manager. And the share of the female worker compares unfavourably even with that of her male counterpart in the same plantation. The reasons for this absurd discrimination are historical and its persistence after Independence, while inconsistent with the government's professed ideology, is perfectly understandable given the country's economic system. This paper seeks to show how labour, particularly female labour, is made to create surplus value in the tea industry in two ways: (1) by unfair techniques used to raise the productivity of labour; and (2) by underpayment of wages.||Manorama Savur

26/5/1973- ||special articles||4362669||From Reformist Princes to 'Co-operative Kings': II: The Personalisation of Kolhapur Politics: 1947-67||This paper examines how the character of political relationships in Kolhapur state/district has changed during the past century and what the present pattern of political leadership in that district looks like. While the part that social structure has played in these matters is notable, the roles played by particular men and, equally important, the contingent nature of those roles, needed to be emphasised. For, contrary to that school of political analysis which attributes much stability to the past, the political history of Kolhapur embodies the search for additional bases of power, conditioned, no doubt, by the social structures and technological possibilities of an era but significantly independent of them. The result is that those men of ambition who are able and willing to enter into political life can influence the actions of others and direct the course of events of their times, if only on the small stage provided by local political activity. What should be stressed here is that by 1962 to speak of the bases of political power in Kolhapur district, meant not only to refer to those with formal power in state or local legislative bodies, or to men with a voice in the district party, but also to those most active in the new economic institutions of the district-institutions which drew upon governmental financing organised under the guise of co-operative economic activity. Indeed, so important have the major co-operative institutions become as political arenas in their own right-for they have control of important financial resources which can be manipulated to the advantage of individuals or political groups-that contests for control of bodies like the district board, do not seem to raise as basic or potential a threat to the positions of major political leaders as do challenges to their control of taluka and district co-operative institutions. Part II deals with the highly personalised and factional style of politics between 1947 and 1967. Part I examined the political processes in Kolhapur state prior to its merger with independent India. Part III will look at the trends towards routinisation and institutionalisation of Kolhapur politics during the past few years.||Donald B. Rosenthal

The strategy for achieving this objective has to be two-pronged. On the supply side, the volume and composition of output consistent with the consumption targets have to be planned for. On the demand side, the plan investments have to be such that they generate the required income for the poor. The Approach document recognises the need for both, but in its exercise it concentrates on the former only. Thus the rates of growth for different sectors and the investments needed to achieve these rates of growth have been worked out in a detailed manner. But no comparable exercise or information is presented on how the required income is to be generated for the poor. An investment plan which can achieve the required volume and composition of output does not necessarily generate the desired income for the poor. What we need is an investment plan which provides the needed goods and services as well as generates the required income for the poor to enable them to buy the goods made available.||C. H.

1/2/1973- ||approaches to the approach||4362302||Approach to the Fifth Plan: First Impressions||The Approach to the Fifth Plan describes two alternative patterns of growth, one based on the assumption that the distribution of consumption expenditure between the different deciles of the population, arranged according to consumption levels, would remain the same as in 1968-69 and the other on the assumption of a major shift in favour of the bottom three deciles of the population. The second variant shows considerable improvement in the balance of payments when compared to the first; and it is 'preferred' both because it entails greater reduction of poverty and for the reason that the goal of zero net aid can be achieved more quickly. The second variant may be dismissed by some as nothing but an arithmetical exercise, the characteristics and implications of which were already well known. This would be neither fair nor correct. It would be more pertinent if one were to ask how precisely the postulated reduction in the consumption of the upper strata of society is to be brought about. One suspects that, unless the Planning Commission has deliberately chosen to hide something very important it has up its sleeve, what it will ultimately come up with may not be so very different from the kind of general recipes that have been offered in the past.||K.

Given the exacerbation of India's relations with the US and the excellence of recent Indo-Soviet relations; given the generally satisfactory aid relationship through which Russian credits had made it possible for India to establish a large number of State sector enterprises; and given the coincidence of views between Soviet marxism-leninism and the bulk of Indian intellectuals concerning the importance of national economic independence, the imperialism of American foreign policy, and the need for State control of the private sector; the expectation behind this research was that Soviet intellectual and policy influence in India would be seen to be considerable. In fact, the research revealed that neither in theory nor in practice have the Soviets had any noticeable impact on the Indian elite's ways of thinking or acting in governmental affairs. The low impact of Soviet writings and policy on Indian thinkers and policy-makers may, however, work to the advantage of the Soviet government, which is more concerned about stability and influence in the subcontinent than ideological converts or policy disciples. While not flattering to Soviet ideologists, India's cool reaction to marxist-leninist ideas may be the best condition for continuing healthy long-term relationship of this country with the Soviet Union. The evidence appears conclusive that, if the influence of marxist-leninist thought is to grow in India, it will be less because of external stimulation, whether from Moscow or any other communist capital, than from the indigenous flowering of a local communist practice and experience of the type seen in Kerala or West Bengal.||Stephen Clarkson

29/9/1973- ||special articles||4363063||Paulo Freire's Method of Education: Conscientisation in Latin America||The term 'conscientisation' epitomises a different approach to educating and mobilising the downtrodden masses which has been tried out in Latin America. This approach can be attributed in large measure to the ideas and work of a Brazilian educationist, Paulo Freire. This article describes Paulo Freire's method of education. The author first briefly introduces Paulo Freire, the man, then talks about the historical background of his work, his method and results and, finally, tries to give a short description of the basic philosophical ideas behind his educational approach. The term 'conscientisation', as used by Paulo Freire, implies action and organisation. The campesinos in the north-east of Brazil were not satisfied that they knew how to read and write: they started forming their own organisations. It was this part of Freire's method that became dangerous to the existing power structure. Paulo Freire is aware of the fact that one cannot change the exsting power structure by making people simply aware of the power structure. A cultural revolution cannot substitute for a political revolution. Freire further holds that a mere change of the power structure without a cultural revolution, i e, without a heightened awareness of the masses, will again repeat the old hierarchical system of domination of man over man. He, therefore, thinks that the cultural revolution - education for the 'new society' - must begin in the 'old society'. But this education can achieve its true aim only if it is part of a larger movement for liberation.||Maria Mies

The first article (May 12) examined the scope of the Finance Commissions under the Constitution and brought out that the Constitution gives the Commissions the maximum freedom to operate in the areas under their purview. The second article (June 23) reviewed the approach of the Finance Commissions which have reported so far to the question of resource transfers between the Centre and the states. The third article (July 21) sought to offer some ideas about how the Sixth Finance Commission may make a departure from the gap-filling approach to Centre-state financial relations adopted by earlier Commissions. The fourth article (August 25) posed three possible alternative approaches for the Sixth Finance Commission. The present article attempts to spell out an alternative scheme of tax devolution and grants and what it means in terms of resource transfer for each state. In the sixth article we shall deal with the question of debt and drought reliefs.||

Additionally, for India the existing system of medical education had two fundamental shortcomings: (a) it was evolved to serve a very small privileged section of the society; and (b) along with the natural science essentials, it carried with it the cultural accretions of the West. To bring about social orientation of medical education in the country, departments of preventive and social medicine were established in medical colleges. The teachers of preventive and social medicine have, however, conspicuously failed in meeting the challenge. At best they have ended up by putting in the old wine of hygiene and public health in the new bottle of preventive and social medicine.||D. Banerji

It was with this in view that, more than a decade ago, an estimate was attempted of income-tax avoidance taking place through use of the present provisions of the tax law relating to the Undivided Hindu Family, for the years 1957-58 and 1958-59. This paper seeks principally to bring those estimates upto date. In addition, attempts to quantify the gains to revenue likely to accrue from adopting either the Raj Committee's recent recommendation for a total derecognition of the HUF as a tax entity or the Wanchoo Committee's recommendation made more than one year ago for higher rates on HUF incomes.||I.

Three major problems emerge from Beteille's paper on participant observation, the implications of which I propose to examine in this paper: (i) By what criteria does the researcher select his community or small group for study? (ii) Does the researcher enter the field first and then let the investigation take shape, or does he approach the field with a 'clearly formulated plan of investigation'? (iii) What indeed is the method of participant observation, and how are we to assess its utility in the Indian context?||Partha N. Mukherji

This paper describes the process of creation of this class structure out of the elements of traditional Indian society, the position of the various castes within it and the relationship of this structure to the forms which nationalism and the non-Brahman movement took in Maharashtra. The general effects of colonial land relations were to increase impoverishment and indebtedness and thus to worsen the effects of stratification and to introduce a new fluidity into village society. It was this development that provided the foundation for the unity among all non-Brahman castes that was asserted in the concept of the bahujan samaj. While peasants in the 19th century did not attain consciousness of themselves as a class, it was nevertheless the 19th century colonial society that laid the basis of this consciousness which was to come to the fore in the 20th century.||Gail Omvedt

This paper seeks to analyse the relationship between growth and social justice and to discuss the relevance of existing economic theory to this relationship. While the focus is more on the theoretical issues involved, the discussion is related to the current Indian situation.||K. R. Ranadive

In the Third Plan's Rural Works Programmes in the Crash Scheme for Rural Employment started in 1971-72, in the Pilot Intensive Rural Employment Project launched in 1972-73, and in Maharashtra's Employment Guarantee Scheme, we already have some experience of rural works programmes. This article focuses, in the light of this experience and the characteristics of the weaker sections, on the several research issues and variables that deserve careful attention in the planning of future employment programmes in rural areas. Its findings underline that the critical problem is productivity of available employment rather than open unemployment; that there is no clear distinction between the ranks of small cultivators and of uncultivating wage-earners; that there are important regional variations even within the states; that the location of and the wage rates offered by the works programmes would be significant factors in effective employment creation; and that substantial efforts would have to go into strengthening the organisational capacities for formulating and implementing the various programmes. It also suggests lines along which further research would prove useful.||Pravin Visaria,Leela Visaria

This rebate, as already announced by the Union Finance Minister (Part B, budget speech, 1971-72), will no longer be available on qualifying investment made after May 31, 1974. Thus, by the time it is abolished, development rebate will have been in existence for nearly two decades. The question naturally arises, what are the possible consequences of its abolition on new capital formation and on replacement of assets in industries. Should some alternative incentives be introduced? If so, what form should such alternatives take? The present paper is an attempt to answer some of these questions. The paper is arranged in three sections. A brief history of development rebate and its inducement effect, are discussed in Section I; the estimated saving in tax liability is also indicated in this section. Likely consequences of its abolition on new industrial investment and replacement of assets are examined in Section II. The final section indicates a possible approach to the problem of incentives and some broad alternatives which could be considered in this regard.||N. J. Jhaveri

The statement of objects of the latest Companies Act Amendment Bill refers to changes incorporated in the Companies Act of 1956 by the amending Acts of 1960, 1965 and 1969. There have been other amending Acts in 1956, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1967 and 1968. And even before the present amending legislation could complete the legislative circuit, proposals have been mooted for yet another amendment of the Companies Act. Company law administration in India evidently does not have much respect for the basic approach of the Jenkins Committee in UK which had pointed out that it was advisable "not to disturb longstanding provisions unless they have outlived their usefulness" and that "those who claim that the law should be altered should make out their case". The statement of objects and reasons attached to the Bill cites as reason for bringing forward the Bill: "Cases of abuse or distortion of the system have of late assumed comparatively serious proportions." How far is this allegation in the statement of objects warranted by facts? What is the precise nature of the alleged serious abuses? Why is there little significant public discussion of these abuses? In which respects are the existing powers (enlarged from 1956 to 1970) not sufficient to prevent these abuses or to take appropriate penal action against the offenders?||Madan Gopal Jajoo
28/4/1973- ||special articles||4362584||Non-Brahmans and Communists in Bombay||This paper studies the radical working class movement which emerged in Bombay in the late 1920s and which brought together, in curious fashion, an emerging communist leadership with the leaders of the largely peasant-based non-Brahman movement. The ambiguities and outcome of these contacts and conflicts were decisive not only for the development of social radicalism but also for the direction of the nationalist movement in Maharashtra. While the focus of the paper is on the Bombay working class, the larger issue is the relationship of the 'cultural revolutionary' non-Brahman movement with nationalism and communism. The purpose is to provide some additional insight into why the nationalist movement in India consolidated itself under a conservative leadership. The first part of the paper, which appeared last week, showed how caste elitism was a major barrier to the spread of the Maharashtrian communist movement. Receptivity to a radical ideology existed among both urban and rural areas, but an anti-communist and conservative section of the non-Brahman elite was also there, ready to take advantage of any failure of the communists. These failures, along with the effectiveness of British repression, were decisive. However, the genuine possibilities that did exist for a consolidation of communist strength not only among the working class but also to some degree in the rural areas are illustrated by the influence of the workers' movement on Dinkarrao Javalkar. In this, the concluding part of the article, the author examines the role of Dinkarrao Javalkar.||Gail Omvedt

1/2/1973- ||development and underdevelopment||4362292||On the Political Economy of Underdevelopment||While primary accumulation destroyed the pre-capitalist modes in the colonies and semi-colonies, the subsequent development of capitalism was geographically unevenly distributed due to the existence of external economies. Thus development at one pole, the metropolis, was accompanied by underdevelopment at the other, the periphery - the latter characterised by integration into world trade as primary producers and by the existence of a "relative surplus population" which had to survive as best it could. This entire process of development-underdevelopment at an international level took place through the medium of a colonial or comprador State. The pattern was challenged by liberation movements in the "peripheral" countries in many of which the national bourgeoisie emerged as the dominant force. In its efforts to start an indigenous capitalist development, this bourgeoisie could, for instance, have used the vast mass of unutilised labour for capital formation, provided rural institutions had been overhauled; but its political instinct was to ally itself with the landlords and after some patchy land reform settle down to the business of promoting a sort of rural capitalism from above. Since the surplus value generated within the tiny capitalist sector was inadequate, primary accumulation had to supplement it and it took the form of a drastic squeeze on the consumption of the masses. In addition, where the resulting development was concentrated in a certain region, the old metropolis-periphery relationship was reproduced within the country. However, with the rising consumption of the bourgeoisie and the landlords, even this primary accumulation was insufficient and capital had to be borrowed from the metropolitan centres. For political reasons too the bourgeoisie had to realign itself with the metropolitan bourgeoisie soon after Independence. As a result, it soon came under pressure to dismantle the restrictions on trade and foreign capital which had developed since Independence. But such a more "liberal" economic regime is no more likely to bring all-round development than the earlier restrictive one. The regime represents a tendency towards re-establishment, in a more complex form, of the nineteenth century pattern of free trade and free capital movements which was responsible for generating underdevelopment in the first place. Indeed, the so-called "liberalisation" is part of the process of centralisation of capital at an international level and will once again leave the growth of underdeveloped countries open to the vagaries of international capital. At best, even assuming that this capital is moving geographically out of the metropolis, it would make a segment of the underdeveloped country a lateral extension of the metropolis. With minor modifications the technology would roughly be the same as in the metropolis, so that sustained growth even in this segment would leave the problems of labour utilisation and poverty untouched. Hence the current debate among academic economists about the pros and cons of "liberalisation" really centres around the relative roles of national and metropolitan capital. The real question, however, is the extent to which capitalism itself is adequate. This paper argues that capitalist growth in either form will have little impact on the social problems facing underdeveloped countries. The set of institutions required for solving these problems can be created only under a different mode altogether.||Prabhat Patnaik

This was considered necessary because the existing institutions were thought to be dominated by rich farmers and, for that reason, incapable of providing adequate assistance to small farmers. The Small Farmers Development Agency (SFDA) does not directly extend credit to small farmers, but functions as an instrument for stimulating the flow of credit to small farmers from the existing agencies such as co-operative banks, land development banks, commercial banks, etc. This it seeks to do by providing a subsidy equal to 25 per cent of the loans sanctioned to small farmers by these institutions. Thus, for all practical purposes, the SFDA has emerged as a subsidy distributing agency. Except for this function of the SFDA there has been no other change in the institutional set-up for assisting small farmers. This is borne out by the working of the SFDA in the Ambala district of Haryana, studied here.||H. Laxminarayan

Needless to say, in long-term planning, where we look upon educational and instructional television as a component of developmental television, we have to look for and make changes in all these three.||Pramod Kale

Studies in the areas outlined here are either scanty or non-existent. The studies therefore proposed here should be concerned essentially with the following broad questions: (a) Whether a diversion of investment to housing would not in fact benefit the economy from the point of view of raising the rate of savings and levels of employment. (b) What kinds of accommodation (for essential amenities only) should be provided, how should loans be administered, and what special legislation if any is necessary to ensure continuing success. (c) Would the 'incremental' housing programmes suggested here succeed in the face of quite possibly lower priorities being attached by families-especially poorer families-to housing compared to other necessities of urban life; will the fact of provision of improved housing lead to increased migration to these areas. (d) What values of density, and what design parameters besides density should be adopted as guidelines in the broad layout and planning of residential districts.||Shirish B. Patel

29/12/1973- ||review of agriculture, december 1973||4363316||How Green Is the Indian Green Revolution?||The term 'green revolution' suffers from the word 'revolution'. The word revolution stands for a sharp break from the situation that existed before the revolution. It implies also that transformation can be attained quickly. Thus defined, 'revolution' is the milestone around the green revolution's neck and many of the ills ascribed to the green revolution flow from it. But more modestly viewed as evolution in the process of finding a way out of the customary behaviour of traditional agriculture, the green revolution has served the country well, all the constraints notwithstanding. The author goes to considerable lengths to stress the less than cheerful realities of the new technology, and why matters of social significance are beyond its ken. But the new technology's failure to live up to its production potential is centred on the well known proposition that 'nobody has been able to invent a cow which will give milk without being fed'. And this is at the heart of the unrealised potential where the technology is firmly implanted, and why so many crops have not been touched by it. The fault does not lie with the inherent advantages of the technology; their sophistication in raising yields has been proved. Rather, the fault lies with the failure to help them along in a variety of both man-made and natural inadequacies encompassing skills, irrigation facilities allocation of resources, and the whole gamut of physical inputs, research, organisation and communication. The point to stress here is that the existence of a breakthrough away from traditional agriculture is in the making. And it matters not whether one marks it 'revolutionary' or just plain 'evolutionary'.||Wolf Ladejinsky

From the dominating position which they acquired at the time of securing political power, the bourgeoisie headed by big business proceeded to systematically consolidate their power. Against them are ranged the majority of the people, from the rural and urban poor and the unemployed to the better-off lower middle classes going right up to the still better-off rich peasants, small and medium scale entrepreneurs, and so on. It, therefore, passes one's comprehension how India can be described as belonging to the category of intermediate regimes.||E. M. S. Namboodiripad

24/3/1973- ||special articles||4362456||Proletarian Internationalism and the Socialist Camp||Since the warm, honoured-guest treatment given last year to Nixon in Peking and Moscow by the leaders of the communist parties of China and the Soviet Union, at a time when American B-52 bomber planes were blasting life out of existence in Vietnam and when his navy had just ruined and blockaded the major supply ports of North Vietnam, many people have begun to wonder if the classical concept of international proletarianism has not become obsolete, a mere slogan, an idea worthy of no respect. Some have even begun to question the veracity and correctness of this idea on which Marx and Engels had based their epoch-making Communist Manifesto and on the basis of which they had brought into existence the first viable international organisation of the working class. It might, therefore, be worthwhile to examine the importance and the objective roots of the concept of international proletarianism, its vitiation and betrayal by the Soviet bureaucracy after the death of Lenin, and its vulgarisation and misuse by Stalin and his present-day successors, with a view to restoring some of its lost lustre by exposing those who have converted it into a convenient tool for harnessing the world working class and communist movement in the service of their narrow national interests.||Lajpat Rai

The accounting concept of balance of payments, it is now accepted, is both out-dated and unsatisfactory as a tool for analysis of a country's international financial position. This paper suggests a new approach to classification of balance of payments. This approach may provide a better indication of a developing country's creditworthiness as also of its vulnerability in its payment relations. The use of the proposed framework is illustrated by an analysis of India's balance of payments statistics.||Sunanda Sen

The first article (May 12) examined the scope of the Finance Commissions under the Constitution. It was pointed out that the Constitution gives the Commissions the maximum freedom to operate in the areas under their purview. The second article (June 23) reviewed the approach of the earlier Finance Commissions to the question of resource transfers between the Centre and the states. The third article (July 21) sought to offer some ideas about how the Sixth Finance Commission may make a departure from the gap-filling approach to Centre-state financial relations adopted by the earlier Commissions. The fourth article (September 22) attempted to spell out an alternative scheme of tax devolution and grants. This article deals with debt and drought relief, the two additional matters referred to the Sixth Finance Commission. However, the references made to the Commission are so narrowly conceived that satisfactory arrangements in these respects will be hard to devise within the confines of the Commission's terms of reference.||
24/11/1973- ||review of management, november 1973||4363222||Computers without Plan||There are two reasons for urgent consideration of the whole complex of problems surrounding the introduction of computers in India. The first is that, following the termination of the licences for sale of reconditioned computers, there has been a virtual standstill in the introduction of computers. The government is now reported to be engaged in negotiations to provide computers for the Indian market - by direct import on easy credit terms or tied to bilateral agreements, by manufacture in India by foreign companies and by fully indigenous manufacture. The second reason is that the Labour Minister has to take a decision, some time, on the recommendations of the Automation Committee. This decision has to be linked to decisions concerning the supply or manufacture of computers, so that use of computers, their effect on employment, and availability of computers, can be considered as an integrated problem. This will give a clear picture of the national requirement of computers of various types and sizes, and will forestall any conflict between manufacturing programmes and planned employment generation.||

This will require a massive investment in augmenting line, yard and rolling stock capacity. The present fleet of 4 lakh wagons will need to be expanded during the Plan by another 1 lakh wagons. When the Railways are poised for such a massive increase in workload and an investment programme of the order of Rs 3,000 crores, it is most essential to ensure maximum productivity from the existing assets before making new investments. The Railway Board has thus set up a Corporate Planning Cell and has strengthened the planning machinery on the Zonal Railways by appointing Chief Planning Officers. An Operations Research Cell has also been set up in the Railway Board and selected projects, involving Simulation and Model Building, have been assigned to the OR Cell. The role of computers in the management of the Indian Railways has to be seen against this background.||B. V. Rama Rao

20/10/1973- ||special articles||4363134||The Opposition: Problems and Prospects||Due to the fragmented opposition, the only alternative to the continued dominance of the Congress party has been political instability. Congress dominance may be interrupted by an interregnum of decline and resultant instability; this in turn may be followed by the restoration of Congress dominance. Such a scenario of dominance-decline-chaos-restoration may become a recurrent pattern, throwing the system into periodic throes of uncertainty. The development of an effective and meaningful opposition is, therefore, the critical need of the post-1971 political system. But recognition of the need for it does not by itself create a viable opposition. The growth of the opposition would seem to depend upon many factors, such as awareness of the system's needs, proper role-perception, current assessment of the nature of the Congress regime, working out of a sound programmatic and organisational strategy, evolution of a proper political style, and projection of a suitable image. All these require farsighted and imaginative leadership as well as rigorous efforts at political analysis and conceptualisation. The present paper attempts to lay down some major guidelines for such conceptualisation.||Ram Joshi,Kirtidev Desai

30/6/1973- ||review of agriculture, june 1973||4362790||Factors Affecting Wage Rates for Agricultural Labour||Any increase in irrigation and cropping intensity is likely to raise agricultural wages more in an area with a smaller proportion of the rural labour force dependent on wage employment and/or with higher non-agricultural wage rates than in an area where vast masses of tiny peasants and the landless flood the labour market and the non-agricultural sector is too small to absorb much of it. This may not happen if the farmers in the former area resort to using a lot of labour-saving machinery, or the labourers in the latter organise themselves for group bargaining. If the former is characterised by substantial and wide-spread underemployment it would dampen or block entirely the rise in the wage rate. Much of the data studied here indicate that irrigation or multiple cropping does generate a positive response not only in the wage income but also in the daily wage rate for agricultural labourers. It seems that the worst possible combination of factors is to be seen in areas where the labour market is flooded by the virtually landless, the level of agricultural productivity is stagnant, and the non-agricultural employment opportunities too small. This is more or less the case in many parts of Madhya Pradesh, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and any number of pockets in almost every state. The situation is relieved a bit from time to time by migration of labourers. But usually the migration is not large enough, and the wage rates continue to remain depressed. All our crash schemes for rural employment need to be concentrated in these areas of extremely low levels of wages, even if overt unemployment at the prevailing wage rate is not so large in their case, instead of being spread out thinly over the whole country.||Kalpana Bardhan

06/10/1973- ||special articles||4363092||Taxation Laws (Amendment) Bill: Deduction of House Rent and Interest on Tax-Liquidating Loans||Neither of the provisions for deduction from taxable income contained in Clauses 19 and 25 - relating to house rent for non-salary earners and interest on loans taken for paying up taxes - of the Taxations Laws (Amendment) Bill, now before a Select Committee of Parliament, is well founded in principle. Deduction of house rent might improve equity between two groups among tax-payers, but for reasons quite different from those assumed by the Wanchoo Committee. The improvement is likely to result from more even treatment, not of non-salary earners as against salaried employees, but of rent-payers and house-owners. If, however, fresh inequities are to be avoided, account has to be taken of the position of the other groups of tax-payers who will be affected by any change in this regard. All this, if attempted, will cost the exchequer quite dearly and in the process vertical equity would be seriously compromised. The loss in vertical equity and in revenue is unlikely to be requited by any gain in horizontal equity. If the proposed provision is dropped and, at the same time, the existing restriction (of 10 per cent of other income) on the taxable value of the imputed rent of owner-occupied houses is repealed along with the partial exemption of house rent allowance received by employed persons, the total gain to the exchequer could be around Rs 75-80 crores per annum. In the case of deduction of interest on loans taken for paying up taxes, the gain is uncertain while some revenue loss seems inescapable. Apart from the revenue loss, this provision, as also that to allow deduction for expenses on tax litigation, violates the basic tenet of income taxation in that it treats items of expenditure which are essentially personal in nature as cost of earning income.||Amaresh Bagchi

It is not the worst recorded, yet it is bad enough in large areas of the country to create landmarks of misery all of their own for tens of millions of people. Varying in degree of intensity, there are Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and large pockets of Mysore, Orissa, Madhya Pradesh, and parts of UP. Country-wide, the final summing up of the visitations that drought brings in its wake upon stricken states and the consumers of the country in general must be left to the future historian. At the same time, something must be said about its scope and aftermath before this drought becomes just another episode in the long chain of similar episodes.||Wolf Ladejinsky

Fortunately, the controversy did not spread much beyond the city or become a national issue. The subject is inherently an explosive one, nevertheless. Vande Mataram aroused popular emotions for decades before Independence. All the greater reason, then, why the issues in the controversy, which has been associated with the song almost since its inception, should be calmly and objectively appraised. These issues affected the national movement in the past and they are relevant today in the process of nation-building.||A. G. Noorani

On a theoretical level the assumptions found in development literature with regard to what influences and conditions production decisions and performance among farmers will be examined. Secondly, an attempt will be made to examine current trends of agricultural development with an eye to its differential effects and the consequences on the structure of agrarian society and mass participation in the development process as indicated by the problems of unemployment, displacement and income disparities. Focus will be placed on the organisation of production, as it is that domain of economic activity which is being most affected, and out of which the new problems of development have emerged. It is also in that domain that solutions to these problems are to be sought.||Barry H. Michie

25/8/1973- ||special articles||4362957||Emerging Farmer-Labour Relations in Kuttanad||The first democratically elected Communist government in India came to power in Kerala in 1957. Though this government was overthrown in 1969, another communist-dominated leftist government came to power in the state in 1967, and since then coalition governments led by either the Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM) or the Communist Party of India (CPI) have been ruling the state. The emergence of communism as a major political force in Kerala is a manifestation of fundamental changes taking place in its social structure. This paper endeavours to describe the changes that have occurred in the farmer-labour relations in Kuttanad, in the old princely state of Travancore, and to identify some of the factors which contributed to these changes. The changes in farmer-labour relations in Kuttanad may not be at the moment typical of the whole of Kerala, but this may be indicative of the pattern of relationship likely to emerge between these two important sections of the rural community in Kerala, and probably in other parts of India, in future.||K.

It was only in late Indian feudalism, when the landlords began to cultivate their lands directly to assert their economic indentity and to maintain their armed retainers, that slaves began to appear. Even so, slavery never became an indispensable economic force. Conforming to this general pattern, agricultural work in Bengal during the period reviewed in this article was done chiefly by hired labourers and bond-servants as well as peasants. In some instances only did slaves become a sizeable source of labour.||Hiranmay Dhar

It appears at first sight that there was a general rise in the share of agriculture (though the 'shift from cultivators to agricultural labour is dubious), a rise in the share of manufacturing involving the substitution of household by non-household enterprises, and a rise in the spheres of trade and commerce and transport, storage and communications. There appears to have been a very substantial decline in other services. Even if we could add to our estimates for 1971 all those who would have been included under the 1961 concept but were excluded from the working force due to the narrower 1971 definition, the broad distribution would probably turn out to be much the same. But if the unspecified element in 1971 should turn out to be much smaller than in earlier censuses (when it was of the order of 3-5 per cent of the working force), then many of the results we have obtained might get upset. The sharp decline in other services in 1971 might be the result of the virtual elimination of the unspecified category in 1971, and the sharp rise in the shares of agricultural labour might indicate that many of the erstwhile unspecified have been returned as agricultural labourers in the 1971 Census. Alternatively, it is possible that many of the unspecified were reported as non-workers on the basis of their main activity in 1971; and this might explain the apparent and unexpected decline in participation rates for males in the working ages.||J.

India's trade with Sudan is regulated by trade agreements first entered into in 1965. The volume of trade both ways has been progressively increasing over the past seven years. However, recent developments have caused a stalemate in Indo-Sudanese trade relations. Experience with other bilateral trade agreements too, which were intended as aids to trade promotion, similarly indicates how there can be a sudden disruption of such trade leading to heavy losses. The issues that are raised in this context are: What are the major conditions for the success of trade agreements as durable bases for trade? What are their limitations if any? These problems are considered here against the background of Indo-Sudanese trade.||Priya Mutalik-Desai

The results are based on a random sample of 149 farming households of Hooghly district in West Bengal. They are presented separately for four size-classes, defined in terms of the acreage of cultivable area in each farm. The seasonal pattern of employment is very largely determined by the seasonality of the main crop of the region. Employment of all labour on farms and employment of family labour on farms as well as outside, mark four humps in the year - corresponding to the two sowing seasons and the two harvest seasons of the summer and winter paddy crops. These humps are clearly demarcated for the two smallest size-groups. The clarity is lost for the two higher groups, presumably because of the cropping pattern becoming more variegated.||Ashok Rudra,Ramdev Biswas

The first article (May 12) examined the scope of the Finance Commission under the Constitution and brought out that the Constitution gives the Commission the maximum freedom to operate in the areas under its purview. The present article reviews the approach of the five Finance Commissions, which have reported so far, to the question of resource-transfers between the Centre and the states. The principal conclusion that emerges from the review is that if the Finance Commissions have emerged as mere fillers of budgetary gaps for the states, little blame, if any, lies with the terms of reference of the Commissions. The blame lies, really and truly, with the Finance Commissions themselves. They simply abdicated their Constitutional obligations. If it wishes, the Sixth Finance Commission can, therefore, turn away from the gap-filling role and break new ground. The possibilities open to the Sixth Finance Commission will be examined in the next article.||

It adopts no particular pattern of growth, production, consumption or income distribution to constrain and channel the approach to the science and technology plan. One immediate result of this is that "the areas of prime importance" in the science and technology plan have not been derived from any explicit pattern of development of the country. Rather, one must work backwards and attempt to discover the type of India which will result from the successful implementation of the science and technology plan. Another result is that the numerous panels of the NSCT have not been given directive criteria regarding the choice of technologies; hence, the science and technology plan which emerges may well be at cross-purposes with the socio-economic plan - a result which is precisely what was hoped to be avoided by the setting up of the NCST. An alternative approach to the science and technology plan must begin by assessing the pattern of socio-economic change over the past 25 years and then decide what pattern of socio-economic growth should be preferred in the national interest. From this pattern of growth, criteria for the choice of technologies must be derived. It is the definition of these criteria which should constitute the essence of the alternative approach. For, the transmission of these criteria to the various NCST panels for mandatory use in the selection of science and technology tasks will ensure that the plan for science and technology will be directed towards the same objectives as the socio-economic plan. This paper seeks to suggest some lines along which such an alternative approach to the science and technology plan may be developed.||Amulya Kumar N. Reddy

31/3/1973- ||review of agriculture, march 1973||4362481||The Indian Agricultural Research System||The economic performance of the agricultural sector in most countries has been largely determined by the organised research and extension activity in those countries. An increasing number of studies have established an association between productivity growth (as conventionally measured) and the level of such activities. The term 'non-conventional' factors has crept into the related literature to describe these activities. At present, a complete compilation of the level of investment in agricultural research is not available either for all-India or for the major states in India. This paper develops such a compilation, in the form of time series data on research investment in each major state from 1950 to 1968. The primary purpose in developing these data is to provide a basis for studies of productivity gains in Indian agriculture. The authors realise that the enterprise is fraught with difficulties, as witness the notes to the tables. It has been possible, however, to obtain a reasonably complete reconciliation between two independent data sources - which has been the basis for reporting them here. The authors present this report in the hope that it will induce further studies which will provide more accurate data on these activities in the future.||Rakesh Mohan,D. Jha,Robert Evenson

The poor in this country have lately been lined up in all kinds of different ways and have been subjected to several sophisticated head-counts. Measurements of two related phenomena, viz, inequality and unemployment, have also received much attention recently. This note is concerned with tackling some conceptual issues thrown up by these measurement exercises. In particular, the object is: (i) to discuss briefly the relation between the concepts of poverty, inequality and unemployment; (ii) to review some recent analytical results on the welfare aspects of inequality measurement; (iii) to present an axiomatic framework for inequality measurement aiming to throw some light on measures like the Gini co-efficient; and (iv) to propose, in the light of (iii), an alternative measure of poverty, which is, in some important ways, superior to the measure used in the poverty debate.||Amartya Sen

17/3/1973- ||special article||4362434||Tax Incentives for Saving and Investment||In a situation where a large variety of inessential consumption articles are purveyed to the people with the help of high pressure selling and where possessors of black money every day set new styles in high living, the pressure to consume is almost irresistible. To counter this pressure, effective measures have to be devised to induce people to save and invest. However, under the existing system of tax incentives, the amount of tax benefit depends not so much on the volume of saving as on the level of the individual's taxable income. The result is that higher tax bounties are offered where the sacrifice involved in saving is almost nil or negligible. This perverse system should be replaced by one under which the rate and quantum of the tax benefit would depend on, and be directly linked to, the volume of savings generated in such a way that the larger the amount saved, the larger the tax benefit.||M.

Engineers must perceive the true nature of maintenance technology and whole-heartedly participate in it. Industrial management must recognise the true importance of the profession and create an environment that will attract talented engineers to it. Educational institutions must promote its development through the introduction of an integrated course of studies on Maintenance Engineering and also by encouraging the necessary research activity in the area. Even consulting engineers should find this a fertile field.||B. V. Chitnis

This article examines the level, fluctuation and trend of wage rates for agricultural workers in the whole of Kerala to see to what extent the phenomenon observed in the two IADP districts obtained in the other districts of the state. The two main findings that emerge from this study are, first, that the rise in the real wage rate in Kerala between 1960-61 and 1967-68 was far lower than indicated by earlier studies; and, second, that there were substantial variations between different villages in the long-term movement of real wage rates; in some the real wage rates had declined.||A.

The migrants remained villagers at heart and retained a close relationship with their village homes. For a long time, jute mill iabour was most unstable and floating in character, and the labour supply in jute mills was greatly affected by the seasons. The bad living and working conditions, the low wage rates, and the fluctuations in the international jute market and hence in employment, also contributed to this situation. This paper contains some results obtained through a sample survey of industrial workers in the greater Calcutta area during 1969-70. The information collected is presented with a view to finding out whether the traditional floating character of the workers in this old industry has undergone any change, and the extent to which the workers have settled down in greater Calcutta and have emerged as a distinct class of industrial proletariat without rural moorings.||N.

The most important fact is that the 14 banks have been allowed to operate in a manner far removed from the way in which strategic public-sector financial institutions should operate. Nationalisation through parliamentary law and the creation of a separate machinery in the government to supervise the banks have not brought about a substantial change in the field of commercial banking - either in the trends in operation or, more particularly, with regard to inter-bank competition. There is also the telling fact that there is no visible difference between the performance record of the nationalised banks and that of the largest among the non-nationalised banks.||Bhabatosh Datta
21/4/1973- ||special articles||4362559||Non-Brahmans and Communists in Bombay||This paper studies the radical working class movement which emerged in Bombay in the late 1920s and which brought together, in curious fashion, an emerging communist leadership with the leaders of the largely peasant-based non-Brahman movement. The ambiguities and outcome of these contacts and conflicts were decisive not only for the development of social radicalism but also for the direction of the nationalist movement in Maharashtra. While the focus of the paper is on the Bombay working class, the larger issue is the relationship of the 'cultural revolutionary non-Brahman movement with nationalism and communism. The purpose is to provide some additional insight into why the nationalist movement in India consolidated itself under a conservative leadership. Caste elitism, it is argued, was a major barrier to the spread of the Maharashtrian communist movement. Receptivity to a radical ideology existed among both urban and rural masses, but an anti-communist and conservative section of the non-Brahman elite was also there, ready to take advantage of any failure of the communists. These failures, along with the effectiveness of British repression, were decisive.||Gail Omvedt

The account of this estimation procedure provided in the Approach document requires clarification.||Elizabeth Krishna,Prasanta K. Pattanaik,K. Sundaram

The range of objectives implied in the overall management of inventories, therefore, needs to be compressed and relative priorities need to be assigned to the different specific objectives. To be effective at any point of time management of inventories should not be more than two to four objectives. This article seeks to illustrate the development of a set of objectives for inventory management by reference to specific enterprise situations.||A. P. Saxena

The economics of irrigation is an important, sophisticated and technical subject and, in attempting to tackle a subject outside its competence, the Commission has made a terrible mistake. It is imperative, therefore, that the Commission's chapters on the economics of irrigation be set aside and a commission of economists be appointed to determine the economic criteria for designing, selecting, running and financing irrigation projects.||Deepak Lal

A capitalist system, for example, has certain dynamic characteristics as well; we have to enquire into how the relations between agriculture and industry evolve over time, now and at what rate capital accumulation proceeds, and so on. This paper has tried to capture only one basic kind of imbalance which may be thrown up by several different evolutionary processes.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

The Giant Kosi Project has ushered in a new era of agricultural prosperity for this backward region. The benefits have, however, been shared unequally, the bulk of the gains accruing to substantial land owners. The Kosi tamed, in the absence of essential structural changes, has turned out to be an instrument of iniquity. The utter neglect of institutional reform has not only resulted in the widening of the disparities in wealth and income, but has also proved to be a formidable deterrent to the fuller utilisation of the irrigation potential. This paper gives an outline of some urgently needed institutional changes.||P. S. Appu

Women's Emancipation Movements in Europe and the US||If one studies the controversy between the socialist and the radical feminists, it becomes evident that only now, in the seventies, have women in the Western countries come back to the old burning problem which had preoccupied the women in the Old Left: How to link the struggle for the liberation of the working class with that for the emancipation of women. Fortunately, neither the socialist nor the radical feminists have as yet produced a complete theory. They rather go along with their movements, acting, theorising, and mobilising, at the same time. The radical feminists cannot ignore the fact that their movement is more or less middle-class oriented, like the whole students' movement so far. On the other hand, the socialist women cannot close their eyes to the systems of sexism and male chauvinism in the organisations of the New Left. This attitude shows that most of the men in the Left Movement have not yet understood the close connection between male dominance and patriarchalism in the family and capitalistic exploitation.||Maria Mies

22/9/1973- ||special articles||4363044||India, the USSR and the MiG Project||The MiG programme has not been a success. Since the MiG is inferior in performance to many of the Pakistan Air Force aircraft, its production in India would only be justified if it could be manufactured in large numbers. In fact production has not been on a large scale. Nor has it been successfully implemented: the aircraft is still more Russian- than Indian-made. And the plane is not cheap, not even in foreign exchange; the original terms, never over-generous, appear to have been subsequently tightened. India is as far as ever from ensuring that its military equipment is indigenously manufactured; the pace of development in the rest of the world has left it as far behind now as in 1962 - perhaps even further. One effect will be to reverse some of the decisions made by the Subramaniam committee, for the IAF will certainly require a substantial number of some more modern aircraft to maintain its position vis-a-vis Pakistan. Yet the MiG programme, and any 'advanced aircraft' successor to it, is unlikely to be abandoned; for although it has always been a white elephant, it has now become a sacred cow as well.||Dennis Childs,Michael Kidron
01/9/1973- ||special articles||4362986||Structure of Liner Shipping Freight Market in India: I: Organisation of Shipping Conferences||A shipping conference is an agreement among shipping companies operating liner services for the purpose of regulating and restraining competition. The need for a conference arises from the fact that the liner shipping market is characterised by an excess of tonnage. In such a situation unrestrained competition among shipping lines could lead to rate wars, to the detriment of the lines as well as shippers. This is the first of a series of three articles on the structure of the liner shipping freight market in India. It examines the organisation of shipping conferences, focusing attention on their methods of controlling competition, the salient feature of conference agreements and the decision-making process of the conferences.||Jeroo Kurus Coyaji

However, the debate on this issue has so far missed the basic fallacies. There is, no doubt, rampant inequity in appointment and promotion, but this is not so much due to 'irregularity' as to the fallacious rules. The most important of the latter is the system whereby recruitment and promotion are treated alike through a single process of advertisement-cum-selection. Herein lies the seed of all 'irregularities', inequities and mistrust.||K. R. Bhattacharya

17/11/1973- ||special articles||4363198||The Brezhnev Plan and the Indo-Soviet Treaty: Expectations and Frustrations||Almost immediately after the finalisation of the Indo-Soviet Treaty in August 1971, Moscow explicitly stated that this was only a step towards the realisation of an Asian security system, otherwise dubbed as the Brezhnev Plan. Soviet expectations of a larger security system evolving from the Indo-Soviet pact were unambiguous and serious. India, on the other hand, while not altogether indifferent to an extension of the pact, has not been fully committed to the concept of an Asian security system. Moscow has tried to sell the Brezhnev Plan to many Asian countries, but with little success. The Plan has come up against such counter-proposals as the Malaysian plan for the neutralisation of South-East Asia and the plan to keep the Indian Ocean free from the military presence of all the big powers. Considering these setbacks, it remains to be seen whether Moscow will pursue the Brezhnev Plan and if so, in what form.||R. V. R. Chandrasekhara Rao

In the present paper, which is a sequel to the earlier one, some further results are presented which go to strengthen the same negative conclusions. The data used in the earlier paper referred to four different states and many different periods, mostly back in the fifties. In the present paper more recent data (1970-71) are used, though these relate to a single area, the Hooghly district of West Bengal.||Harendranath Dwivedi,Ashok Rudra

The first article (May 12) examined the scope of the Finance Commission under the Constitution and brought out that the Constitution gives the Commissions the maximum freedom to operate in the areas under their purview. The second article (June 23) reviewed the approach of the Finance Commissions which have reported so far to the question of resource-transfers between the Centre and the states and dealt with their gap-filling approach. The present article seeks to offer some ideas about how the Sixth Finance Commission may make a departure from the gap-filling approach to Centre-state relations.||

At the same time, British colonial rule, characterised by negative paternalism, deprived the indigenous Fijian people of the fruits of their most valuable asset, land. The stage was set for a divided economy and society. In politics, the division into a two-party system emerged auickly after the development of representative government through the controversial 1965 Constitution. The Alliance, comprising the Fijian Association, the Fiji Indian Alliance, and the General Electors Association, has constituted the Government. Its support comes overwhelmingly from the Fijians and the General Electors, and to a lesser but nevertheless significant degree from the Indians. The National Federation Party in the opposition relies almost totally on Indian support, though in the 1972 election it was able to convert this into victory for three of its Fijian candidates. At present, all the political leaders are determined that racial strife must be avoided at all costs. Nonetheless, the Indians of Fiji are not without anxiety about the future.||Ahmed Ali
