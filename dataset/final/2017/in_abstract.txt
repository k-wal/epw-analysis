Based on an ethnographic study of information and communication technologies in two villages of Rajasthan, the paper aims to situate social and digital media in the complex rural society and media ecology using co-constructivist approaches. Focusing on context-sensitive meaning-making of icts, the paper seeks to contribute to an empirically sound discourse on media, technology and rural society in India.||Sandeep Mertia

Can a model borrowed from developed countries work in the absence of sufficient demand, a conducive environment, and supporting infrastructure such as good road networks, bicycle lanes and regulated traffic?||Jayashree Dubey,Rajesh Dubey
17-11-2017||perspectives||---------||Ethnic Environmentalism in the Eastern Himalaya||The Sikkim–Darjeeling Himalaya is undergoing serious environmental changes as a result of the rampant construction of hydroelectric projects and climate-induced changes. Their impact is most discernible on the economically and politically vulnerable mountain communities. The silence in the public sphere around environmental issues reflects the scalar distribution of political power, the limitations of existing grievance-sharing mechanisms, and the predominance of ethnicity as a key variable in negotiations around the environment.||Mona Chettri
27-10-2017||-------||---------||Can Celebrating Himalaya Diwas Save the Himalayan Ecology?||Since 2015, 9 September has been officially observed as Himalay Diwas or Himalaya Day in Uttarakhand. Some important considerations emerge from this. First, what is the potential of Himalay Diwas in highlighting the environmental issues faced by the region? Second, when research has shown that the past environmental movements (in the state) have actually been misrepresented and have created environmental injustices for the local populations (Bandyopadhyay 1999; Rangan 2000), to what extent does Himalay Diwas address these local voices? Finally, does the day receive attention from and appeal to the masses? The article intends to explore the conception of the Himalayas and the environment evident in the case of the Himalay Diwas celebrations. [1]||Neha Pande

29-09-2017||discussion||---------||Responsible Fisheries? : A Response to the ‘New Path’ of Co-governance||The article “Responsible Fisheries: Kerala Fish Workers Open New Path in Co-governance” (EPW, 29 August 2015) argued that the “Kochi Initiative” in Kerala—a collaboration between fishers and government scientists—was a major breakthrough in fisheries governance. We suggest that these authors cheered too soon. Through evidence from coastal Tamil Nadu, we note the history of the debate among fishers on environmental and justice impacts of new technology. Fisher management skills are usually ignored by state agencies which also fail to govern effectively. While co-management is the way to go, it requires more state effort.||Maarten Bavinck,Fenna Imara Hoefsloot,Max Wastiaux
22-09-2017||special articles||---------||Compensatory Afforestation||Compensatory afforestation is a dubious and controversial environmental “offset” that is adding to environmental damage instead of mitigating or compensating it. Compensatory afforestation may actually be accelerating the invasion of India’s forests by big corporations, in collusion with a permissive state, by legitimising the destruction of forests, greenwashing the land grabs, and encroaching on common property resources and community-held lands. This article is based on a study of the Polavaram multipurpose project in Andhra Pradesh, the Durgapur mines in Maharashtra, the Teesta hydroelectric project in Sikkim and the Lower Subansiri hydroelectric project in Arunachal Pradesh.||Soumitra Ghosh
14-09-2017||das kapital, vol 1—150 years||---------||A Marxist Approach to Understanding Ecology||Two seminal books, John Bellamy Foster, Brett Clark, and Richard York’s The Ecological Rift: Capitalism’s War on the Earth and John Bellamy Foster’s The Ecological Revolution: Making Peace with the Planet suggest that the rift between humanity and nature must be analysed in its intertwining with other kinds of alienation, all stemming from the adverse effects of the very nature and structure of capitalist society. Nothing short of an eco-social revolution is required to deal with the social and ecological crisis.||Karen Haydock

Using a river-based sport, if a multi-nation rowing league is created, the media, corporate and government attention could create an economic system that will help give an impetus to river cleaning and maintenance, where nothing significant has been achieved in spite of institutions like the World Bank pouring in billions of dollars.||Ashish Karnavat
24-08-2017||special articles||---------||The Western Ghats Imbroglio in Kerala : A Political Economy Perspective||The bitter opposition in Kerala to the Gadgil and Kasturirangan reports on the conservation of the Western Ghats was a result of information asymmetries, engendered by ignorance of the reports’ contents, attendant disinformation campaigns and rumour-mongering abetted by and favouring the Church, ruling and opposition political parties, and other interest groups to mislead settler–farmers and create a panic situation. The exclusive focus on “ecologically sensitive areas” and efforts to exclude certain areas from it failed to address the larger debate on sustainable development.||Nisha Velappan Nair,John Stephen Moolakkattu
03-08-2017||review of environment and development||---------||Governance of Waste||Well-versed in the production of waste, corporate capital has not generally focused on capitalising on waste. The discards of consumption, previously approached broadly as mere waste, have recently found rebirth in an increasingly corporate waste market in India. Ranging from contracts for waste collection and incineration-plant installation to sales of recyclables, formal businesses are entering the business of revaluing waste, often to the detriment of India’s already existing informal waste sector that has long conducted its own waste-based businesses. This new, increasingly corporate, business of waste is intimately connected to a new waste governance regime in India. Concerns regarding two symbolically significant waste streams, municipal solid waste and electronic waste, illuminate waste beyond its “management,” and demonstrate its embeddedness in matters of consumerism, informal-sector livelihoods, and urban ecology.||Vinay Gidwani,Julia Corwin
02-08-2017||review of environment and development||---------||The Industrial Project and Organised Labour||This paper looks at the responses of organised labour to the “development” project exemplified by the steel plant, the big dam and the power plant. More precisely, it analyses the presence (or not) of an ecological critique in trade union/labour responses to industrial projects. The paper explores theoretical connections between class-based politics and ecological questions. It delineates some of the specific processes and conditions which can facilitate the entry of ecological issues into the imaginations of a trade union, using the experiences of the Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha in central India in the process. It argues that “class consciousness” is hardly a deterrent for an engagement with ecology, if one adequately understands the definitions of “class,” labour and production. In India’s specific context, the coming together of the concerns and imaginations of the industrial worker and the Adivasi peasant/farmer can facilitate this conversation between “red” and “green” imaginations.||Radhika Krishnan
02-08-2017||review of environment and development||---------||The Forest Rights Act : Political Economy of ‘Environmental’ Questions||The Forest Rights Act represented a historic step forward for forest management in India, and it is often hailed as such. However, it did not emerge from struggles for the control over forests alone, but was a product of an ongoing intersection between political conflict, features of Indian capitalism, and the conceptions of “environment” and “development” in India’s political discourse. In that sense, it is not only an “environmental” legislation, but an economic and social one, and one that belongs to a particular political conjuncture, representing both its limitations, and more importantly, its liberatory possibilities. This paper looks at the FRA in this context and explores how it grew out of this kind of politics, being marked both by the constraints of this period, and by the spaces it created for genuinely new conceptions and processes of development.||Shankar Gopalakrishnan
28-07-2017||commentary||---------||Rivers as Legal Persons : A Regressive Step||The recent decision by the Uttarakhand High Court to declare the Ganga and Yamuna rivers as “juristic persons” is skewed and based on flawed legal reasoning. The judgment threatens to undermine years of progress made in environmental jurisprudence and fails to serve the purposes of environmental conservation and sustainable use of river water.||Bushra Quasmi
30-06-2017||commentary||---------||Notes from the Other Side of a Forest Fire||Although widely used as a tool in forest management across the world, causing fires is illegal in Indian forests. This article points out that the present understanding of fire as essentially disruptive has its antecedents in a colonial perspective that came from seeing the forest primarily as a source of timber. However, the practices of indigenous communities as well as the insights of ecological studies point to the importance of using fire in controlled ways to manage dry and deciduous forest ecosystems.||Tarsh Thekaekara,Abi Tamim Vanak,Ankila J Hiremath,Nitin D Rai,Jayashree Ratnam,Raman Sukumar
30-06-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||India and Africa in the Global Agricultural System (1961–2050) : Towards a New Sociotechnical Regime?||The asynchronous but somewhat similar agricultural trajectories of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, especially India, are analysed over nearly a century (1961–2050). Millions of pieces of data available on the past (1961–2007) and on a plausible future (2006–50 projections by the Food and Agriculture Organization) are organised in a simple world food model where production, trade and consumption are aggregated and balanced in calories. Given the current and/or future land–labour relationships that characterise India and Africa, can these regions experience the same structural transformation that the developed countries went through, or work together towards a new sociotechnical regime by developing their own regionally differentiated labour-intensive production investments and technological capacities for economic, social, and ecological sustainability?||Bruno Dorin

What is the procedure to divert forestlands? What will be the consequences on communities dependent on the forest? Have other cities in India been built on forestland? What is the ecological value of the forestlands in question?||
05-05-2017||commentary||---------||Why New Delhi Must Withdraw from the Rampal Power Plants||The joint decision of Indian and Bangladeshi governments to build coal-fired thermal power plants in Rampal upzila close to the ecologically rich and sensitive Sundarbans will undo whatever gains that may have been made in the bilateral relations between the two nations under the Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League government.||Manoj Misra,Sourayan Mookerjea
27-04-2017||special articles||---------||Why Urban Waste Continues to Follow the Path of Least Resistance||A lack of imagination and linear municipal solid waste management practices have resulted in promoting incineration, which is fraught with adverse environmental and health consequences, as a solution to getting rid of our urban garbage. This paper points out that while enhancing the abilities of cities to work towards zero waste ought to be the goal, local populations now bear the unhealthy effects of unsound waste management processes, and local governments bear their operational and financial burden, all to no good effect.||Gopal Krishna

Over the past two decades, there have been two such episodes when the banking sector was severely impaired by balance sheet problems. A comparative analysis of two banking crisis episodes— one in the late 1990s, and another that started in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and is yet to be resolved—is presented. Taking note of the macroeconomic and banking environment preceding these episodes, and the degree and nature of crises, policy responses undertaken are discussed. Policy lessons are explored with suggestions for measures to adapt to a future balance sheet-related crisis in the banking sector such that the impact on the real economy is minimal.||Rajeswari Sengupta,Harsh vardhan

Unfortunately, public resources like the river water are sold at throwaway prices to corporations, who in turn resell the water either in the form of packaged drinking water or as aerated beverages. The political economy of the river and the state’s industrial plans, require radical rethinking.||

The “encroachments” of the poor are delegitimised and they become victims of eviction drives while encroachments by the state and the middle- and high-income classes on ecologically vulnerable areas are legitimised. In Guwahati, this has led to a cycle of violence and counter-violence. This paper sets this sequence of events against the historically contested land rights issue in a city with limited habitable land due to its natural ecology.||Darshini Mahadevia,Aseem Mishra,Yogi Joseph
03-02-2017||commentary||---------||Intergenerational Equity Case Study : Iron-ore Mining in Goa||The public trust doctrine makes natural resources a part of the commons, owned equally by all, and legally owned by the state. The resources and opportunities that the present generation have inherited must be available to future generations in perpetuity. In the Goa mining case, the Supreme Court wanted to implement intergenerational equity on the grounds of the exhaustion of the iron-ore reserves as well as the widespread damage to the Goan environment and social fabric.||Rahul Basu
27-01-2017||commentary||---------||A Clerk Who Saw the Genius in the Ordinary : Anupam Mishra (1947–2016)||Anupam Mishra’s personal qualities characterised his work. There are others who researched and wrote about traditional water management in India with great depth and commitment. Mishra, however, saw himself as the voice of his people, his society. He did not see with the eyes of academic objectivity or impartial commentary, but with empathy and imagination. He noticed the environmental wisdom in the ways of ordinary people and appreciated the cultural threads and values that carried that wisdom from generation to illiterate generation.||Sopan Joshi
