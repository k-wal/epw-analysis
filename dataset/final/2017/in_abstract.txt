29-12-2017||commentary||---------||Putting a Price on Tiger Reserves : Creating Conservation Value or Green Grabbing?||The attempts by economists in India to estimate the economic value of tiger reserves must be seen in a context in which inviolate tiger reserves have imposed enormous social costs on local people. There is relative silence around the question of why one should value tiger reserves when they are already protected and who might benefit from such valuations. We call on scholars and activists working in conservation and development to question valuation approaches, given their problematic outcomes.||Ajit Menon,Nitin D Rai
29-12-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||Rural Construction Employment Boom during 2000–12 : Evidence from NSSO Surveys||Amid (near) jobless economic growth during 2000–12, construction employment boomed at over 9% annually. It was part of a 10 percentage point rise in fixed capital formation rate in 13 years, to 35% of gross domestic product. The boom was rural, growing 2.5 times (at over 12%) as fast as in urban areas (at a mere 5%). National Sample Survey Office primary data reveals that a rise in rural private residential construction is the principal factor explaining the boom. This suggests improvements in rural housing status: conversion of kutcha houses into pucca houses. Decline in price-to-income ratio—of cement to rural wages—expanded rural construction demand. The popular perception (or explanation) for the rural construction employment boom in terms of rural–urban migration—of short-term, circular or seasonal—does not hold water.||Kanika Mahajan,R Nagaraj
29-12-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||It Is Not Just about Fences : Dynamics of Human–Wildlife Conflict in Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand||Discussions on human–wildlife conflict in India typically take place within a narrow frame, viewing the problem as a result of human “encroachment” into wildlife territories, and hence, one that primarily needs to be addressed by “compensating,” relocating or “protecting” local communities. Most research focuses on protected areas and severely underestimates the scale of the problem. This study, based on field surveys in Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand, throws up a different picture, where conflict is a major problem, but one to which structures and practices of forest management in the country are a central contributor. It also points to how more democratic and rights-respecting approaches to forest management must be an essential part of any solution.||Shankar Gopalakrishnan,Terpan Singh Chauhan,M S Selvaraj

The strategy must allow for dialogue by rebuilding trust and should look at arbitration and negotiation as methods of conflict resolution. It is necessary to evolve a strategy that optimises the rational usage of Mahanadi water to benefit people from both Chhattisgarh and Odisha, coupled with the implementation of a multi-stakeholder forum that finds peaceful solutions and minimises areas of contention in a negotiable and consensual manner.||Keshab Chandra Ratha,Sushanta Kumar Mahapatra

Where all such hate crime shared on social media, especially lynchings, builds an ever-present sense of fear for the Muslim, this video does away with all padding, any semblance of rationale, the use of passion as motivator, and mob as executive. This is a radical break from the past where the Hindu right felt a need to justify itself even to the rest of the country.||Maaz bin Bilal

However, the movement to save Hasdeo Arand forests used these legislative provisions as an advocacy tool to not only highlight the regional challenges but also strive for a greater role of gram sabhas in central- and state-level policy legislating processes. It showcases the potential, as well as limits, of harnessing local self-governance institutions to push the boundaries of the provisions of these acts.||Priyanshu Gupta,Arnab Roy-Chowdhury
01-12-2017||special articles||---------||Viewing National Water Policies through a Gendered Lens||Despite the international recognition accorded to the key role played by women in issues around water, the extent to which India’s national water policies accommodate gender concerns remains to be examined. Based on an in-depth content analysis of the three nwps—of 1987, 2002, and 2012—this paper argues that incorporation of women in the planning, provisioning, and management of water resources continues to be disregarded. Women’s concerns in the water sector are articulated around their domestic roles and subsumed under notions of “household” and “social equity.” The larger questions of water rights of women, both in terms of access and control over decision-making, remain unaddressed.||Tanusree Paul

This petroleum-related foreign direct investment and trade can be mutually beneficial in the short term, providing African exporters with a foreign market and helping India meet its energy needs. Such deals may become less effective economically over the medium and long term, however, given the increasing availability and cost-competitiveness of renewable energies, an array of restrictions and taxes on carbon emissions, and diminishing returns in the ratio of energy production to energy output.||Rick Rowden

Some important considerations emerge from this. First, what is the potential of Himalay Diwas in highlighting the environmental issues faced by the region? Second, when research has shown that the past environmental movements (in the state) have actually been misrepresented and have created environmental injustices for the local populations (Bandyopadhyay 1999; Rangan 2000), to what extent does Himalay Diwas address these local voices? Finally, does the day receive attention from and appeal to the masses? The article intends to explore the conception of the Himalayas and the environment evident in the case of the Himalay Diwas celebrations. [1]||Neha Pande

The victory celebrations of the local communities, however, have been muted because their struggle against corporate greed, and the destruction of land and habitats has left them with over 2,000 warrants for arrest, 400 police cases, lives lost, livelihoods disrupted, communities fractured, and the constant memory of violence and repression.||Ranjana Padhi,Nigam
12-10-2017||special articles||---------||Livelihoods, Conservation and the Forest Rights Act in a National Park : A Conundrum||National parks have been instituted in India to take care of ecosystems rich in biodiversity, and to protect them from human intervention. This has led to many conflicts between the local communities and the state. To address these issues, the state has enacted laws such as the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act in favour of local communities. However, the purpose of national parks and the FRA seems to be in contradiction. We analyse existing acts and regulations being implemented by the state in Bhitarkanika National Park in Odisha and try to understand their relevance when compared with the ground reality, based on our villagelevel investigations in the Bhitarkanika ecosystem.||Subhashree Banerjee,Syed Ajmal Pasha

A review of the emerging literature and descriptive evidence from a district-level data set on Maoist conflict indicates that the relationship between underdevelopment andMaoist activity cannot be explained in simple economic terms. At the state level, Maoistconflict-affected states have similar growth trends and do not score lower on development measures. In a cross section of districts, the most robust predictor of Maoist activity is forest cover, which could reflect the importance of strategic terrain factors as well as the relevance of forest rights and forest produce.||Maitreesh Ghatak,Oliver Vanden Eynde

We suggest that these authors cheered too soon. Through evidence from coastal Tamil Nadu, we note the history of the debate among fishers on environmental and justice impacts of new technology. Fisher management skills are usually ignored by state agencies which also fail to govern effectively. While co-management is the way to go, it requires more state effort.||Maarten Bavinck,Fenna Imara Hoefsloot,Max Wastiaux

22-09-2017||special articles||---------||Compensatory Afforestation||Compensatory afforestation is a dubious and controversial environmental “offset” that is adding to environmental damage instead of mitigating or compensating it. Compensatory afforestation may actually be accelerating the invasion of India’s forests by big corporations, in collusion with a permissive state, by legitimising the destruction of forests, greenwashing the land grabs, and encroaching on common property resources and community-held lands. This article is based on a study of the Polavaram multipurpose project in Andhra Pradesh, the Durgapur mines in Maharashtra, the Teesta hydroelectric project in Sikkim and the Lower Subansiri hydroelectric project in Arunachal Pradesh.||Soumitra Ghosh

03-08-2017||review of environment and development||---------||Governance of Waste||Well-versed in the production of waste, corporate capital has not generally focused on capitalising on waste. The discards of consumption, previously approached broadly as mere waste, have recently found rebirth in an increasingly corporate waste market in India. Ranging from contracts for waste collection and incineration-plant installation to sales of recyclables, formal businesses are entering the business of revaluing waste, often to the detriment of India’s already existing informal waste sector that has long conducted its own waste-based businesses. This new, increasingly corporate, business of waste is intimately connected to a new waste governance regime in India. Concerns regarding two symbolically significant waste streams, municipal solid waste and electronic waste, illuminate waste beyond its “management,” and demonstrate its embeddedness in matters of consumerism, informal-sector livelihoods, and urban ecology.||Vinay Gidwani,Julia Corwin
02-08-2017||review of environment and development||---------||The Industrial Project and Organised Labour||This paper looks at the responses of organised labour to the “development” project exemplified by the steel plant, the big dam and the power plant. More precisely, it analyses the presence (or not) of an ecological critique in trade union/labour responses to industrial projects. The paper explores theoretical connections between class-based politics and ecological questions. It delineates some of the specific processes and conditions which can facilitate the entry of ecological issues into the imaginations of a trade union, using the experiences of the Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha in central India in the process. It argues that “class consciousness” is hardly a deterrent for an engagement with ecology, if one adequately understands the definitions of “class,” labour and production. In India’s specific context, the coming together of the concerns and imaginations of the industrial worker and the Adivasi peasant/farmer can facilitate this conversation between “red” and “green” imaginations.||Radhika Krishnan
02-08-2017||review of environment and development||---------||The Forest Rights Act : Political Economy of ‘Environmental’ Questions||The Forest Rights Act represented a historic step forward for forest management in India, and it is often hailed as such. However, it did not emerge from struggles for the control over forests alone, but was a product of an ongoing intersection between political conflict, features of Indian capitalism, and the conceptions of “environment” and “development” in India’s political discourse. In that sense, it is not only an “environmental” legislation, but an economic and social one, and one that belongs to a particular political conjuncture, representing both its limitations, and more importantly, its liberatory possibilities. This paper looks at the FRA in this context and explores how it grew out of this kind of politics, being marked both by the constraints of this period, and by the spaces it created for genuinely new conceptions and processes of development.||Shankar Gopalakrishnan
02-08-2017||review of environment and development||---------||The Task of the Climate Translator||Climate translations or stories must move between different registers to imaginatively engage with and express life in the Anthropocene. They must give visible form to the diverse climate imaginaries that proliferate in the world. These stories, however, remain unexamined. Following Walter Benjamin, translation is here conceptualised as a movement across domains wherein the translated version need not literally adhere to the original, but should rather aim to carry its echo. An instance of the form potential climate translations might assume is provided through an ethnographic account of human–animal relations in the Indian Himalaya. It compares and contrasts mainstream scientific accounts of animal endangerment/extinction and conflict to embedded but distinct Himalayan stories of multispecies relationality. These seemingly different accounts share a recognisably similar consciousness of human impact, inter-species entanglements, and climatic change.||Nayanika Mathur
04-08-2017||special articles||---------||From Groundwater Regulation to Integrated Water Management : The Biophysical Case||Groundwater over-exploitation poses a severe threat to food, water and livelihood security in India, but the approach to groundwater regulation has been guided by the simplistic prescription that to achieve sustainable use, pumping must be less than recharge. This article explains the hydrological cycle and the close relationship between groundwater and surface water, and argues that the conventional notion of sustainable groundwater use is fundamentally flawed. Groundwater, soil moisture and surface water are part of a single integrated resource, and cannot be regulated independent of each other. The solution is not sustainable use or the compartmentalisation of surface and groundwater but the fair and transparent reallocation of renewable freshwater resources.||Veena Srinivasan,Sharachchandra Lele

21-07-2017||special articles||---------||Community-based Natural Resource Management in the Sundarbans : Implications of Customary Rights, Law and Practices||There has been widespread assertion of the fact that traditional state laws on protected area conservation can pose a threat to the customary collective rights of local communities inhabiting these areas, inducing livelihood vulnerabilities. Within contemporary academic discourse, thus, there remains a major question concerning the issue of institutionalising the non-marketable customary collective rights of local communities to address the asymmetrical power relationships in natural resource distribution conflicts. Against this backdrop, a study conducted in the Sundarban forest region of West Bengal explores the community-based natural resource management paradigm and how customary rights of the local communities have fared under the joint forest management programme. It examines the applicability, as well as the successes and limitations of the programme as an alternative to state-led top-down models of conservation, and the impact of political and economic control over people and resources.||Amrita Sen,Sarmistha Pattanaik

Merely understanding climate science, or dealing with it through the frame of technology is clearly insufficient. Religious engagement with climate change is both necessary and inevitable. But there is much to discover about how religious beliefs, institutions and practices around the world engage with the idea of climate change, and to what effect, thereby offering rich research agendas with which religious scholars and others might profitably engage.||Mike Hulme

13-07-2017||special articles||---------||Primitive Accumulations at the Margins : Commodification of Land and Labour in Chhattisgarh||The processes of primitive accumulation have always been conjoined with capitalist relations of production and accumulation even in their advanced stages. These are quite critical in understanding the theoretical underpinnings of the process through which mining activities tend to completely transform the landscape of Chhattisgarh. By using Karl Polanyi’s thesis of double movement and the theory of primitive accumulation by Karl Marx, this study delves into contemporary processes of grabbing land and forced displacements in Chhattisgarh. Commodification of land has affected not only the livelihoods of local communities in Chhattisgarh, but has also disrupted sociocultural harmony. Our study elaborates on the cultural vacuum—to use Polanyi’s term—that is created once an individual is displaced from her/his social settings and traditional institutions.||Kamei Aphun,Jay Prakash Sharma

This article points out that the present understanding of fire as essentially disruptive has its antecedents in a colonial perspective that came from seeing the forest primarily as a source of timber. However, the practices of indigenous communities as well as the insights of ecological studies point to the importance of using fire in controlled ways to manage dry and deciduous forest ecosystems.||Tarsh Thekaekara,Abi Tamim Vanak,Ankila J Hiremath,Nitin D Rai,Jayashree Ratnam,Raman Sukumar

Power subsidies have grown these markets and made them pro-poor, but are also responsible for groundwater depletion, and for financial troubles of electricity distribution companies of India or DISCOMs. Gujarat has successfully reduced subsidies by rationing farm power supply, and West Bengal has done so by charging farmers commercial power tariff on metered consumption. Subsidy reforms have hit poor farmers and tenants hard in both the states. Gujarat has tried to support the poor, with some success, by prioritising them in allocating new tube well connections. We argue that West Bengal too can support its poor by tweaking its farm power pricing formula to turn a sellers’ water market into a buyers’ one.||Tushaar Shah,Sujata Das Chowdhury
30-06-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||India and Africa in the Global Agricultural System (1961–2050) : Towards a New Sociotechnical Regime?||The asynchronous but somewhat similar agricultural trajectories of sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, especially India, are analysed over nearly a century (1961–2050). Millions of pieces of data available on the past (1961–2007) and on a plausible future (2006–50 projections by the Food and Agriculture Organization) are organised in a simple world food model where production, trade and consumption are aggregated and balanced in calories. Given the current and/or future land–labour relationships that characterise India and Africa, can these regions experience the same structural transformation that the developed countries went through, or work together towards a new sociotechnical regime by developing their own regionally differentiated labour-intensive production investments and technological capacities for economic, social, and ecological sustainability?||Bruno Dorin

It also goes against long-agreed climate principles, and is blind to emergent clean energy trends. In practical terms, the US had activated a rollback of mitigation policies and contributions to climate finance prior to this announcement. Until there are changes in domestic US climate politics—of which there are positive signs—the US cannot be regarded a reliable partner for global climate cooperation.||Navroz K Dubash

Information collected from medium, small and marginal farmers in eastern Uttar Pradesh is compared with climatic and agricultural data. The results reveal that farmers are aware of long-term changes in the weather pattern and change their practices to deal with socio-economic changes. Yet, most of them do not see these changes as constituting what academics refer to as “climate change.”||Amarnath Tripathi,Ashok K Mishra

A careful reading of this largely public relations spin on existing plans suggests that it chiefly hopes to persuade the Nuclear Suppliers Group to accept India as a member and attract capital that aims to profit from supplying components for nuclear power plants. Given our track record, the prospects of it adding to the role of nuclear power in India appear bleak.||

The focus is on how communist ideology for a casteless and classless society translated into the humaneness of revolutionary subjectivity, creating relations of intimacy between the guerrilla armies and the people in its strongholds. Crucially, also analysed are a series of contradictions that constantly undermine revolutionary mobilisation, tearing the Naxalites apart and destroying them from within.||Alpa Shah

The processes examined include regulations related to coal-fired thermal power plants and water. The Indian process is ad hoc, opaque, and has limited scope for public participation. This can lead to inappropriate standards, lack of legitimacy of standards, and absence of widespread acceptance, all leading to ineffective implementation. The paper discusses these critical deficiencies and suggests improvements.||Shripad Dharmadhikary

Over the past two decades, there have been two such episodes when the banking sector was severely impaired by balance sheet problems. A comparative analysis of two banking crisis episodes— one in the late 1990s, and another that started in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and is yet to be resolved—is presented. Taking note of the macroeconomic and banking environment preceding these episodes, and the degree and nature of crises, policy responses undertaken are discussed. Policy lessons are explored with suggestions for measures to adapt to a future balance sheet-related crisis in the banking sector such that the impact on the real economy is minimal.||Rajeswari Sengupta,Harsh vardhan

This is done by tracing the dynamics of urban planning and governance that have produced two interlinked types of infrastructural violence in the locality—municipal water denial and violent articulations of infrastructure by informal water providers—and the experiences of everyday conflict and violence that emerge in residents’ lives as a consequence. How conflicts and violence shape residents’ attempts to negotiate and attain better water access are also discussed.||Renu Desai,Shachi Sanghvi

The “encroachments” of the poor are delegitimised and they become victims of eviction drives while encroachments by the state and the middle- and high-income classes on ecologically vulnerable areas are legitimised. In Guwahati, this has led to a cycle of violence and counter-violence. This paper sets this sequence of events against the historically contested land rights issue in a city with limited habitable land due to its natural ecology.||Darshini Mahadevia,Aseem Mishra,Yogi Joseph

Farmers, especially smallholder farmers, need advance warning of emergent weather conditions at a local level. Mobile telecommunication systems are increasingly cost-effective and an efficient way of delivering weather-based agro-advisories to farmers at a large scale. Agrometeorological services facilitate flexible, weather-based agriculture planning and help build evidence and capacities of communities, technical and developmental agencies to plan and implement climate-adaptive responses. The relevance and innovativeness of multi-institutional collaboration lies in the institutional, technical and pedagogical strategy adopted which offers important lessons on how agrometeorological services can be organised to make smallholder farming climate-resilient on a larger scale.||Crispino Lobo,N Chattopadhyay,K V Rao

In practice, government programmes in rural India have paid little attention in understanding why so many rural Indians defecate in the open rather than use affordable pit latrines. Drawing on new data, a study points out that widespread open defecation in rural India is on account of beliefs, values, and norms about purity, pollution, caste, and untouchability that cause people to reject affordable latrines. Future rural sanitation programmes must address villagers’ ideas about pollution, pit-emptying, and untouchability, and should do so in ways that accelerate progress towards social equality for Dalits rather than delay it.||Diane Coffey,Aashish Gupta,Payal Hathi,Dean Spears,Nikhil Srivastav,Sangita Vyas
