The question that remains unanswered: what has dissuaded the ministry from filing this review petition even though more than five months have gone by?” This is the corrected version of the article. The corporate conglomerate headed by Gautam Adani has been accused by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence of having allegedly evaded taxes and laundered money to the tune of around ₹1,000 crore while trading in cut and polished diamonds and gold jewellery. The DRI has claimed that companies in the Adani Group misused export incentives and indulged in high-velocity circular trading through a complex web of front companies located in different parts of the world. The government seems strangely reticent about filing a review petition in the Supreme Court that could protect its revenue interests.||

29-12-2017||commentary||---------||Multilevel Failure of WTO Ministerial at Buenos Aires||The World Trade Organization’s 11th Ministerial Conference at Buenos Aires witnessed multiple failures on all fronts. The United States blocked the only mandated outcome on the permanent solution for public stockholding programmes for food security at the meeting, a priority issue for India and other developing countries. But the chair of the meeting and the WTO director general claimed gains from controversial new plurilateral initiatives announced by groups of countries that seek to wipe out the unfulfilled Doha multilateral trade negotiations.||D Ravi Kanth

However, the commitment to agree to a permanent solution by the 11th Ministerial Conference did not materialise. The United States and some other members reneged on their commitment to finding a permanent solution, effectively undermining the WTO itself. Developing country members have to persist for a permanent solution.||Sachin Kumar Sharma,Abhijit Das

29-12-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||Insights on Demonetisation from Rural Tamil Nadu : Understanding Social Networks and Social Protection||Drawing on survey data from rural Tamil Nadu, the effects of demonetisation are documented. Serious concerns arise with regard to the achievement of its stated goals. The rural economy was adversely affected in terms of employment, daily financial practices, and social network use for over three months. People came to rely more strongly on their networks to sustain their economic and social activities. Demonetisation has probably further marginalised those without support networks. In a context such as India, where state social protection is weak and governmental schemes are notoriously subject to patronage and clientelistic networks, dense networks of supportive relatives, friends and patrons remain key for safeguarding daily life. With cashless policies gaining currency in various parts of the world, we believe our findings have major implications, seriously questioning their merit, especially among the most marginalised segments of the population.||Isabelle Guérin,Youna Lanos,Sébastien Michiels,Christophe Jalil Nordman,Govindan Venkatasubramanian
29-12-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||Rural Construction Employment Boom during 2000–12 : Evidence from NSSO Surveys||Amid (near) jobless economic growth during 2000–12, construction employment boomed at over 9% annually. It was part of a 10 percentage point rise in fixed capital formation rate in 13 years, to 35% of gross domestic product. The boom was rural, growing 2.5 times (at over 12%) as fast as in urban areas (at a mere 5%). National Sample Survey Office primary data reveals that a rise in rural private residential construction is the principal factor explaining the boom. This suggests improvements in rural housing status: conversion of kutcha houses into pucca houses. Decline in price-to-income ratio—of cement to rural wages—expanded rural construction demand. The popular perception (or explanation) for the rural construction employment boom in terms of rural–urban migration—of short-term, circular or seasonal—does not hold water.||Kanika Mahajan,R Nagaraj
29-12-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||Changes in Rural Economy of India, 1971 to 2012 : Lessons for Job-led Growth||The transition in the rural economy in the last four decades is examined based on the analysis of growth and composition of output and employment. A reduction in the share of agriculture, and a dominance of non-farm activities in the rural economy is noted from 2004–05 onwards. However, agriculture continues to be the predominant source of employment. Employment in the construction sector increased substantially, but was not large enough to absorb workers leaving agriculture, resulting in a decline in rural employment after 2004–05. A serious imbalance has emerged in output and employment in different sectors in rural areas requiring urgent attention to create jobs in manufacturing, services, and construction. Creation of jobs in rural areas requires a complete rethink of rural industrialisation.||Ramesh Chand,S K Srivastava,Jaspal Singh

It is revealed that farmers accessing either public or private extension services devote larger proportion of cropped area to cultivation of horticultural crops relative to farmers who do not access any type of extension services. Public extension service has been found to be marginally more effective than private extension service in this regard. Further, only public extension service is found to have a significant impact on income generation. It is suggested that outreach of the public extension services should be improved.||Binoy Goswami,Ranjan Jyoti Bezbaruah

The National Rural Livelihoods Mission, which aims to reduce rural poverty by organising women into self-help groups, building capacity and providing access to microcredit is evaluated through a survey of 2,615 households in five districts of Madhya Pradesh. The focus is on four key questions. Who benefits and who gets left out? What is the pattern of household investment priorities? Is sustainable asset accumulation happening? What should be the exit strategy? It is found that the NRLM benefited the poor, while the very poor are struggling to repay the loans and getting left behind in poverty.||Sandeep Tambe,Suprava Patnaik,Jigyasa Bisaria,Amitabh Pandey,Ujjal kumar Sarma,G Ananda Vadivelu
29-12-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||Agriculture Insurance in India : Promise, Pitfalls, and the Way Forward||The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (during kharif 2016) and Weather-based Crop Insurance Scheme (kharif 2007–kharif 2014) are assessed by considering a set of performance indicators, namely average sum insured per insured cropped area, percentage of loanee and non-loanee farmers covered, average area insured per farmer, total claim ratio, farmer claim ratio, premium as percentage of sum insured, gross profit to insurance agencies. The study finds that claim payout can increase farmers’ coverage under PMFBY while subsidy and actuarial premium rate significantly impact farmers’ coverage for WBCIS. However, as recourse to complement the performance of two schemes, we propose a total insurance package like seed insurance through replanting guarantee programme, crop cycle insurance, prepaid insurance card, to name a few.||Kushankur Dey,Debasish Maitra
29-12-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||It Is Not Just about Fences : Dynamics of Human–Wildlife Conflict in Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand||Discussions on human–wildlife conflict in India typically take place within a narrow frame, viewing the problem as a result of human “encroachment” into wildlife territories, and hence, one that primarily needs to be addressed by “compensating,” relocating or “protecting” local communities. Most research focuses on protected areas and severely underestimates the scale of the problem. This study, based on field surveys in Tamil Nadu and Uttarakhand, throws up a different picture, where conflict is a major problem, but one to which structures and practices of forest management in the country are a central contributor. It also points to how more democratic and rights-respecting approaches to forest management must be an essential part of any solution.||Shankar Gopalakrishnan,Terpan Singh Chauhan,M S Selvaraj
29-12-2017||notes||---------||Housing for the Urban Poor? : Changes in Credit-linked Subsidy||Recent modifications in the credit linked subsidy scheme—an important vertical under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban)—have raised the income limits for eligibility of loans, increased the amount of subsidised loans, relaxed norms with regard to built-up area, and importantly, have included the middle-income group, diluting its core agenda of being “pro-poor.” While this would boost the housing sector, there is risk that subsidies will be cornered by real estate developers, private builders, and the urban middle class. The planners must view this development with concern.||Amitabh Kundu,Arjun Kumar

Widespread scepticism and apprehensions regarding the various provisions of the FRDI Bill, particularly the bail-in provision, have already forced the government to pause, as the Joint Parliamentary Committee studying the bill has been given time till the end of the next budget session to finalise its report.

This article argues that these are reactionary steps to the centre's rigorous policy of promoting Hindi along with the larger agenda of negating federal principles. Such policies threaten the diversity and federalism of India. The states' fear of the central government's ideology of monopolising faith, education, and language will adversely affect the Indian political system, which is based on pluralism and accommodation. The policies of the centre as well as states should be viewed with precaution as they further advance the politics of majoritarianism.||

This happens despite the Municipal Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016 which explicitly restrict landfill use only for disposal of inert, non-recyclable, and non-biodegradable waste and also mandate waste generators to segregate waste before it is collected. It is widely acknowledged that waste segregation at the household level is the most efficient way to address this problem. In practice, however, inducing such behaviour at the household level is a challenge for public authorities responsible for waste management. This study has found low cost interventions such as information and norms to be effective in inducing favourable behavioural change.||

22-12-2017||special articles||---------||Defining Backwardness : Debates in Bombay/Maharashtra||Various communities across the country have been demanding reservation on the basis of their social backwardness. The notion of “backwardness” seems to have attached itself to a given caste’s “position” or “status” in the traditional Hindu caste hierarchy. This is inevitable since the Constitution talks of social backwardness, in addition to educational backwardness. But as this paper argues in the debates over “backwardness” in the Marathi-speaking areas of the Bombay Presidency in the colonial period it was educational backwardness that was regarded as the primary criterion to determine whether a caste was backward or not, while in the early years of Maharashtra in the post-1947 period the criterion was primarily economic. Social backwardness was not regarded as a defining criterion, and thus can be considered as a recent entrant into the entire debate of defining the “backward.” Also, discussions on whether a community would cease to be backward if it fulfils certain conditions are practically missing in the present time.||Abhay Datar

Since they cannot allow the new bubbles to give in, policymakers must persist with decisions that inflate asset prices. By doing so, they end up sitting one more bubble on the previous one. The probability that one or both may burst has only increased.||C P Chandrasekhar
15-12-2017||commentary||---------||The Afrazul Killing Video as a Perfect Anti-Muslim Crime||The video with the killing of Mohammad Afrazul by Shambhunath Raigar in cold blood, without any immediate motivation or excuse, is a watershed moment in the new-age social-media-driven communal crime in India. Where all such hate crime shared on social media, especially lynchings, builds an ever-present sense of fear for the Muslim, this video does away with all padding, any semblance of rationale, the use of passion as motivator, and mob as executive. This is a radical break from the past where the Hindu right felt a need to justify itself even to the rest of the country.||Maaz bin Bilal

The formation of the collective not only challenges the patriarchal world view of Indian cinema, but has dragged into the limelight the ugly underbelly of commercial film-making controlled by cliques, cartels, and celebrity power. On a more positive front, it prepares the ground for women who are joining the film industry in larger numbers to lay claim to legitimate spaces for self-actualisation and creative satisfaction.||Tara S Nair

The act has made people aware of their rights and, by and large, has been used effectively. However, some provisions of the act leave its users perplexed. This article analyses these provisions and rules that leave interpretation and implementation open to considerable subjectivity. It argues that the practical regime of the RTI Act thusremains labyrinthine.||Pankaj K P Shreyaskar

However, in 2016, the Supreme Court sent a clear message that any irresponsible exercise of the state’s power to restrict protestors’ right to free speech and expression willattract legal consequences and not just censure. This decision is likely to be a landmark in constitutional actions against the state in the context of the right to protest and corresponding limits on state action.||Akaant Kumar Mittal

14-12-2017||special articles||---------||Impact of Aadhaar on Welfare Programmes||India’s ambitious biometric identity documents project, Aadhaar, was portrayed as one that would enhance India’s welfare efforts by promoting inclusion and reducing corruption. From being a voluntary ID, it has become de facto compulsory for most welfare programmes. Despite early warnings of its limited role in achieving its stated objectives, successive governments have ramped up its use. Using a variety of sources, a review of the impact of Aadhaar on welfare programmes is presented. It is found that far from being inclusive and reducing corruption, Aadhaar is becoming a tool of exclusion. The government’s estimates of savings also do not stand up to scrutiny, and whatever is termed as savings is often the result of a denial of legal entitlements. In its current form, the Aadhaar project undermines the right to life.||Reetika Khera

Spanning the socialist feminists of early 19th century Europe, Marx’s own writings on the “woman question,” and the scholarship that emerges from the 1960s and 1970s, this paper suggests that recent post-Marxist work can offer a fruitful site for pushing the boundaries of feminist approaches to capitalist development in India today.||Mary E John
15-12-2017||special articles||---------||Theorising the Disability Experience : ‘Power’ Is the Key||This paper illustrates how power relations in a society dominated by an able-bodied majority provide structural sanctions for the oppression and exclusion of the disabled. It critically evaluates the approaches developed by Kalpana Kannabiran and Martha Nussbaum to liberate the disabled, arguing that their basic premises are located within the able-bodied power paradigm. A fresh starting point for academicians and disability rights activists calls for a relocation of disability rights jurisprudence within the broader scheme of the power relations operating in a society. The elimination of the subject of power, the “other,” through a model of self-reflection, and the creation of an expansive notion of the self is essential in constructing a theoretical foundation for equal citizenship.||Devi Jagani

15-12-2017||-------||---------||Caste-Gender Matrix and the Promise and Practice of Academia||The dilemmas arising from the “list” and the “statement” have compelled us to reflect on contemporary feminist politics and concede that cultures of sexual violence are pervasive in academia. This article attempts to contextualise the dilemma from a (Dalit/ex-untouchable) feminist perspective. It underlines the unresolved caste question in the academy and the Indian feminist movement. Brahminical patriarchal violence, misogynistic caste cultures, the social composition of committees that adjudicate “due process,” lack of faculty diversity, as endemic features that affect women and vulnerable communities. The article underscores that women from Dalit backgrounds are specifically vulnerable, and the existence of such a list is a result and response to institutional failure. Yet the possibilities of misuse of such lists show vulnerabilities of both, victims of sexual violence and the alleged perpetrators in a charged political climate where such tools can be used against “progressive” and anti-caste Dalit voices.||

The bill also provided substantial opportunity for private medical establishments to be part of the regulatory process, thereby defeating the very purpose of regulation. PMEs misrepresented the bill as “draconian” and rejected the amendments. PME’s resistance to the bill is part of the larger resistance of the medical fraternity in general to any regulation. This has led to a crisis in both the public and private health sectors. While the KPME Bill is an important first step in ensuring accountability of the private health sector, the Karnataka government needs to also increase budgetary allocation for the public health system and reverse its pro-private healthcare policies.||

Considering the bias that exists in terms of class, caste, gender and religion in the implementation of law, one wonders what would be the real gains of bringing personal law more and more within the purview of the policing system.

This article attempts to contrast the notion of a growth rate that is normally employed in the growth theory with y-o-y quarterly rates for the Indian economy.

This article argues that its success in Andhra Pradesh depended heavily on how the ideas within the rural development bureaucracy interacted with the political executive. This synergy engendered a state’s capacity to insulate a committed bureaucracy from powerful farmers and construction companies who had a clear interest in thwarting the programme. Elections can in a democracy elevate citizen concern over particularistic populism, when political will is matched by ideational conviction in the bureaucracy.||Rahul Mukherji,Himanshu Jha

A focus on the anti-khoti struggle in the Konkan region and the working class struggle in Bombay, under Ambedkar’s leadership through the Independent Labour Party during 1936–42, allows for a deeper exploration of this ideological position. Ambedkar’s formulation and emphasis of the “untouchables’ question” in class struggle, then and now, has continued to disrupt traditional formulations of working class solidarity.||Santosh Suradkar

The problems lie not just in the definitions but also in methods of estimation. A glaring lacuna in this process is that sporadic or irregular attendance is not taken into account when estimating the number. This paper unpacks the phenomenon through an intensive micro-study of enrolment and attendance of all children in a single panchayat in India. It shows that irregular attendance accounts for a much larger proportion of out-of-school children, with wide variation in attendance across social groups. It also conducts a regression analysis to analyse school and household-level factors that affect student attendance. It finds that school-level factors play a much larger role in determining student attendance.||Kiran Bhatty,Radhika Saraf,Vrinda Gupta

Using concentration indices, Kaleckian “mark-up,” and wage rate, relationships between market concentration, monopoly power, and wage growth are examined. A panel data analysis shows that the impact of market competition on industry wage structure is dialectical: firms with higher market power pay higher wages compared to competitors; however, if the market power translated into a monopoly position, then the company may resort to cost-cutting, leading to relatively decreasing wage growth. The panel regression shows that, other things held constant, fewer firms with prudential regulation for monopoly power would lead to higher wage growth.||Ashish Kumar Sedai

Using household-level expenditure data from three “thick” rounds of the Household Consumer Expenditure Survey (1993–94, 2004–05, and 2011–12), we present evidence of two empirical trends. First, a significant portion of demand for services comes from poor households; and second, a puzzling trend has emerged since 2004–05—the shrinking of the difference in the share of monthly expenditure spent on services between rich and poor households. We present a simple model of consumer behaviour with a hierarchy of preferences, lexicographic ordering, and consumption thresholds to evaluate this puzzle.||Deepankar Basu,Debarshi Das
01-12-2017||special articles||---------||Viewing National Water Policies through a Gendered Lens||Despite the international recognition accorded to the key role played by women in issues around water, the extent to which India’s national water policies accommodate gender concerns remains to be examined. Based on an in-depth content analysis of the three nwps—of 1987, 2002, and 2012—this paper argues that incorporation of women in the planning, provisioning, and management of water resources continues to be disregarded. Women’s concerns in the water sector are articulated around their domestic roles and subsumed under notions of “household” and “social equity.” The larger questions of water rights of women, both in terms of access and control over decision-making, remain unaddressed.||Tanusree Paul

Many neo-Marxist and cultural geographers have also adopted an ambivalent stance towards the primacy of space in social theory. As such, the lack of a meta-theory, ineffective integration of theories from other social science disciplines, and an inadequate conception of “space” have resulted in the increased marginalisation of geography and geographers in the social sciences.||Abdul Shaban

Besides the more immediate political causes that led to this historic change, there were also underlying problems in Zimbabwe’s economy over the last decade. Even land reforms that were instituted in 2000 did not stem the urge for political change even as sections of the population made gains. Zimbabwe is on a path to a new, albeit uncertain, future.||S Niyati,Freedom Mazwi

The initiative, however, appears to want to hold the United States at bay, which needs India and Pakistan talking to safeguard its Afghan engagement. The interlocutor’s mission will likely turn out to be yet another wasted opportunity in Kashmir.||Ali Ahmed
23-11-2017||commentary||---------||Education and Girlhood||The issue of “girlhood” rather than “girls” is tackled in an attempt to answer the question “What is education?” and the necessity for autonomy in education is considered. The Indian state’s psychological split between a tyrannical need for control and a benevolence towards its citizens is examined, which leads to an explanation of the diffi culty the state faces in engaging with the culture of girlhood. Finally, the hardships that girls experience with regard to education today are outlined.||Krishna Kumar
23-11-2017||commentary||---------||Modernity and Meritocracy : Searching for a Fourth Way||The vision of a meritocracy is integral to modernity, resting upon principles of achievement, individualism, and the primacy of academic knowledge.

Among the four responses that are possible, a multifactor approach to social inequality in selection, social interventions, and institutional, academic support may actually be truest to modernity’s promise of freedom and fairness.||Amman Madan

23-11-2017||perspectives||---------||Macroeconomic Policy for an India in Transition||Two types of macroeconomic policies, categorised as Type I and Type II, are developed. A comparison shows why Type II would lead to better growth and infl ation outcomes in the Indian context. Analytical frameworks, data, and fundamentals, all of which are found to support Type II policy, are discussed, showing that India’s recent macroeconomic policy has tended towards that of Type I. This implies that growth and employment creation fall below potential even as the potential itself falls. Ironically, the primary infl ation expectations anchoring the function of infl ation targeting are underutilised.||Ashima Goyal

In these discussions, the “common man” emerged as the central character used by the ruling and opposition parties as well as the print media to defend or oppose the policy. This article deconstructs the characteristics of the common man as revealed in these assertions, and analyses the related narrative strategies employed to justify their respective position. Content analysis of a sample of 779 newspaper articles published by four leading English newspapers in India informs the analysis presented in this article.||Gautam Prateek,Richard Knopf,Bjorn C Peterson

This combination of historical and genetic analysis creates a new research tool for assessing the evolution of social identities through migration across regions, and points to the potential for interdisciplinary research that combines the humanities and genetic science.||Luca Pagani,Sarmila Bose,Qasim Ayub,Chris Tyler-Smith

Although relatively an economically and socially disadvantaged state, the infant mortality rate in Bihar is very close to the all-India average. We explore the reasons for the differential performance of different districts by using data envelopment analysis. The efficiency rankings from our results indicate a mix of inefficiency, inadequacy of inputs, and the presence of an optimal targeting of funds under the National Rural Health Mission to low-performing districts.||Brijesh C Purohit
23-11-2017||special articles||---------||On the Importance of Triangulating Data Sets to Examine Indians on the Move||A chapter dedicated to migration in the Economic Survey 2016–17 signals the willingness on the part of Indian policymakers to address the linkages between migration, labour markets, and economic development. This paper attempts to take forward this discussion. We comment on the salient mobility trends in India gleaned from existing data sets, and then compare and critique estimates of the Economic Survey with traditional data sets. After highlighting the data and resultant knowledge gaps, the article comments on the possibility of using innovative data sources and methods to understand migration and human mobility. It also offers ideas on how an enhanced understanding of mobility is important for policy interventions for those individuals who change locations permanently and those who move seasonally.||S Chandrasekhar,Mukta Naik,Shamindra Nath Roy
23-11-2017||special articles||---------||‘Timepass’ Development : Situating Social Media in Rural Rajasthan||​Significant empirical gaps between the technocratic discourse and the grass-roots experiences of technology are exemplified by the growing usage of social and digital media in rural areas where Information and Communications Technologies for Development and e-governance pilot projects have failed to meet their goals. Based on an ethnographic study of information and communication technologies in two villages of Rajasthan, the paper aims to situate social and digital media in the complex rural society and media ecology using co-constructivist approaches. Focusing on context-sensitive meaning-making of icts, the paper seeks to contribute to an empirically sound discourse on media, technology and rural society in India.||Sandeep Mertia

It is found that antibiotic usage varies across different parameters: the types of symptoms, the primary source providing medical advice/ treatment, number of days the patient was ill, age group of the patient, and the month in which the survey was conducted.||Thiagu Ranganathan
24-11-2017||notes||---------||Suicide or Domestic Violence?||The vulnerability of women from affluent background to domestic violence is examined by critically analysing the act of “suicide” of Bollywood actors. It argues for the adoption of a sociolegal perspective, where an act of suicide in an intimate relationship must be examined in the broader context of the social order by drawing on perspectives of domestic violence literature and the language of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005. This approach is critical to recognising that victims of domestic violence exist in all strata of society and that the act of suicide is the culmination of a process of enduring violence in intimate relationships encompassing multiple forms of victimisation.||Amrita Mukhopadhyay

The silence in the public sphere around environmental issues reflects the scalar distribution of political power, the limitations of existing grievance-sharing mechanisms, and the predominance of ethnicity as a key variable in negotiations around the environment.||Mona Chettri

This paper presents insights gained from new maps of India’s material and cultural regions, manifestations of the spatial patterns of Indian capitalism. Specifically, the focus is on regions of agrarian structure (rent, petty production, and capitalist production and exchange relations) and regions of social identity (caste, ethnicity, and gender).||Barbara Harriss-White
15-11-2017||regional political economy||---------||Three Planes of Space : Examining Regions Theoretically in India||There are three ways of looking at the question of regionality in India: “generalisation,” “fragmentation” and “composition.” Generalisation means gathering primary information from a determinate region, and assuming that all parts of India possess identical or similar characteristics. Fragmentation means believing that, since the regions are so fundamentally real, nothing existing beyond the regional level has any serious, compelling historical reality. Composition asserts that regions are historical and remain bound together within one single frame of some kind: political, economic or cultural.||Sudipta Kaviraj
15-11-2017||regional political economy||---------||Delhi’s ‘Regional’ Capitalism||The regional capitalism of Delhi described in this article is not a minor energy in the world today. It has abandoned some of its more provincial ways and also realised that the particular skills it possesses—the skills of infiltrating the political machine, the skills of using licit and illicit money, or legal and extralegal techniques— open up an immense zone of economic operation that is largely closed, say, to American corporations.||Rana Dasgupta
15-11-2017||regional political economy||---------||The Agrarian Question amidst Populist Welfare : Interpreting Tamil Nadu’s Emerging Rural Economy||Tamil Nadu’s emergence as a developmental model rests on its ability to combine economic growth with poverty reduction and high levels of human development. Scholars attribute such outcomes to a set of social policies implemented in response to a long history of “democratic action.” It is, however, not clear whether such intervention through social policies can also enable a more inclusive trajectory of economic development. This paper uses the analytical lens of the “agrarian question” to examine this aspect of the state’s development. In doing so, the paper argues that while social welfare nets are crucial to negotiate the vulnerabilities of a market-driven growth process and open up new political and economic spaces, they are inadequate in a context where the secondary sector has not been able to absorb labour to the extent anticipated.||M Vijayabaskar
15-11-2017||regional political economy||---------||First Nature and the State : Non-emergence of Regional Capital in Mandya||The process of policymaking in India has largely ignored the nature of the interaction between nature and institutions. One aspect of this interaction, that is, the consequences of the efforts of the state to overcome the constraints posed by nature is discussed in this essay. It does so by taking William Cronon’s concept of first nature to the southern Karnataka district of Mandya to argue that, despite the success of the Krishnaraja Sagar dam, small peasant agriculture that was the consequence, at least in part, of first nature limited the growth of agrarian capital in the district, leaving it dependent on state capital.||Narendar Pani
15-11-2017||regional political economy||---------||Regional Economies and Small Farmers in Karnataka||The divergence between economic growth and equality in the Indian context can be attributed to the disconnect between the macroeconomy and regional rural economies that host small landholdings. Comparing the agrarian peripheries of two distinct capital-accumulating urban areas in Karnataka, a decipherable pattern in distributional outcomes, food and livelihood security as well as sustainability are revealed. The portrayal of capital-centric urbanisation as an opportunity for livelihoods and poverty reduction among India’s agrarian communities is questioned.||Seema Purushothaman,Sheetal Patil
15-11-2017||regional political economy||---------||Space and Time Through an Urban-Industrial Hinterland||Ethnographic accounts have provided vivid accounts of the colonial encounter, and encounters with industrial capitalism. This article argues that space be seen as an encounter of time(s). It concurs with Doreen Massey’s thesis of space as a combination of trajectories and a place as a socio-historical event. A major force that shapes the contours and trajectories of space is capital. This is a preliminary attempt to process theoretically the entanglements of time and space, based on ethnographic research in Howrah. Structures of globally dispersed systems of capital shape a particular slice of landscape on the west bank of a river a little north of the Bay of Bengal.||Atreyee Majumder

In this paper, we discuss how three major flagship social protection government programmes—the Targeted Public Distribution System, the Mid-day Meal Scheme, and the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act—can be made more nutrition sensitive. We discuss three potential approaches to making these programmes deliver better nutrition outcomes. These are strengthening governance and operations so that the programmes achieve their basic goals of improving food security and poverty; integrating nutrition goals and actions for each of these programmes; and leveraging the reach and scale of these programmes to also deliver specific nutrition interventions via these programmes, especially the tpds.||Kalyani Raghunathan,Suman Chakrabarti,Purnima Menon,Harold Alderman

Theiit Bombay network was unable to provide connectivity quickly enough for rapidly growing demand.nptel has been able to cater to the huge demand for quality content.

Generally, such estimation is based on a desired gross domestic product growth. However, even achieving this GDP may not necessarily ensure the satisfaction of everyone’s basic needs. Energy planning should link energy and its end-use and end-user directly, promoting equity, and providing a better monitoring framework for energy use. End-use focused, bottom-up, disaggregated energy planning is such an approach and we urge that this should be the basis of energy planning in the country.||Shripad Dharmadhikary,Rutuja Bhalerao

This study looks at how investment in health has since taken place in India with the withdrawal of the state from healthcare, transformation of healthcare into a commodity, and promotion of the private healthcare sector by the state. This has led to an unregulated industry that is aggressively seeking expansion and profits from the provision of healthcare, and attracting investments by global finance capital.||Indira Chakravarthi,Bijoya Roy,Indranil Mukhopadhyay,Susana Barria

The key question is whether (and on what terms) India needs the Broadcasters Treaty. Existing digital divides make traditional broadcasting the primary means of mass communication in India.

It proposes a number of interventions that include revisiting the marine fisheries regulatory acts, expanding regulation to areas beyond territorial waters, carrying out commensurate institutional reforms, harnessing technological advancements, facilitating co-governance along with relevant stakeholders, operationalising the fao Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, and garnering multilateral cooperation.||Shinoj Parappurathu,C Ramachandran
09-11-2017||special articles||---------||Mediating Matrimonial Disputes in India : Trends from the Bangalore Mediation Centre||Dispute resolution through negotiation has long been a part of the Indian legal tradition, though the Civil Procedure Code, 1908, was only amended in 1999 to include different mechanisms for out-of-court dispute resolution. This amendment brought mediation into focus as a key form of alternate dispute resolution. Data from Bangalore Mediation Centre points to issues in the mediation framework that must be addressed before mediation can be seen as an effective mechanism to resolve matrimonial disputes. These include inadequate training of mediators, judges giving mediation referrals without proper consideration, gendered power imbalances, and prioritising the institution of marriage over individuals’ interests. This paper argues for an evidence-based approach to studying matrimonial cases and mediation.||Kritika Vohra

In the absence of any empirical evidence, this phenomenon is often attributed by the media and political commentators to middle-class apathy and their disdain towards electoral politics. This article contests the popular claim and argues that in big cities, it is not the middle class but the urban poor who are unable to exercise their franchise.||Sanjay Kumar,Souradeep Banerjee

As a result, MGNREGA workers have been victims of stagnating real wages. In some states, they are paid even less than the minimum wage. This raises serious questions of legality and fairness.||Ankita Aggarwal

This article examines some of the underlying themes and implications of the judgment: in particular, its affirmation of the individual as the basic normative unit of the Constitution, its elaboration of privacy in terms of bodily integrity, informational self-determination, and decisional autonomy, and the narrow framework within which the state may impose limitations upon it.||Gautam Bhatia

It is adequately empowered to bring political parties under the ambit of the Right to Information Act and order full disclosure of all donations received by them. No additional legislation is required.||V Bhaskar
03-11-2017||russian revolution centenary special||---------||Revolutionary Expectations in 1917 Russia||The February Revolution of 1917 not only overthrew the Russian monarchy but raised great expectations among the population. The essay looks at the expectations of several key segments—workers, soldiers, women, peasants, upper and middle classes, and nationalities. As the Provisional Government was slow to fulfil their expectations, the population turned leftward politically. In a matter of months this led to the rise of the extreme left and the Bolshevik seizure of power.||Rex A Wade
03-11-2017||russian revolution centenary special||---------||The Bolsheviks Come to Power in Petrograd : Centennial Reflections||How did the Bolsheviks win out in the struggle for power in 1917 Petrograd? The author, among the world’s leading historians on the Bolsheviks, the Russian Revolution of 1917, and the Russian civil war, revisits the conclusions of two of his major works, Prelude to Revolution: The Petrograd Bolsheviks and the July 1917 Uprising (1968) and The Bolsheviks Come to Power: The Revolution of 1917 in Petrograd (1976), to grapple with this still thorny and deeply politicised question.||Alexander Rabinowitch
03-11-2017||russian revolution centenary special||---------||The Bolshevik Heritage||The Russian Revolution of 1917 is one of the most enigmatic events of modern history. It arose out of massive popular disgust with war; yet heralded a civil war leading to an even greater loss of life. The revolution began with a quest for democracy, yet resulted in a regime wherein the political police took centre stage in the lives not only of political opponents but of the ruling party itself. It was legitimised in the name of the soviets, yet in three years these organs of workers’ power were reduced to shadows of their former selves. Its success was based upon a worker–peasant alliance, yetthat alliance was torn to shreds long before the collectivisation of the 1930s. Was it one revolution or two? Was the second one the “real” revolution or did it put an end to the aspirations of the first? Did Bolshevism signify living proof of the so-called Marxist “laws of history,” or the completely contingent nature of historical events? These questions are part of the enigma of Bolshevism. A century after the revolution unfolded, we have the benefit not only of hindsight, but also of a massive, hitherto unseen archive, made accessible after 1991. An entire century passed in the shadow of 1917.It is time to think of it afresh.||Dilip Simeon
03-11-2017||russian revolution centenary special||---------||Revolutionary Democracy in 1917 and the Bolsheviks||It was the highly proletarianised Bolshevik party that was central to revolutionary democracy coming into being in 1917, but the bulk of the non-Bolshevik left chose to go along with liberalism. Hostile to any notion of revolutionary democracy in opposition to bourgeois institutions, the major non-Bolshevik left parties felt more at ease with the liberals than with the “dark” proletarian masses, who appeared uneducated or semi-educated, and who seemed to be moved by illusions rather than the left intelligentsia’s doctrinaire understanding of Marxism. What mainly killed the fledgling revolutionary democracy was the reluctance of the other socialist parties to form a government with the Bolsheviks on the basis of an acceptance of the Congress of Soviets as the foundation of that proposed government’s power. The Left Socialist Revolutionaries pulling out of the Soviet government and the coming of the Civil War did the rest.||Kunal Chattopadhyay
03-11-2017||russian revolution centenary special||---------||Why Leninism and Bolshevism Are Not the Same||The essay closely investigates and questions the assumptions that Leninist theory is more or less a consistent whole, which must be accepted or rejected in its entirety, and that Bolshevik policy under Tsarism was the direct result of Leninist theory—that Bolshevism and Leninism are synonyms. It tries to determine the position of Lenin’s theory in its historical-materialist context, concentrating on his method of analysis and his theories of proletarian consciousness and the revolutionary party. It then deduces some important internal inconsistencies in Lenin’s methodology and organisational theory, and attempts to prove that Bolshevik practice was in no way Leninist. What then follows is a brief formulation of some consequences.||Marcel Van Der Linden
03-11-2017||russian revolution centenary special||---------||Bolsheviks and Feminists : In Cooperation and Conflict||Marxist attempts at integrating gender in the class-struggle framework was uneven in the Russian revolutionary movement. A class reductionism often held back the Bolsheviks, but contests with the liberal feminists, as well as the objective reality of more women entering the labour force, led to changes. Women activists took the lead in this. The Revolution of 1917 saw a much greater degree of women’s involvement. Women workers provided leadership in the early stages of the February Revolution, though it often remains unacknowledged by mainstream (including mainstream left) historiography of the revolution. At the same time, gendering the practice of class went hand in hand with a sharp rise in class issues against undifferentiated feminism, for liberal feminism supported the war and the bourgeois Provisional Government.||Soma Marik
03-11-2017||russian revolution centenary special||---------||The Russian Revolution, the Third International and the Colonial Question||The establishment of the Communist International and the installation of Soviet power contributed to a new understanding of the colonial question, as revealed in the deliberations of the Comintern Congresses. The setback of the European revolutions largely contributed to the recognition of the crucial importance of the colonial question by the Comintern, ideologically and organisationally. But the relations between the communist parties in the colonies and the metropolitan countries, together with the growing “Russification” of the Comintern, blocked many of its possibilities.||Sobhanlal Datta Gupta
03-11-2017||special articles||---------||Democracy in Jail : Over-representation of Minorities in Indian Prisons||Based on data from the Prison Statistics India, this article demonstrates an over-representation of minorities such as Muslims, Adivasis, and Dalits in Indian jails. It offers an anthropological and sociological analysis of this over-representation. The authors connect it to structural–political factors, a connection the scant Indian literature rarely makes. They relate the data to literature on over-representation of minorities in jails in Western democracies, about which scholars use terms such as “penal democracy” and “punishing democracy.” The authors then draw on recent memoirs of imprisoned Indian “terrorists,” and argue that their imprisonment generates a notion of democracy that is conceivably an alternative. At its heart is the identification imprisonment generates amongst fellow humans through a shared vocabulary of injustice, pain, human finitude, and vulnerability.||Irfan Ahmad,Md Zakaria Siddiqui
03-11-2017||special articles||---------||Rags to Riches? Intergenerational Occupational Mobility in India||The paper examines intergenerational occupational mobility in India among males. This analysis differs from previous work in three important respects. First, a finer-grained categorisation that takes into account differences in skill levels across occupations as well as India’s social hierarchy of labour is used. Second, both large and moderate ascents and descents are examined. Third, the situation in India with mobility patterns at other times and in other countries is compared. The results show vast differences in the upward and downward mobility prospects of urban and rural residents and upper-caste Hindus versus Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. The findings also reveal that downward mobility risks loom large in India and that mobility patterns in India and China appear remarkably similar.||Vegard Iversen,Anirudh Krishna,Kunal Sen

26-10-2017||review of women's studies||---------||Inhabiting or Interrogating Faith : Piety among Muslim Women in Mumbai||Against the growing literature on Muslim piety movements, this paper analyses the practices of faith among a young generation of educated middle-class Muslim women in Mumbai in the context of a liberalising economy, which offers them greater employment opportunities and draws them out of the ghettos to work and interact with people of different social and religious backgrounds. The paper shows that these women question and reason with their faith, while the earlier generation abides by a quieter piety. The findings are grounded in Mumbai’s specific history in which the riots of 1992–93 were a defining moment for Muslims. While focusing on everyday religiosity, it also connects with a larger canvas by arguing that piety movements, though located in society, are not unattached from the ways in which states may constitute secularity or define religious freedoms.||Tanvi Patel-Banerjee,Rowena Robinson
26-10-2017||review of women's studies||---------||Women and Religiosity : Dalit Christianity in Kerala||The everyday life of the congregations of slave castes involved the active support of women, right from the mid-19th century when Dalit communities began to accept Christianity. Prayers in the family and in congregations were occasions in which women were substantially involved, wherein hymns/songs became powerful articulations of the critique of caste slavery and prayer was used as an effective tool to resist instances of caste oppression. However, relatively blurred gender hierarchies in the pre-Christian phase among the slave castes were transformed by the conscious intervention of the missionaries in favour of the secure family structure with an assertive male head.||P Sanal Mohan
26-10-2017||review of women's studies||---------||Inter-caste Marriage and Shakta Myths of Karnataka||The annual jatras or fairs conducted for certain female deities like Maramma and Dyamavva in Karnataka include the ritual of buffalo sacrifice. There is an accompanying myth that explains this sacrifice as symbolising the punishment meted out to a Dalit boy who had married an upper-caste girl by concealing his caste identity. Karnataka is one of the states where love marriages provoke honour killings, where the Sangh Parivar—as part of its “love jihad” campaign—attacks inter-religious couples, and beats up meat-eaters. Do these jatra practices, rooted in ancient memories, still serve the purpose of protecting the sanctity of caste?In what way have new developments changed the traditional meanings associated with the mythand the practice?||Rahamath Tarikere

This paper explores the spaces of egalitarianism among them and finds out what opportunities for gendered negotiations and authority for women within the sphere of the religions are nurtured within an overarching framework of patriarchy.||Bhanumathi Kalluri

Some disaffiliation, if not actual animosity, is often assumed between science and religion, sometimes placed in relation to larger concepts such as “modernity” and “tradition.” But, developments in Iran over the past three decades reveal the coming together of science and religion; these have generated possibilities for living alternatively gendered and sexual lives. The implications of some of these developments are explored.||Afsaneh Najmabadi
26-10-2017||review of women's studies||---------||Muslim Women and the Challenge of Religion in Contemporary Mumbai||Two recent mobilisations of women in Mumbai expose the tension between Muslim patriarchies and women’s rights in contemporary Islam. The first case refers to a petition in the Bombay High Court filed by the Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan that challenged the prohibition of women in the inner sanctum of the Haji Ali Dargah. In 2016, the Supreme Court ruled against the governing trust of Haji Ali Dargah and restored women’s right to enter the inner sanctum. The second mobilisation was spearheaded by Sahiyo, a group of five women who started a public conversation around the practice of khafz or female genital cutting among Dawoodi Bohras. Their efforts brought attention to the violent control of female sexual pleasure in the name of religion and tradition. This paper argues that women’s critical voices from within the community challenge conservatism and redefine gendered selfhood within the religious realm.||Qudsiya Contractor
25-10-2017||insight||---------||Transparency in Appointing the CAG||The Comptroller and Auditor General is essential in overseeing government finances and ensuring public accountability. Post-independence, public expenditure has increased hundredfold, with no clear accountability structure in place. New regulatory bodies have been created, and a good number of government transactions have been computerised. These developments pose new challenges for public audits, which require the CAG to reinvent itself. This entails more professionalism in its working, wider power delegation, and fundamental reforms in its structural organisation. Our government should not be afraid of such reforms, since conditions have fundamentally changed from when the Constitution came into effect, in 1950.||B P Mathur

This petroleum-related foreign direct investment and trade can be mutually beneficial in the short term, providing African exporters with a foreign market and helping India meet its energy needs. Such deals may become less effective economically over the medium and long term, however, given the increasing availability and cost-competitiveness of renewable energies, an array of restrictions and taxes on carbon emissions, and diminishing returns in the ratio of energy production to energy output.||Rick Rowden

Some important considerations emerge from this. First, what is the potential of Himalay Diwas in highlighting the environmental issues faced by the region? Second, when research has shown that the past environmental movements (in the state) have actually been misrepresented and have created environmental injustices for the local populations (Bandyopadhyay 1999; Rangan 2000), to what extent does Himalay Diwas address these local voices? Finally, does the day receive attention from and appeal to the masses?

Indian action was triggered by consistent Pakistani denial of “consular access,” a minimal courtesy extended by all civilised states to nationals of another state, when they face charges under the local law.

This tax can therefore be thought of as the government’s way of incentivising cashless transactions in the country.||Shubham Kundal,Mukul Agarwal

Through a field study of 10 mandis across the state, we find that while Karnataka has been consistently pushing through with reforms, in the context of deeply entrenched relationships between farmers, traders and commission agents, there remain significant challenges. We argue, based on Karnataka’s experience, that agricultural market reform in India rests on three pillars— institutions that establish the rules of the game, incentives for agents to participate actively in the market, and infrastructure to support the modernised trading platform. Unless reforms address all these three issues simultaneously, they are unlikely to succeed.||Nidhi Aggarwal,Sargam Jain,Sudha Narayanan

There have been, however, serious lapses in government policy that never prepared the sector to engage in hardware manufacturing, and India still stands at the low end of the value chain.

This is a significant step for India as it will now be less dependent on oil from West Asia, opening access to more risk-free oil and better prices. Yet concerns remain. India is consuming oil at a fast rate, while domestic production is falling. It will continue to be dependent on oil imports for its energy security, and will have to further diversify its sources of oil imports.||Pyaralal Raghavan

05-10-2017||special articles||---------||The Transfer of Jodhpur Railways, 1947–48 : Denials, Delays and Divisions||The process of partition between India and Pakistan, that is, dividing up material assets, remains an under-written subject, barring its border-building aspects. While the old scholarship offered an adversarial account of this exercise, the recent attempts revise this narrative by stressing upon the cooperation evinced by the two sides. Where the former found antagonism, the latter has sought to locate some mutually agreed method in the madness. Focusing on Jodhpur, a princely state, which has not found a place in this matrix, this paper brings together a slice of history from the integration of the princely states with the history of partition, a connection not usually made. Delineating a facet of early interdominion relations on the division of asset of a princely state, it questions the “two peas in a pod” seeking-consensus approach to early India–Pakistan relations that puts two unequal entities together on an equal plane.||Rakesh Ankit

How did contraception emerge as an economic virtue in family planning discourse, instead of a corporeal one? This paper interrogates whether poverty was the reigning theme in family planning, or the body, as the state—especially during the Emergency—moved from indirect interventions on the bodies of the poor through sterilisation programmes, incentives and disincentives, to the elimination of the poor themselves by demolishing their homes. When material poverty flowed into bodily poverty and transformed into an identity, Garibi Hatao became Garib Hatao.||Sayantani Sur

This article explores their interrelatedness, through a narrative anchored around the work and experience of two tertiary eye care hospitals in India. It seeks to illustrate that users not only influence care-providers, they can play a key role in forging producer identities. The girl child who comes to the clinic with the tumour is representative of many users. In responding to different complexities, the clinician emerges as an entity with multiple identities— as a “clinician–scientist–social activist.”||Pankaj Sekhsaria

Such an existence entails possibilities for complementarities and exchange, but also real dangers of misunderstanding and conflict. This calls for a threefold dialogue—with the poor, with cultures, and with religions—that must be defined in terms of a liberating, enriching, and transformational promise. Such a dialogue must be both inclusively Asian and open to the world, and universally global and concretely local. This pedagogic process must address the Asian situation characterised by poverty, cultural diversity and popular religiosity.||Rudolf C Heredia

Have increased public investments or farm subsidies contributed to reducing rural poverty, directly through various public spending schemes or indirectly through increased agricultural land productivity? Utilising a structural equation to answer this question for the period 1981–82 to 2013–14, it was found that education and agricultural research and development produced the highest marginal returns for promoting agricultural income, while investments in rural infrastructure development and health provisions are the most effective in reducing rural poverty.||Seema Bathla,Sukhadeo Thorat,P K Joshi,Bingxin Yu

A comparison of the social, cultural and political conditions in Vidarbha and Telangana reveals that the relatively greater presence of traditionally exploitative social relations in Vidarbha; narrow agrarian and rural social base of the distress therein; marginalisation of the rural in mainstream media; and greater importance of urban votes in the politics of Maharashtra have hampered the growth of sociopolitical mobilisation in Vidarbha, in contrast to Telangana. This has consequently led to the receding demand for a separate state of Vidarbha.||Nikhit Kumar Agrawal
28-09-2017||special articles||---------||Explaining Falling Female Employment during a High Growth Period||What explains the decline of the already low female labour force participation rate in India, particularly during a period of rapid economic growth? Women’s economic participation is influenced by interrelated factors, each important unto itself. Increased attendance in educational institutions, declining child labour, higher household income levels, structural shift away from agricultural employment, and increased mechanisation of agriculture were some of the factors found to be driving female employment trends. Additionally, it was found that in rural areas the decline in animal husbandry, and in urban areas a fall in international demand for products of labour-intensive industries, have also contributed to the decline as women were the main employees in these sectors. Policy must create an enabling environment for women’s economic participation in India.||Santosh Mehrotra,Sharmistha Sinha
28-09-2017||special articles||---------||School Interactional Milieu in Tribal Areas : Implications for Inclusive Education||School milieus in tribal areas consist of triadic actors, namely tribal and non-tribal students, and teachers. The social interactions between actors are likely to be inequitable, characterised by distrust, blame, shame and stigma. Inequitable interactions influence tribal students to identify themselves with others who belong to their own social groups. Tribal students and teachers form a dyad characterised through inequitable interactions within the school milieu, which results in socially excluding and psychosocially disabling tribal students. On the other side, the interaction between non-tribal students and teachers evolves through increased sociocultural intimacy, acceptance and understanding. Responding to these, tribal students find it increasingly safe, secure and comfortable being a part of their own community by engaging deeply with it.||Justin P Jose

A review of the emerging literature and descriptive evidence from a district-level data set on Maoist conflict indicates that the relationship between underdevelopment andMaoist activity cannot be explained in simple economic terms. At the state level, Maoistconflict-affected states have similar growth trends and do not score lower on development measures. In a cross section of districts, the most robust predictor of Maoist activity is forest cover, which could reflect the importance of strategic terrain factors as well as the relevance of forest rights and forest produce.||Maitreesh Ghatak,Oliver Vanden Eynde

We suggest that these authors cheered too soon. Through evidence from coastal Tamil Nadu, we note the history of the debate among fishers on environmental and justice impacts of new technology. Fisher management skills are usually ignored by state agencies which also fail to govern effectively.

Unlike the Holocaust or partition, which have the gigantism of epic memories, the sadness of Kashmir is forged, crafted out of thousands of little memories, unwritten diaries merging quietly together. It is this alchemy of memories that is struggling against government policy, which sanitises violence and erases memory to create this strange machine that moves from violence to violence in facile amnesia.||Shiv Visvanathan
22-09-2017||special articles||---------||Towards Streamlining Panchayat Finance in India : A Study Based on Gram Panchayats in Kerala||Local governments have become the third tier of governance in Indian federal polity. For decentralisation to be successful, fiscal systems that make governments accountable to their citizens are needed. The absence of consistent data and reporting has made evaluating decentralisation difficult. In this paper, we utilise data from a well-designed sample of gram panchayats in Kerala to document fiscal management systems, extent of decentralisation of revenues, and local governments’ response to raising revenues using local capacity. Our findings suggest that the pressure to spend on welfare and development activities has outstripped development of revenue. However, there is some evidence that local governments have untapped revenue potential in their property tax. Importantly, we also find that state and federal government support vis-à-vis intergovernmental grants is not crowding out revenue mobilisation.||M A Oommen,Sally Wallace,Abdu Muwonge
22-09-2017||special articles||---------||Labour Law, Governance Reforms, and Protests : Are They Legitimate?||Employers and critics of labour regulation have been arguing for the liberalisation of labour laws, and for governance and compliance systems, following the liberalisation of the product market to enable firms to respond swiftly and suitably to fast-changing market conditions. The trade unions opposed this even as the government was seemingly favourably disposed towards employers’ demands. The countrywide strikes that have taken place since 1991 have become controversial not merely due to their high frequency but also for their lack of legitimacy as reforms appear to be a foregone conclusion and the protest politics seems to be vain and economically hurting the nation. This paper explores the dynamics of the countrywide strikes and examines whether some of the demands of trade unions are justified.||K R Shyam Sundar,Rahul Suresh Sapkal

The success of development banks critically hinges on: (i) access to assured sources of low-cost, long-term funds; (ii) public ownership and/or management; and (iii) the quality of institutional governance.

14-09-2017||das kapital, vol 1—150 years||---------||The Structure and Content of Das Kapital||Karl Marx’s magnum opus, Das Kapital, presents an analysis of the long-run dynamics of a mature capitalist economy. The analysis is conducted at two primary levels of abstraction—“capital in general” (where competition between individual capitals is abstracted from) and “many capitals” (where the phenomenon of competition between individual capitals is introduced)—and the presentation is organised into three volumes. In terms of structure, the analysis in the first two volumes is located at the level of “capital in general,” and the analysis in the third volume is located at the level of “many capitals.” In terms of content, the first volume analyses the production and accumulation of surplus value; the second volume investigates the problems of realisation of surplus value; and the third volume analyses the mechanisms that lead to the distribution of surplus value into income streams of different fractions of the ruling class—as profit of enterprise, commercial profit, interest and rent (and monopoly profit more generally). The three volumes together give a comprehensive picture of the workings of a mature capitalist economy and highlight its long-run, contradictory tendencies.||Deepankar Basu

Specifically, the possibilities of identification and authentication without consent using the Aadhaar number or biometric data, and unlawful access of Aadhaar data in the central repository are examined. The analysis suggests that privacy protection in Aadhaar will require an independent third party that can play the role of an online auditor; study of several modern tools and techniques from computer science; and strong legal and policy frameworks that can address the specifics of authentication and identification in a modern digital setting.||Shweta Agrawal,Subhashis Banerjee,Subodh Sharma
15-09-2017||special articles||---------||We Are the River, the River Is Us||As per the recent ruling of the Uttarakhand High Court, the Ganga and Yamuna rivers have rights as a “juristic/legal person/living entity.” It raises a complex set of questions. What does it mean for a river, and its associated natural elements, to have rights? What does it mean for them to have rights as a “person?” How would such rights be implemented, given that rivers and other elements of nature would not be able to claim and defend such rights for themselves? What implications do these two decisions have for not just the rivers and those living in/on/along them, but for the relationship between humans and the rest of nature? This article addresses these questions in order to find solutions.||Ashish Kothari,Shrishtee Bajpai

07-09-2017||special articles||---------||Social Responsibility of the Historian : The Annales’ Agenda in Perspective||Recent conflicts in India over what constitutes historical facts or "truths" have forced historians out of their ivory towers and into the public arena, adding urgency to reflections on the historian's social responsibility. Is it the historian's responsibility to expose manipulations of the historical past, point to social dysfunctions, and identify remedies? Or should the citizen historian nourish public debate on sensitive topics without taking a clear-cut position on them? This paper explains how the French journal, the Annales d'Histoire Economique et Sociale, established in 1929, has interpreted these questions, attempting to deal with problems of contemporary concern, but without making the shift from debate to polemics. Annales has been in favour of a non-emotional history, inviting historians to work with data, and reminding them that their primary role is to strengthen the citizen's understanding of the social mechanisms of change, not to take ideological positions themselves.||Arundhati Virmani

In these discussions, the “common man” emerged as the central character used by the ruling and opposition parties as well as the print media to defend or oppose the policy. Drawing upon narrative policy analysis, the article attempts to deconstruct the characteristics of the common man as revealed in the assertions of the ruling and opposition parties, and analyses the related narrative strategies employed to justify their respective position.

31-08-2017||special articles||---------||Trade Liberalisation and Women’s Employment Intensity : Analysis of India’s Manufacturing Industries||Whether trade can be used as an instrument for generating greater employment opportunities for women is an important question for policymakers in developing countries. This paper analyses the role of various trade-related factors in determining female employment intensity in a panel of India’s manufacturing industries during 1998–2011. Import tariff rate is found to exert a negative effect on female employment intensity, supporting the hypothesis that firms, when exposed to international competition, tend to reduce costs by substituting male with female workers. Further, the relative demand for female workers increases to the extent that trade liberalisation leads to resource reallocation in favour of unskilled labour-intensive industries. By contrast, greater use of new technology biases the gender composition of workforce against females. Liberalisation has not led to large growth of female employment in India because the resource reallocation effect has not been strong enough to offset the negative technology effect.||Purna Banerjee,C Veeramani

Yet, the several structural, regulatory, and information-driven distortions that afflict Indian land markets force lenders to adopt conservative policies ex ante, affecting both the availability of credit and the collateralisation of land. The paper examines some of these distortions and highlights their significance to the current debate on reforming bankruptcy framework in India. The first part of the paper discusses structural, regulatory, and informational gaps that limit lenders’ ability to lend against land as well as recovery after default. In the second part, some opportunistic and structural reforms in the land markets that could effectively monetise land in credit markets have been proposed.||K P Krishnan,Venkatesh Panchapagesan,Madalasa Venkataraman

On the one hand, liquidity is required for efficient functioning of the market and on the other, it may lead to excessive speculation, therefore defeating the objectives of price discovery and reduction in uncertainty. The analysis of futures markets begs the question with respect to agricultural commodity markets: are prices determined by real supply and demand or are they affected by financialisation and presence of speculators?||Surobhi Mukherjee

The lower castes that migrated from Hinduism to new faiths, attracted by the latter’s textual claims of egalitarianism and non-hierarchical world views, over the centuries found that there was a huge gap between its theoretical premises and everyday practices.

This worm’s-eye view of one such institute in a backward district of Maharashtra suggests that, far from being “dysfunctional,” the pre-service teacher education at these places is engaged and responsive to local needs. The problems encountered by student–teachers and teacher–educators have more to do with the neglect and arbitrary nature of the system than the negligence and dereliction of duty of actors and agents within the institution. The proposal by the ministry to do away with teacher education at these institutes demonstrates that policymaking is often based on assumption rather than reality, borne out by research.||Hisako Akai,Padma M Sarangapani

24-08-2017||-------||---------||Dangerous Speech in Real Time: Social Media, Policing, and Communal Violence||The article examines how a set of key actors—the police, civil society and social media platforms responded to a series of violent incidents in Pune in 2014 that resulted in the death of Mohsin Sheikh. The hate speech by the Hindu Rashtra Sena leaders; the murder of Sheikh; violence and arson against Muslims; the circulation of morphed images; the actions of the police and civil society groups, were all part of an ecosystem of events that occurred at the time. What is new here, when compared to earlier incidents of communal violence is the technology being used—social media through internet enabled mobile phones. This in turn raises a number of legal and technological questions that need to be investigated further.||

It is useful to examine reasons for this sharp preference for grain over cash against the background of national debates about cash transfers.||Devanshi Chanchani
29-08-2017||-------||---------||India’s Slip on Global Hunger Index||After witnessing an improvement from 2008 to 2014, India’s rank on Global Hunger Index slipped in 2016. This slip is attributed to reformulation of GHI to encompass the multidimensional character of malnutrition, wherein underweight was replaced by stunting and wasting. While GHI scores of several other countries witnessed a decline, India fared worse. This is explained through a stickiness in child stunting levels in India attributed to gendered norms, poor sanitation, and high regional concentration.||Neetu Choudhary

This is as good a time as any to reflect not just on the EPW’s past, but also on the future course it ought to take. For this, we need the participation and engagement of the wider EPW community.||
18-08-2017||law and society||---------||Rethinking the Surrogacy Bill||The Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016, introduced ostensibly to provide a legal framework for surrogacy in India, is a regressive legislation that seeks to control women’s bodies and reinforces heteronormative notions of what a family is. By limiting surrogacy to “altruistic surrogacy” only, it creates space for women being pressured to bear children for family members. The Rajya Sabha standing committee’s report, having heard a wide cross section of society on this matter, has rightly criticised this bill and called for its redrafting.||Alok Prasanna Kumar

17-08-2017||special articles||---------||Shift in MGNREGS from UPA to NDA||The approach of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance-II government towards the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme emphasises asset creation in a target-driven, if necessary, top-down fashion. NDA-II has done this without altering the basic features of the programme, as that needs an amendment in the act, a difficult political proposition given its lack of majority in the Rajya Sabha. Such a shift is in contradistinction to the pursuit of demand-driven job creation with a focus on participatory decentralised development under the United Progressive Alliance governments. While the emphasis on assets creation is not without its merits, the programme has been tilted in favour of agriculturists. Landless rural labour households, one-fourth of India’s rural population, have been excluded from the benefits of individual assets since they own no land. Asset fetishism may affect job creation and its target-driven pursuit may defeat objectives like promoting participatory decentralised development||Ashok Pankaj
18-08-2017||special articles||---------||Abductive Reasoning in Macroeconomics||Macroeconomic analytical frameworks change with events they are unable to explain. The process is closer to abductive reasoning that is based on both events and analysis, unlike induction which is data-based and deduction where analysis dominates. Abduction reasons backwards from the outcome to deduce the framework with which it is compatible. Therefore, it is useful to study how macroeconomic conceptual frameworks evolve after anomalous outcomes such as crises. The post-crisis churning is assessed from this perspective using criteria such as greater generality, systemic feedback, and structural aspects. Abductive reasoning is also used to extract the structure of aggregate demand and supply consistent with the observed negative correlation inflation and growth in India. If prolonged growth slowdowns do not reduce inflation, it suggests underlying aggregate supply is elastic but volatile, so that supply-side issues, not excess demand, are primary inflation drivers. Monetary and fiscal policy need to focus on elements that reduce costs, while avoiding sharp cuts in aggregate demand.||Ashima Goyal
18-08-2017||special articles||---------||Colonial ‘Shock’ and Global Inequalities : A Critical Review of New Institutional Economics||Recent literature in New Institutional Economics has sought to study the link between colonialism and global inequalities. This strand of analysis has received substantial attention in academic and policymaking circles. But despite making an important contribution to development theory and deepening our understanding of North–South development differentials, this strand of analysis is not without its own set of problems and contradictions. Taking a critical view of NIE literature on colonialism, it is argued that by taking the nation state as the basic unit of analysis and by ignoring global power asymmetries, the NIE approach absolves the role of capitalist imperialism in creating global inequalities, and instead produces an internalist and Eurocentric theory of development.||Rahul A Sirohi

It looks at the new kinds of networks forged between culture industries, the ideological state apparatus, a transformed civil society, corporate agendas, and individual actors in evolving newer forms of surveillance and punishment of bodies marginalised by gender and sexuality. The aporia of Kerala’s modernity that results in certain retrograde tendencies is most evident in its cinematic discourses, especially those built around its current investment in male superstardom.||Meena T Pillai

However, the possibility of legal challenge; absence of victim and witness protection, compensation and rehabilitation; and lack of a mechanism to deal with inter-caste and outlier community cases may limit the realisation of the desired goals. Further, by pegging the role of caste panchayats only to social boycott it conveniently excludes the “evolved” upper caste panchayats.||Anagha Ingole

The urban poor, slum dwellers, and migrants are dispossessed as a result of urban restructuring and gentrification.

Addressing theories that have tied the depth of democracy to the quality and effectiveness of citizenship, we develop an index of citizenship and then explore the extent to which citizenship determines the quality of services and infrastructure that households enjoy. Findings show that citizenship and access to services in Bengaluru are highly differentiated, that much of what drives these differences has to do with class, but there is clear evidence that the urban poor are somewhat better in terms of the services they receive than they would be without citizenship. Citizenship, in other words, abates the effects of class.||Ebony Bertorelli,Patrick Heller,Siddharth Swaminathan,Ashutosh Varshney

There is a corresponding increase in the share of land under tenancy, specifically pure tenants.

Thousands of islanders have lost their homes as well as agricultural lands, and many of them have become migrants in their own land. There have been no compensations from the National Disaster Response Fund or the State Disaster Response Fund as the guidelines of the NDRF and SDRF do not consider riverbank erosion as a natural disaster. This article argues for a more rational classification of hazards based on their causation factors.||Avijit Sahay
03-08-2017||perspectives||---------||Treatment Gap in Mental Healthcare : Reflections from Policy and Research||There is a wide treatment gap in Indian mental healthcare. This article discusses the treatment gap and the contributing factors, and suggests ways to reduce it. The political (policy perspective), social (stigma, discrimination, and gender), cultural (beliefs, explanations, and help-seeking behaviours), and economic (direct and indirect costs of treatment) factors addressed have long impeded mental healthcare. A policy and research review reflects that mental illness in India contributes significantly to the global occurrence of mental illness. The treatment gap causes substantial losses to individuals, families, society, and the nation. Innovation and capacity building are necessary to develop and implement locally relevant, feasible, and effective community-based mental healthcare models.||

03-08-2017||review of environment and development||---------||Governance of Waste||Well-versed in the production of waste, corporate capital has not generally focused on capitalising on waste. The discards of consumption, previously approached broadly as mere waste, have recently found rebirth in an increasingly corporate waste market in India. Ranging from contracts for waste collection and incineration-plant installation to sales of recyclables, formal businesses are entering the business of revaluing waste, often to the detriment of India’s already existing informal waste sector that has long conducted its own waste-based businesses. This new, increasingly corporate, business of waste is intimately connected to a new waste governance regime in India. Concerns regarding two symbolically significant waste streams, municipal solid waste and electronic waste, illuminate waste beyond its “management,” and demonstrate its embeddedness in matters of consumerism, informal-sector livelihoods, and urban ecology.||Vinay Gidwani,Julia Corwin
02-08-2017||review of environment and development||---------||Why Do Institutions Shy Away from Action?||Coastal zone management authorities—which were created for the implementation of Coastal Regulation Zone notifications to regulate the use of space for the entire coastline of India at the state level—are relinquishing their powers. Across coastal states, a particular diffidence is seen in taking cognisance of CRZ violations and addressing them. First, when does an institution refuse to use the powers assigned to it? Is it when the powers to enforce are not balanced by protection to them? Or is it when there is a lack of political will? Second, are the instances of inaction borne out of a fear of backlash or a sheer lack of leadership amongst the members to take bold decisions? The paper concludes with identifying a few of the factors that can make the institutions act.||Meenakshi Kapoor
02-08-2017||review of environment and development||---------||The Industrial Project and Organised Labour||This paper looks at the responses of organised labour to the “development” project exemplified by the steel plant, the big dam and the power plant. More precisely, it analyses the presence (or not) of an ecological critique in trade union/labour responses to industrial projects. The paper explores theoretical connections between class-based politics and ecological questions. It delineates some of the specific processes and conditions which can facilitate the entry of ecological issues into the imaginations of a trade union, using the experiences of the Chhattisgarh Mukti Morcha in central India in the process. It argues that “class consciousness” is hardly a deterrent for an engagement with ecology, if one adequately understands the definitions of “class,” labour and production. In India’s specific context, the coming together of the concerns and imaginations of the industrial worker and the Adivasi peasant/farmer can facilitate this conversation between “red” and “green” imaginations.||Radhika Krishnan
02-08-2017||review of environment and development||---------||The Forest Rights Act : Political Economy of ‘Environmental’ Questions||The Forest Rights Act represented a historic step forward for forest management in India, and it is often hailed as such. However, it did not emerge from struggles for the control over forests alone, but was a product of an ongoing intersection between political conflict, features of Indian capitalism, and the conceptions of “environment” and “development” in India’s political discourse. In that sense, it is not only an “environmental” legislation, but an economic and social one, and one that belongs to a particular political conjuncture, representing both its limitations, and more importantly, its liberatory possibilities. This paper looks at the FRA in this context and explores how it grew out of this kind of politics, being marked both by the constraints of this period, and by the spaces it created for genuinely new conceptions and processes of development.||Shankar Gopalakrishnan
02-08-2017||review of environment and development||---------||The Task of the Climate Translator||Climate translations or stories must move between different registers to imaginatively engage with and express life in the Anthropocene. They must give visible form to the diverse climate imaginaries that proliferate in the world. These stories, however, remain unexamined. Following Walter Benjamin, translation is here conceptualised as a movement across domains wherein the translated version need not literally adhere to the original, but should rather aim to carry its echo. An instance of the form potential climate translations might assume is provided through an ethnographic account of human–animal relations in the Indian Himalaya. It compares and contrasts mainstream scientific accounts of animal endangerment/extinction and conflict to embedded but distinct Himalayan stories of multispecies relationality. These seemingly different accounts share a recognisably similar consciousness of human impact, inter-species entanglements, and climatic change.||Nayanika Mathur

Public sector bank credit-financed investments, particularly in the infrastructure sector, played a significant role in sustaining growth, most crucially after the global economic crisis. Such a growth trajectory, however, proved to be unsustainable with the expansionary phase coming to an end in 2011–12 and bad loans piling up in the banking system.||Rohit Azad,Prasenjit Bose,Zico Dasgupta

04-08-2017||special articles||---------||From Groundwater Regulation to Integrated Water Management : The Biophysical Case||Groundwater over-exploitation poses a severe threat to food, water and livelihood security in India, but the approach to groundwater regulation has been guided by the simplistic prescription that to achieve sustainable use, pumping must be less than recharge. This article explains the hydrological cycle and the close relationship between groundwater and surface water, and argues that the conventional notion of sustainable groundwater use is fundamentally flawed. Groundwater, soil moisture and surface water are part of a single integrated resource, and cannot be regulated independent of each other. The solution is not sustainable use or the compartmentalisation of surface and groundwater but the fair and transparent reallocation of renewable freshwater resources.||Veena Srinivasan,Sharachchandra Lele

It misses the complex ways in which the British were actively engaged in fashioning what is now considered “national heritage.”||Gagan Preet Singh

Not only do their employers virtually treat them like slaves but the police and lawyers also take advantage of their helplessness and ignorance to foist false charges and fleece them of their hard-earned money. In this particular incident, a union minister who is also the local MP gave the entire incident a communal colour by insinuating that hard-pressed employers were forced to employ “Bangladeshis” in their homes.||Maya John

In recent years, the cost of solar and wind energy has fallen dramatically. The focus on peak oil supply has been replaced by peak oil demand. The end of the coal era has already begun. DNEP’s energy mix does not reflect these developments. Hence, NITI Aayog should redo its draft energy policy with a well-developed road map.||Bhamy V Shenoy

On the contrary, the UN—wittingly or unwittingly—became a victim of a series of con games played by the nuclear weapon states. On the face of it, the latest attempt of the UN to adopt a so-called Convention on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons appears to be no different. India’s decision to stay away from the proceedings is shocking since it has historically supported the cause of disarmament.||N D Jayaprakash
27-07-2017||special articles||---------||Inequality in India–I||Examining the course of inequality in terms of average per capita expenditure, it is seen that the period after the reforms were initiated registered a dramatic increase in the relative growth of welfare in the top expenditure group, even as the poorest group progressed at a rate higher than the mean. The dip in the middle of the distribution disappeared later when a “ladder” pattern of growth was observed, with each quintile group showing a higher growth rate than the preceding one. The major reasons for this changing pattern are discussed in terms of the structure of growth in the Indian economy, particularly what happened in the tertiary and manufacturing sectors. The paper is being published in two parts. Part II will appear in the issue of 12 August.||Dipak Mazumdar,Sandip Sarkar,Balwant Singh Mehta

But before this judicial failure, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had already politicised the disaster to protect his economic modernisation programme. Recognising the threat the Bhopal tragedy posed to the ideology behind this agenda, Rajiv Gandhi and his advisers pursued multiple strategies to suppress the gas leak’s resonance in larger political debates. This laid the groundwork for the courts’ later miscarriage of justice and helped shape the disaster’s subsequent place in Indian economic history.||Adam B Lerner

It is particularly significant in countries like India where literacy levels are low and where memories of the oppressed are routinely erased from public memory. This article questions the presumed superiority of the written over the oral. It presents a critique of “establishment” historiography and suggests that historians should adopt a receptive and balanced approach to different forms of history. Oral history reorients the historian’s craft in interesting ways. The oral history method is crucial for capturing histories that flourish outside the dominant narratives of modern societies.||Anirudh Deshpande
21-07-2017||special articles||---------||Indian Business Groups and Their Dominance in the Indian Economy||Business groups have played an important role in the development of the Indian economy by filling the institutional voids arising from weak markets and institutions. As these economic institutions developed, the need for business groups was expected to reduce. There does exist a reducing trend, but at the same time, average size and average sales of business group firms are increasing. This anomaly raises a question. Are all business groups losing their importance or is it only a few of them? Our results demonstrate that expectation of diminishing importance does not hold true for top group firms. We show that top group firms have been able to capture appropriate growth drivers resulting in economic dominance and concentration of economic power.||Aditya Mohan Jadhav,V Nagi Reddy

Within contemporary academic discourse, thus, there remains a major question concerning the issue of institutionalising the non-marketable customary collective rights of local communities to address the asymmetrical power relationships in natural resource distribution conflicts. Against this backdrop, a study conducted in the Sundarban forest region of West Bengal explores the community-based natural resource management paradigm and how customary rights of the local communities have fared under the joint forest management programme. It examines the applicability, as well as the successes and limitations of the programme as an alternative to state-led top-down models of conservation, and the impact of political and economic control over people and resources.||Amrita Sen,Sarmistha Pattanaik

Or is the junk food intake of adolescents related to the educational status of both parents in a transitioning economy, where education can directly or indirectly influence imitation of so-called Western-style fast food consumption patterns? This analysis of survey data from a non-metropolitan Indian setting shows that junk food intake of adolescents is actually lower for working mothers than for homemakers, decreases with an increase in the mother’s education, but increases with increase in the father’s education and with the household’s socio-economic status.||Arzi Adbi,Nafis Faizi,Chirantan Chatterjee

To do this, the paper identifies three distinct phases of development in the gold mining industry of this region that mark and encompass shifts in governance of the area, global economic trends, commercial investment, property rights, government funding, influx of repatriate communities, and other social issues in the local economy. The analysis concludes that institutions in the region have evolved from formal–artisanal to formal–industrial, and then to informal–small scale.||Amalendu Jyotishi,Sashi Sivramkrishna,Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt

These are quite critical in understanding the theoretical underpinnings of the process through which mining activities tend to completely transform the landscape of Chhattisgarh. By using Karl Polanyi’s thesis of double movement and the theory of primitive accumulation by Karl Marx, this study delves into contemporary processes of grabbing land and forced displacements in Chhattisgarh. Commodification of land has affected not only the livelihoods of local communities in Chhattisgarh, but has also disrupted sociocultural harmony. Our study elaborates on the cultural vacuum—to use Polanyi’s term—that is created once an individual is displaced from her/his social settings and traditional institutions.||Kamei Aphun,Jay Prakash Sharma

Between 2011–12 and 2015–16, the last year for which official financial results are available, the airline showed a steady improvement in terms of its operational profit/loss as well as its passenger load factor.

Schemes aiming to promote contributions from the poor unorganised workers for their old age security have been promoted by the government since 2010. By comparing and contrasting the design features of India’s two contributory pension schemes, National Pension System Lite and Atal Pension Yojana, and discussing the strengths and limitations of each of these schemes in addressing the needs of low-income workers with the help of available data and studies, we argue that the design features of these schemes are such that they fail to take the specific characteristics of unorganised worker households into account.

A careful reading of this largely public relations spin on existing plans suggests that it chiefly hopes to persuade the Nuclear Suppliers Group to accept India as a member and attract capital that aims to profit from supplying components for nuclear power plants.

However, the practices of indigenous communities as well as the insights of ecological studies point to the importance of using fire in controlled ways to manage dry and deciduous forest ecosystems.||Tarsh Thekaekara,Abi Tamim Vanak,Ankila J Hiremath,Nitin D Rai,Jayashree Ratnam,Raman Sukumar

However, the multi-stakeholder ecosystem of forests requires a multilayered governance framework in which the regulatory, funding and operational roles are separated and democratised. This will help resolve the prevailing tension and confusion regarding forest governance in the post-FRA era.||Sharachchandra Lele

30-06-2017||special articles||---------||A Bittersweet Moment : Indian Governance Feminism and the 2013 Rape Law Reforms||Based on a mapping of Indian feminist interventions on the law of rape over the past three decades, culminating in the wide-ranging law reforms following the rape and murder of Jyoti Singh Pandey in December 2012, it is argued that Indian feminism displays key characteristics of governance feminism. In particular, Indian governance feminism is deeply committed to a highly gendered understanding of sexual violence. Further, Indian feminism has increasingly resorted to the use of the criminal law to address sexual violence even as its historical suspicion of postcolonial state power has reduced considerably and is now mostly evident in its opposition to the death penalty for rapists. A robust culture of state feminism has ensured that feminist ideas find a foothold in state institutions and indeed state laws. It is hoped that by demystifying feminists’ roles in law reform processes, we can begin to assess the intended and unintended consequences of such influence and resultant legislative successes.||Prabha Kotiswaran
30-06-2017||special articles||---------||Do Producers Gain from Selling Milk? : An Economic Assessment of Dairy Farming in Contemporary India||Primary field-level information collected shows that producing milk for sale is not always profitable and suggests that despite the white revolution, milk production still remains largely a subsistence activity. There are, however, large variations in milk price, animal stock, and profit among regions; urbanisation levels of districts; and main occupations of producers. The results also reveal that the producer’s remuneration varies with the uses of different marketing channels. While informal traders still dominate the market, the sign of entry of private corporate buyers is also clear. The findings raise serious concerns about the commercial prospects of dairy farmers, especially in the eastern region and among the labouring classes and others who practise dairy as a subsidiary economic activity.||Nilabja Ghosh,Amarnath Tripathi,M Rajeshwor,Roopal Singh

For within-state inequality, this article is the first to use a “nightlights” luminosity data set as a proxy for gross domestic product per capita, whereas the choice of a crisper data set, comprising the 12 largest states, yields sharper results than in previous literature. It concludes with a cautionary note on the goods and services tax, which, contrary to the optimists, is likely to further exacerbate, rather than ameliorate, regional income disparities, marking the need for a turn to “place-based” economic policies.||Praveen Chakravarty,Vivek Dehejia

The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, one among the farmers’ movements of the 1980s, became a member of a transnational agrarian movement, La Via Campesina in 1996 to confront issues that were “global” in nature. Based on ethnography during 2011−12 and focusing on the linkages of the KRRS with LVC, the simultaneity of different processes at play within the KRRS are explored to shed light upon how shared understandings are intertwined with the perception and practice of politics, the multiple meanings attached to the terms “local” and “global,” and the discourses and practices of alternative agriculture.||Niloshree Bhattacharya
30-06-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||Farm Power Policies and Groundwater Markets : Contrasting Gujarat with West Bengal (1990–2015)||With India emerging as the world’s largest groundwater irrigator, marginal farmers and tenants in many parts have come to depend on informal water markets for irrigation. Power subsidies have grown these markets and made them pro-poor, but are also responsible for groundwater depletion, and for financial troubles of electricity distribution companies of India or DISCOMs. Gujarat has successfully reduced subsidies by rationing farm power supply, and West Bengal has done so by charging farmers commercial power tariff on metered consumption. Subsidy reforms have hit poor farmers and tenants hard in both the states. Gujarat has tried to support the poor, with some success, by prioritising them in allocating new tube well connections. We argue that West Bengal too can support its poor by tweaking its farm power pricing formula to turn a sellers’ water market into a buyers’ one.||Tushaar Shah,Sujata Das Chowdhury

The results show that disadvantages originating in caste-based discrimination make socially marginalised groups in agriculture end up with low access to resources, low levels of productivity, and low realisation of returns.||Shankar Rao
30-06-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||Declassification of Census Towns in West Bengal||Eighty-one new census towns in West Bengal are on the verge of declassification in the 2021 Census. This must not be understood to mean that non-farm workers are moving into farm activities. Rather, evidences suggest that growth of farm employment has simply outpaced that of non-farm employment in these new census towns and is possibly the reason behind their imminent declassification. The case of Patuli, which is only considered as an example, shows that non-farm activities, especially trading, are witnessing a fall-off phase and that it failed to expand owing to the loss of its market town/rural service centre character over time, goaded by some local factors. This has led to the subsequent inability to generate sufficient full-time jobs at Patuli. More studies are required to build a comprehensive outlook on the policy measures required to preserve the role of these new census towns as market towns and/or rural service centres in the future.||Saurav Chakraborty,Subhanil Chowdhury,Utpal Roy,Kakoli Das

Both these settlements—a census town and a gram panchayat— have a sizeable working population employed in a variety of non-farm occupations. The different types of non-farm activities in these locations are catalogued while examining the dynamics of caste, community and gender within the social organisation of the non-farm economy. The persistence of social hierarchies, differential incomes and discriminatory practices within the emergent non-farm economy are highlighted, even as the “traditional” jajmani-type social structure has nearly completely disintegrated.||Surinder S Jodhka,Adarsh Kumar

Millions of pieces of data available on the past (1961–2007) and on a plausible future (2006–50 projections by the Food and Agriculture Organization) are organised in a simple world food model where production, trade and consumption are aggregated and balanced in calories. Given the current and/or future land–labour relationships that characterise India and Africa, can these regions experience the same structural transformation that the developed countries went through, or work together towards a new sociotechnical regime by developing their own regionally differentiated labour-intensive production investments and technological capacities for economic, social, and ecological sustainability?||Bruno Dorin

In this context, Australia’s experience with price monitoring and control during the GST transition period is looked at to draw lessons for India. It is eminently possible to institute a comprehensive and effective price monitoring and control mechanism in India to enable benefits to consumers under the GST regime. However, the anti-profiteering rules in their present form have some lacunae and may not produce the desired results of containing profits and, thereby, price rise.||

The data suggests a sharp slowdown in the remonetisation process in mid-December 2016, which reached only 80% of what was demonetised by the end of April.

We subject this particular paper to critical scrutiny and find that the Bank’s poverty enumeration exercise fails to satisfy the requirements of transparency, denies researchers access to data, and replicability of the poverty numbers produced by the Bank. We have provided evidence of non-robustness of the poverty estimates by using different purchasing power parities. A simpler method for estimating PPPs that avoids the complex and expensive procedure adopted by the World Bank-led International Comparison Program has also been proposed.||Amita Majumder,Ranjan Ray,Sattwik Santra

Establishing a Parliamentary Budget Office, an independent and impartial body linked directly to Parliament, is a fitting response to this concern.||Vinod Bhanu,Ravi Duggal,Cara Aquilina

08-06-2017||special articles||---------||Breaking the Chaturvarna System of Languages||The Indian language policy is informed by a pull towards unilingual identity, inspired by the European model of nation state that is predicated on the homogeneity of its people. Language hegemony works at two tiers in India—at the state and the centre. The Constitution fails to pay more than lip service to the linguistic plurality and multilingual ethos of the peoples of India and has created a chaturvarna (four-tier order) of languages, with Sanskrit, Hindi, the scheduled, and the non-scheduled languages occupying various rungs of the ladder. English—the language of the conquerors—being outside the chaturvarna system has emancipatory potential.||

This article outlines an approach to “empowering” women municipal councillors by expanding their possibilities for “self-becoming.” Drawing upon empirical research on the lived experiences of women parshads (municipal councillors) in Dehradun, Uttarakhand, it suggests a series of interventions that correspond to particular needs and opportunities at different stages of their term. Theories of social change and the literature on adult pedagogy further inform the design of effective learning opportunities.||Tanya Jakimow
09-06-2017||special articles||---------||Autopic Imperial Eyes : Intersecting Race and Language in Early Cross-cultural Encounters||Ideological and social practices are interconnected and politically constitute each other. This article takes an interdisciplinary approach to investigate how historians and literary scholars have discussed the intersections of exploration, colonisation, language and race during early European imperial expeditions. It examines the construction of racial “otherness,” in terms of religion, and community; through early European explorations and through the lens of gender. It also underscores the role of language as a tool for imperial domination and assesses the idea of linguistic colonialism by situating Shakespeare as a translator of the racial divide and scrutinising his representations of characters in two of his most popular dramas The Tempest and Othello.||Sudipa Topdar

This growth, though largely in the lower middle class category, happened across a majority of states in both rural and urban areas. Structurally, the new middle class is quite different from the conventional understanding of it. Although dominated by upper castes, other caste groups too have entered the new middle class in large numbers. The occupational structure within the class is heterogeneous. The lower middle class is engaged in occupations similar to that of the poor, whereas the upper middle class is involved in traditional service activities as well as in new knowledge services.||Sandhya Krishnan,Neeraj Hatekar

It seeks to explore how women manage such behaviour meted out to them, what kind of policies and processes do organisations have for protecting them from being sexually harmed, and whether the enactment of a law is adequ ate in safeguarding their interest and reputation. It also draws attention to practices instituted by some organisations that are proactive and gender sensitive.||

This survey of Tiruppur and Ludhiana reveals that credibility is more important than community. Factory workers could become owners in Ludhiana, and non-Gounders—who are part of the cotton knitwear production in Tiruppur and persons outside Ludhiana’s merchant community—could start micro factories as subcontractors. Vertical cooperation is functioning across communities in both places. The social networks did not exclude other communities. Easy entry has provided opportunities to young people to start business in both clusters. The social networks function beyond community and caste.||Shuji Uchikawa

The focus is on how communist ideology for a casteless and classless society translated into the humaneness of revolutionary subjectivity, creating relations of intimacy between the guerrilla armies and the people in its strongholds. Crucially, also analysed are a series of contradictions that constantly undermine revolutionary mobilisation, tearing the Naxalites apart and destroying them from within.||Alpa Shah

It might make those in power feel less insecure, but eventually such a strategy will have disastrous effects, whenthose who have been alienated, exploited and displaced take up arms against the state.

11-05-2017||tagore's social praxis||---------||Rabindranath Tagore’s Theology of Work||Taking the distinctive meaning of intimacy as its starting point, this paper explores Rabindranath Tagore’s notion of the relational self and the commitment to work. The idea of work as connecting relationships that make up the world, is something that is derived from neo-Vedantic conceptions that privilege the concerns of this world. Institutionally, this translates into various forms of cooperation of which cooperatives are the primary mode. The paper concludes with some of the dilemmas of Rabindranath’s conception of praxis that go beyond a measurement of success and failure.||Pradip Kumar Datta
11-05-2017||tagore's social praxis||---------||Tagore on Modernity, Nationalism and ‘the Surplus in Man’||Rabindranath Tagore’s reflections on the concepts and practices of civilisation, nationalism, and community are directly concerned with the nature of modern political power and its underlying assumptions about human life. This article interprets these reflections by reading them along with and in the light of his philosophical anthropology as articulated in a variety of philosophical essays, focusing closely on The Religion of Man. It concludes by underscoring the contemporary import of these reflections as a philosophical resource for thinking about possibilities of human communities that go beyond the way the dominant tendency in political power tends to capture human life under its multiple regimes.||Mohinder Singh
11-05-2017||tagore's social praxis||---------||Sriniketan Encounters Ambedkar : Whither the Political?||Building on Tagore’s critique of “politics,” an English term Tagore does not translate into rajneeti (thus retaining its foreignness), the paper moves to Tagore’s turning away from nationalism as largely an “abstract being” or a symbolic form, and his turning, instead, to the question of dharma (as the dialectic between askesis, a la Foucault, and phronesis, a la Heidegger). Dharma as the this-worldly art-praxis of attending to what the abstract being or the symbolic form forecloses. For Tagore, Sriniketan is the context for such an art-praxis. For the authors, Ambedkar is the imaginary interlocutor of Tagore’s redrawing of the extant practice of the political.||Anup Dhar,Anjan Chakrabarti
11-05-2017||tagore's social praxis||---------||Cultivating a Taste for Nature : Tagore’s Landscape Paintings||Rabindranath Tagore began to paint independent paintings, freed from an origin in text, only in 1928. Many of these were landscapes and painterly engagements with seasons. Earlier however, in 1923, Tagore began his experiments in rural regeneration with an elaborate “Masque” performance in Surul, a small rural settlement close to the fledgling Visva-Bharati University project, to bring “hill tribes” into the ambit of agricultural work and reshape the land which until then had “never known the scratch of a ploughshare.” This paper attempts to offer a reading of the ideological drive through which a public attitude towards the surrounding landscape was shaped by Tagore’s performances and how his shift to landscape painting was one way of registering the continuity of human experiences across space and time.||Shukla V Sawant

These varied trajectories, including responses to the “cultural tours,” raise fresh questions in our times.||Rimli Bhattacharya
11-05-2017||tagore's social praxis||---------||Rabindranath Tagore and the Democracy of Our Times||Capital is not simply an additive to the Foucauldian conception of power, but is integral to it. Karl Marx’s analysis of the worker shows the operations of biopower in the factory, in the governmental fashioning of the internal motivations of the worker that complements the disciplinary regime of the factory. While Marxist analysis holds out prospects of liberation, it remains too preoccupied with the state. In this context, Rabindranath Tagore is a figure who not only refuses to compromise with the totalising force of governmental power as manifested in colonialism (especially its education policy), but also identifies in cooperation, a social principle that holds out the possibility of freedom from capitalist power knowledge.

The processes examined include regulations related to coal-fired thermal power plants and water. The Indian process is ad hoc, opaque, and has limited scope for public participation. This can lead to inappropriate standards, lack of legitimacy of standards, and absence of widespread acceptance, all leading to ineffective implementation.

Compared to the major caste groups (Brahmins, other forward castes, existing OBCs, and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) in their respective states, based on several socio-economic factors, they are closer to dominant than disadvantaged groups. Their claim to backwardness is empirically unjustified. The paper examines the material basis of their anxieties in the context of structural changes in the Indian agricultural economy. It investigates networks and political connections that explain their success in mobilising.||Ashwini Deshpande,Rajesh Ramachandran

Years of structural reform and policy changes have had an effect on both the costs and tariffs of electric power. Electricity supply involves both the central and state governments, and given the diversity of geographical conditions, the experience of different states in pricing and cost recovery has been different over the years. The focus of this paper is on how costs and tariffs have evolved for 22 major Indian states from 1975 to 2010, and it attempts to correlate that with policy changes||Muralee Krishnan C,Santanu Gupta

However, in cases where the regulators have confidential information about the entities under them, releasing such information in the public domain can be a complicated issue.

Contrary to previous research on the fate of erstwhile hegemonic parties, which has emphasised the importance of pragmatism in reviving defeated hegemonic parties, it is argued that the case of West Bengal illustrates a different dynamic. Specifically, it was too much pragmatism, not less, that led to the LF’s rapid demise. The coalition’s inability to pursue a programmatic strategy of industrialisation to tackle West Bengal’s agrarian crisis resulted in massive preference falsification among voters, and subsequently, a swift electoral decline.||Subhasish Ray

The narrative highlights the change from a narrow understanding of science and a career within it, to the emerging multiple possibilities of being a person in science—a change made possible because the feminist lens shifts focus from the question of women in science to a feminist understanding of science. The process, hence, results in a slow inhabiting of the “outsider” in a reimagined landscape of the discipline.||

I reflect on the larger problems women in physics find themselves up against and which range from fewer numbers of women in these areas of science, to integration of women into peer groups, widely prevalent sexist attitudes in their workspaces, lack of support facilities like childcare, and sexual harassment in the workplace. In spite of more women finding jobs in physics in recent years, the attitudinal shifts required to make a genuine difference in the culture of research have not yet fallen into place. Issues of discrimination, whether due to gender, race or caste, prevalent in science have to do with institutional structures and the culture of research. However, the “hard” sciences like physics deal with immutable, objective knowledge, which is itself not marked by these human discriminants.||Sumathi Rao

It details the experiences that allowed her to go beyond the disciplinary confines to engage with feminist and caste politics. Two, it describes and problematises, even if in a limited way, how mathematics and science research institutions are organised and function, the dominant notions and beliefs that operate in these spaces, and their implication for the larger academic atmosphere in the country. It throws light on the pervasive notions of merit that operate in the science institutions, contributing to the exclusion of women and those from marginalised castes.||Jayasree Subramanian

The aim is to look beyond the lack of numbers when we consider women in science and to examine the myriad layers that are a part of any such reflection. Maybe, coming from a particular caste background aided in becoming a mathematician, but being from the South in North India created another set of problems. Mathematics, however, was the safe haven within which much of this played out, or was it?||Geetha Venkataraman

Not only do they have to struggle much more than their male counterparts, but women mathematicians who have made important contributions are still not given their due. The problems that women in the natural sciences face and the possible ways in which these can be addressed in order to create a more equitable work atmosphere in science research institutions and universities is discussed.||
26-04-2017||review of women's studies||---------||The Production of Science : Bearing Gender, Caste and More||The discourse on gender and science in India remains largely oblivious of the ways in which caste and class shape the gender experience of those who do science, and operate with gender to shape the project of science itself. There are many ways in which science and the process of producing it are gendered and bear caste that are detrimental to the very project of doing “good” science in India. A collaboration between three scientists with differing caste, gender and nationality locations— one addresses the issue as a Scheduled Tribe student from one of the states in North East India, another addresses the structures of caste and gender as a Scheduled Caste student from Hyderabad, and a third addresses the same as a dominant caste genderqueer transgender professor—their experiences of science are shaped in multiple contexts in this article.||

It looks at different scenarios such as a deferred offer, alternate offer, revised offer that the offer letter can be a precursor to. It also argues that from the organisation’s perspective these are risk management strategies in the face of various circumstances. Different kinds of misrepresentation on the part of employer and employees to induce each other to enter into an employment agreement are deliberated upon. The role of labour market intermediaries in perpetrating this is also highlighted. Further, it suggests steps that can be taken to mitigate such instances and grounds under which damages may be claimed upon subsequent knowledge.||S Senthil Ganesh,Mousumi Padhi

This study, however, suggests that health insurance has been unsuccessful in protecting households from poverty and impoverishment resulting from out-of-pocket payments, and that insurance in fact subverts the effectiveness of the traditional health financing system. Free or low-cost healthcare provisioning by the state remains the best way to enhance the health and well-being of households, provided the inadequacies and inequalities across districts are addressed, and low-cost medicines and diagnostics made available to all.||Shailender Kumar Hooda

It is also a place of excellence, not as conveyed by ranking systems, but by the value its research holds for its peers across the world.||

The crucial difference between the BJP and other parties is that it is able to instil a sense of destiny not just among its rank and file but also the general public and convince it that the party is doing desh seva while others have been doing only politics.||Suhas Palshikar

It represented a distinct imagination about the region and emerged as a literary imaginary in the late 16th century and over the early part of the 17th century, entering into the imperial chronicles. By the mid-17th century, the concept had become a part of the political discourse and the language of Mughal sovereignty. The literary and political imaginary of Kashmir in the Mughal court drew upon older textual traditions like the literature and histories from Kashmir, corpora of Arab and Persian geographies compiled from the ninth century onwards, travel accounts, wonder tales and the chronicles of the Ghaznavid and Timurid courts.||Anubhuti Maurya

They are about the continued making and maintenance of kinship ties across transnational family networks over the changing practices of border control. Officers and constables in the Indian Border Security Force, tasked with preventing all cross-border movements, recognised with sympathy the existence and emotional power of cross-border family ties. This article attempts to answer questions like what normative and emotive ideas about kin obligations and morality prevail upon individuals and families as they decide whether or not to continue investment in relations across borders. How do these sit within the larger political economy of the border itself?||Sahana Ghosh
13-04-2017||exploring borderlands in south asia||---------||Reading Parijat and B P Koirala : Belonging and Borders in 20th Century Nepali Novels||This article suggests a feminist reading of borders and nation in investigating the poetics of transborder humanism scattered in the popular genre of Nepali fiction and poetry. While border-crossing is predominantly associated with suffering and despair as well as hope and relief, it may also allude to opportunism and betrayal. My argument is that borders are not only corporeal and political, but also introspective and personal. I reflect on the works of Parijat and B P Koirala whose lives criss-crossed the Nepal–India border on more than one level. I argue that the conundrum of their political and personal engagements might have triggered a new poetic discourse on an individual’s relationship with society, state and the world. This genre of writing speaks to an earlier South Asian discourse dating back to Tagore but more recently, revisited in its psychoanalytic interpretations by Ashis Nandy which interpret borders and nationalism more flexibly to offer an alternative that is different from its more mainstream, Westphalian theorisations.||Mallika Shakya

In the context of the phrases like “pacification” and “tranquilisation” of frontiers used as mentioned in the British reports, which suggest a state of constant turmoil, this study finds answers to the questions such as: (i) Could banditry in the arid Thar merely be understood through a criminal context, or was it located in a political context of power? (ii) Were the native rulers incapable of suppressing banditry or were their negotiations with bandits a part of historical system of exchange? (iii) Did banditry and the rebelliousness that it was inextricably located in, challenge the ideas about Rajputhood and warriorhood, as they had emerged in the Rajput courts? (iv) Did banditry constitute dissidence, as a number of bandits were outlaws?||Tanuja Kothiyal
13-04-2017||exploring borderlands in south asia||---------||Borderlands, Empires and Nations : Himalayan and Trans-Himalayan Borderlands (c 1815–1930)||In the first decade of the 19th century, Kumaun was part of the Gorkha Empire connected to Kathmandu by a well-serviced east–west road. Trade in grain and salt by shepherding communities linked it to Western Tibet. In 1815, when Kumaun became a part of the East India Company’s territories, this orientation changed. Gradually, a network of roads and railways transformed the hitherto impenetrable Tarai, to the south of Kumaun. As the Kumaun economy integrated with the British Empire, via the Tarai, the commodity composition of its trade with Western Nepal (Nepal borderland) and Western Tibet (Tibet borderland) was modified. The subsequent mapping of these territories by the British created not only new geographies but also engendered new ways of knowing. The interaction of imperial administrators with the people of the borderlands produced narratives, which ignored earlier cultural identities and generated new histories of groups like the “Gorkha” and “Bhotia.”||Vasudha Pande
13-04-2017||exploring borderlands in south asia||---------||Bureaucracy and Border Control : Crime, Police Reform and National Security in Kutch, 1948–52||Studies on militarisation and borders in South Asia have often remained focused on zones of spectacular conflict such as Kashmir, or Punjab during the partition. This article tracks the production of a discourse on borders by those charged with border security such as the police and other senior bureaucracy in the decades following the partition. It suggests that the “border question” evolved gradually out of a series of everyday concerns over local criminality that finally coalesced into the more abstract category of “national security.” It examines bureaucratic debates on police reorganisation in Kutch between 1948 and 1952 to suggest that contemporary discourses on nation and borders were arrived at through intra-bureaucratic negotiations with the far less abstract categories of village, locality and region.||Farhana Ibrahim
13-04-2017||exploring borderlands in south asia||---------||Embattled Frontiers and Emerging Spaces : Transformation of the Tawang Border||In the years following the India–China War (1962), Tawang underwent a significant makeover. In 1964, the Indian government sanctioned the construction of the Nehru Gompa monastery to commemorate Jawaharlal Nehru’s visit to Tawang. Nehru Gompa is a symbol of the new relations between the Indian state and the Tibetan Buddhist institutions that were forged in the early postcolonial period in India’s North East Frontier. This paper looks at the changing dynamics between the Tawang Monastery, the local population, and the state in this context, and focuses on how the Tawang Monastery negotiated with the local administration through the medium of official correspondence.||Swargajyoti Gohain

The Ambedkarite critique of Gandhi is centred on the latter’s fast unto death in opposition to the MacDonald Award of separate electorates for Dalits. Formalistic readings of Gandhi are not in the interest of the robust, associative and inclusive intellectual tradition at the core of Ambedkar’s emancipatory project. Ambedkar was a pathfinder who chose critique as a method of ethical persuasion to gently pull in and retain members of caste society in the interlocutory framework of conversation.||Gopal Guru

His body of work demonstrates that he formulated a number of concepts to take stock of the social reality that he confronted, and/or reformulated existing concepts by critically engaging with the body of scholarship available to him. With regard to the conception of the political, he advanced a comprehensive and consistent design of what it means to live as a public and how best to do so in a setting very different from the West.||

This article argues that communities in India, based on caste/class structures, refashioned their social–political identities vis-à-vis the war. Never a party to the cause of the war, these communities’ redefinition of their self-identity was part of their desire to carve out a legitimate place in the modern public sphere filled with discourses of martial race, loyalty, discipline and nationalism. The focus is on the contours of the Lingayat community’s imagination and formation of its identity during the war and efforts to occupy a place in the military and political establishment.||Vijayakumar M Boratti

31-03-2017||special articles||---------||Waste-to-Energy and Recycling : Competing Systems of Waste Management in Urban India||Incineration-based waste-to-energy technologies have recently emerged as the preferred policy option for managing the growing problem of waste in India. These technologies require a continuous supply of waste inputs of sufficient quantity and quality—high calorific value and low moisture content—to be viable. Government and industry proponents suggest that WtE and recycling are compatible systems of managing waste while their critics disagree. This article argues two main points. First, the government’s preference for WtE contradicts the empirical evidence, which suggests that the physical, chemical and biological characteristics of Indian waste render it technically unsuitable for incineration. Second, to be viable, WtE technologies will require end-to-end control over the entire waste management chain, thus displacing those in the informal recycling sector from their means of subsistence. Far from being compatible, the two systems are in fact in competition with each other over the same set of material resources.||Aman Luthra

23-03-2017||perspectives||---------||Beyond the Oxymoronic Idea of No-detention Policy||The periodic debates on continuous and comprehensive evaluation and no-detention policy in media are completely futile, given the current class-wise structure of schools and curricula. As a result, elementary education gets defi ned by the number of years spent in school. The examination system thwarts all attempts at bringing reforms in pedagogy, curriculum and textbooks. Therefore, discarding both examinations and detention is necessary, and an alternative imagination of schools and curriculum organisation is imperative for the success of educational reforms.||Rohit Dhankar

24-03-2017||money, banking and finance 2017||---------||Reflections on Analytical Issues in Monetary Policy : The Indian Economic Realities||Analytical issues have arisen in the conduct of flexible inflation targeting as the framework of monetary policy, adopted formally by India in 2016, despite the noticeable downward drift in the inflation rate and concerns of many economists about its relevance in the light of the global financial crisis. Issues such as the framework’s rationale, the medium-term inflation target, the meaning of real interest rate in the Indian context, the realism in respect of inflation expectations and of the inferred logic of the yield curve, and the implications for economic inequalities have been pointed out.||A Vasudevan
24-03-2017||money, banking and finance 2017||---------||Negative Interest Rates||A near-unprecedented turn to negative interest rates to trigger a recovery has characterised the monetary policy in several developed countries and in Europe. This is the result of a shift away from fiscal policy to an almost exclusive reliance on monetary policy, involving quantitative easing and low interest rates, in macroeconomic interventions across the globe. The failure of this macroeconomic stance has led to the phenomenon of negative rates in countries other than the United States, and the first sign of even a partial recovery in that country has been enough to set off a reversal.||C P Chandrasekhar
24-03-2017||money, banking and finance 2017||---------||Vulnerability of Emerging Market Economies to Exogenous Shocks||The transmission of global demand, oil supply and monetary policy shocks on the Indian economy are empirically examined using a parsimonious structural vector autoregression model for the period 1996 to 2016. Global demand shocks exert the most dominant effect causing fluctuations in various macroeconomic variables, whereas global monetary policy spillovers play an important role in affecting domestic short-term interest rates and financial asset prices. Global oil supply shocks, given its relative weightage as an intermediate input, have a greater impact on wholesale price index inflation than on consumer price index inflation. Given the rising trade and financial integration of the Indian economy, a quantitative impact analysis of these global shocks assumes importance for macroeconomic and monetary policy frameworks.||Bhupal Singh,Rajeev Jain
24-03-2017||money, banking and finance 2017||---------||Indian Banking : Perception and Reality||This paper overviews the issues of non-performing assets held by banks; slowdown in credit growth; corporate debt; absence of modern risk-based approaches to management and regulation; the poor record of banks in transmitting monetary policy impulses; and their contributions to financial inclusion. It attempts to show that reality is more nuanced than the standard perspective that blames public ownership or a failure to modernise for the stresses public sector banks face.||Ashima Goyal
24-03-2017||money, banking and finance 2017||---------||Non-performing Assets in Indian Banks : This Time It Is Different||Growing non-performing assets is a recurrent problem in the Indian banking sector. Over the past two decades, there have been two such episodes when the banking sector was severely impaired by balance sheet problems. A comparative analysis of two banking crisis episodes— one in the late 1990s, and another that started in the aftermath of the 2008 Global Financial Crisis and is yet to be resolved—is presented. Taking note of the macroeconomic and banking environment preceding these episodes, and the degree and nature of crises, policy responses undertaken are discussed. Policy lessons are explored with suggestions for measures to adapt to a future balance sheet-related crisis in the banking sector such that the impact on the real economy is minimal.||Rajeswari Sengupta,Harsh vardhan
24-03-2017||money, banking and finance 2017||---------||Were Public Sector Banks Victimised through AQR? : A Strategic Orientation Perspective||An inadvertent consequence of asset quality review by the Reserve Bank of India is that it portrayed public sector banks as inefficient managers of the burgeoning non-performing asset crisis relative to their private sector peers. A study, which used panel data regression to investigate the NPAs of 46 scheduled commercial banks between 2007 and 2016, has explored the myth by adopting a strategic orientation perspective to look into the antecedent periods of high uncertainties and jolts, leading to the build-up of NPAs, the changes in banks’ strategic orientations, and their effects on provisioning and NPA reduction. But no evidence was found to support the myth and to suggest that banks, across ownership, are incrementally exposing their NPAs ex post, subject to provisioning ex ante and that a moderate approach during periods of high uncertainty is most effective in managing NPAs. The study questions the received wisdom regarding the nature of risk-free sovereign debts and their impact on the NPA problem.||Shubhabrata Basu,Moovendhan V
24-03-2017||money, banking and finance 2017||---------||Did MGNREGS Improve Financial Inclusion?||Utilising household-level data, this paper investigates the impact of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme on financial inclusion. Exploiting the staggered timing of the roll-out of the programme across districts, while controlling for its non-random implementation, it is found that MGNREGS improves financial access. This is confirmed in simple univariate tests as well as in multivariate regressions that take into account several district- and household-level controls. The evidence, however, is less compelling when the use of finance is examined, although there is a differential impact for districts with higher proportion of women. The magnitudes in most cases are quite large and suggest that public works programme can positively influence financial inclusion.||Saibal Ghosh
24-03-2017||money, banking and finance 2017||---------||How Efficient Are India’s Cooperative Banks?||In spite of their distinct organisational structure and banking philosophy based on mutuality, there is scant evidence on efficiency of cooperative banks. The efficiency of district central cooperative banks in India is investigated by constructing a panel of 297 cooperative banks over the period 2002–14. Using parametric and non-parametric frontier analysis, it is found that efficiency estimates vary depending upon whether advances or investments of DCCBs are used as output. The efficiency of cooperative banking is mapped, and shows considerable variation in efficiency of DCCBs across states. The findings suggest the need for innovative strategies to improve cooperative banking efficiency in the country.||Sarthak Gaurav,Jisha Krishnan

Taking stock of this development, its impact and implications for new products, processes and services, including for financial inclusion are examined. The Jan Dhan–Aadhaar–mobile phones trinity provides fertile ground for fintech to permeate to the “last mile.” Notwithstanding its manifold benefits, there is a need to exercise caution in areas such as privacy and ownership of data. In a fast-paced world of rapidly evolving technology and related financial services, regulators have new paradigms to grapple with and therefore, need to be proactive so as to not stifle the growth of this nascent sector.||Ajit Ranade

In this paper, the cost of liquidity is measured by computing the bid-ask spreads of liquid securities traded in the Indian government securities market, and is analysed with other liquidity measures. Overall, volatility is found to be the key variable impacting bid-ask spreads. Trading volume has a negative impact on spreads, although at a much smaller magnitude. Trade initiation and net liquidity appear to be smaller but significant drivers of spreads. Order imbalance and trade execution variables, analysed separately with the other variables, show divergent relationship with spreads.||Golaka C Nath,Sahana Rajaram,Priyanka Shiraly,Manoj Dalvi
24-03-2017||money, banking and finance 2017||---------||Long-run Performance of Seasoned Equity Offerings : New Evidence from India||Using data for 518 seasoned equity offerings during 2003 to 2015, it is argued that equity market performance of SEOs declines significantly post issue, compared to peer firms. This is particularly true for SEOs issued during market upswings and more so for follow-on public offers or FPOs where money is raised from external shareholders. Evidence suggests that this declining equity performance is mainly due to the deterioration in operating performance after such an issue. Further, firms with more available free cash flows and greater perceived growth opportunities show higher declines, while larger firms and those with higher pre-existing leverage with more monitoring, register lower declines in performance. Indian firms on average tend to “time” the market, take advantage of information asymmetry to raise SEO money during boom years and mostly engage in value-destroying activities, while a few big-ticket SEOs issued and subscribed during market downturns are the only outliers to this generally gloomy performance scenario.||Soumya G Deb

But in transforming Indian society to ensure a better future for the Indian people, radical politics must preserve the kernel of the liberal–political tradition in the process of transcending that heritage.

The dominance of the futures market over options has diminished after the increase in the Security Transaction Tax. It is proposed that the STT on protective put and hedged call positions should be reduced to give a boost to the options market. Whether introduction of financial derivatives led to better price discovery in India is explored.

That particular intellectual initiative simultaneously places the BJP in a position of immense advantage and ensures that “anti-BJP” would necessarily be equated with the anti-national! Independently, both ideas—Hindutva and development—are potent political discourses. By weaving them together with nationalism Narendra Modi has bound them into an arsenal of his political offensive. Therefore, the coming times would be less about electoral victories and more about the onward march of this hegemony in the realm of popular imagination; about how democracy shapes up in Modi’s new India.||

Contrary to expectations, there was no noticeable improvement in the terms of trade for agriculture during the reform period. Moreover, decline in capital formation in agriculture, inadequate expenditure on irrigation and extension services in rural areas, and a dearth of cheap institutional credit, resulted in a slowdown of agricultural growth and heightened livelihood insecurity for a substantial proportion of those dependent on agriculture.||Shantanu De Roy

Contrary to the government’s claims, the implementation of the GST would not automatically enhance growth rate, reduce inflation or improve tax compliance. The calculations of the revenue neutral rates depend on various assumptions. Different states should be allowed to set their own state–GST rates with provisions for an entry tax. More emphasis should be put on direct taxes rather than the GST for improving India’s abysmally low tax to gross domestic product ratio.||

An econometric analysis of India’s scheduled commercial banks, however, establishes that in the Indian banking sector, mergers may actually be detrimental to efficiency. This paper argues that public sector banks were set up to serve the welfare needs of the underprivileged and to promote financial inclusion, not to make profits. In the case of bank mergers, economies of scale and scope are being used to veil the promotion of economies of exclusion.||
23-02-2017||special articles||---------||View from the Other Side : Urban Space as Understood by the Locals in 19th Century Calcutta||A different kind of understanding took shape among certain sections of the Bengali elite, that is, the professional middle- and upper-classes, which gave a primacy to the norms of society and the needs of the locals over the commercial interests of the colonial state. The local ideas tried to jostle for space with the dominant colonial ideas of the city and manifested in various forms. Also, unlike the colonial ideas, the local ideas about the city space were not identical and unitary, but tended to vary from person to person. However, in all these, the interests of the society were also kept in mind. Some of these writings provided a sharp critique to the colonial administration and its views about the city, be it on the sanitary measures adopted by the administration or the mindless commercialisation in the city. The larger focus of the local views was to provide a critique of the colonial administration, as well as the critique of the social decay brought by it.||Sudipto Basu

It shows that more women are now in high-paid jobs, while groups such as Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and Muslims are still engaged in menial low-paid jobs. Over the years, there has been a decline in gender inequality and a rise in socio-religious inequality. A decomposition analysis reveals that education and type of employment contribute most to income inequality.||Balwant Singh Mehta,Megha Shree

The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, Right to Education Act, Food Security Act and systematic investment in public healthcare if properly resourced and implemented, will constitute a giant step in solving the problems of inequality that plague a progressive and healthy India. About 1.5% and 3.5% of the GDP respectively is what it will take to offer education for all, and universal healthcare. India has some of the most enabling economic, political and demographic conditions; and certainly the resources for it; but the question remains as to whether we have the will.||

This is done by tracing the dynamics of urban planning and governance that have produced two interlinked types of infrastructural violence in the locality—municipal water denial and violent articulations of infrastructure by informal water providers—and the experiences of everyday conflict and violence that emerge in residents’ lives as a consequence. How conflicts and violence shape residents’ attempts to negotiate and attain better water access are also discussed.||Renu Desai,Shachi Sanghvi

This paper explores the impacts of the ongoing conflict involving criminal gangs, political parties and state security forces. Residents have adopted tactics and strategies ranging from negotiation to active resistance in response to the varied forms of everyday violence. Specifically focusing on street protests between 2012 and 2014, it evaluates the possibilities and limitations of protest in the context of urban violence. More broadly, it argues that studies of urban violence need to move away from viewing the urban poor as exclusively clientelistic or insurgent. It argues that acts of resistance in the form of protest are constrained, determined by, and productive of particular configurations of power.||Nida Kirmani

The “encroachments” of the poor are delegitimised and they become victims of eviction drives while encroachments by the state and the middle- and high-income classes on ecologically vulnerable areas are legitimised. In Guwahati, this has led to a cycle of violence and counter-violence. This paper sets this sequence of events against the historically contested land rights issue in a city with limited habitable land due to its natural ecology.||Darshini Mahadevia,Aseem Mishra,Yogi Joseph

Three main mechanisms have been adopted to produce space—infrastructure and mega-projects, redevelopment, and creating exception regimes for “slums.” The nature of the state that enacts structural violence through worlding processes is simultaneously “strong” and “weak.” It is strong in its bid to open up new spaces for capital accumulation that integrate specific economic circuits, classes and groups “globally,” while weak in its responsibility to protect and strengthen the life chances and claims of poor groups/spaces.||Himanshu Burte,Lalitha Kamath

This paper views the impact of these shifts and the violence/s embedded therein along the state–market axis. Intense everyday violence enhances insecurity among residents, women and young girls in particular in highly complex ways. However, far from being passive victims of this violence/s they are engaged in highly creative struggles to confront the multi-institutional injustices experienced by them.||Amita Bhide

Urban violence has many drivers and manifestations. However, the challenge is how to retrofit cities once violence takes hold, and to examine whether urban planning has a role in recovery. Can urban planning breed a new transparency and confidence that breaks embedded exclusionary urban management practices, and create new spaces of engagement, or is urban planning a root cause of the problems?||Alison Brown

Based on input –output tables and National Accounts Statistics, annual demand for road freight transport is estimated. Correspondingly, annual supply of road freight transport is obtained based on availability of diesel for road freight transport, stock of goods carriages, average freight transport capacity per vehicle, average annual distance travel, and average fuel efficiency per vehicle. The mismatch of supply and demand is broadly considered the unaccounted for portion of the gross domestic product. The methodology is tested for two successive input–output tables and three consecutive financial years. Since the analysis is based on assumptions, a comparative static analysis is carried out to check the sensitivity of estimates to changes in the assumptions.||

The paper also compares and contrasts variations in the rate of interest paid by different categories of farmers and agricultural labourers.||Gian Singh,Anupama,Gurinder Kaur,Rupinder Kaur,Sukhvir Kaur
09-02-2017||special articles||---------||Mothers-in-Law and Son Preference in India||Mothers-in-law are often portrayed as the most powerful entity in the household in Indian popular culture and media. In most literature too, the influence of Indian mothers-in-law is often taken for granted. However, most of the empirical evidence relies on qualitative data or on small samples. Looking at stated son preference and using the third National Family and Health Survey data set, the authors show that mothers-in-law do indeed have an influence on their daughters-in-law. Given the stronger son preference among mothers-in-law, this contributes to the high imbalance in the male to female sex ratio observed among children in India.||Marie-Claire Robitaille,Ishita Chatterjee

But a little more than a decade later, there are indications that the “pink tide” is beginning to ebb. In Argentina, the centre-right is in power, ending 12 years of left rule. Even in Venezuela and Brazil, recent trends point towards an unmistakable resurgence of right-wing forces. How does one interpret these changes? Does the current crisis mark the end of the Latin American left? While seeking to answer some of these questions, an understanding of the achievements and limitations of the “left turn” in Latin American politics is presented.||Samyukta Bhupatiraju,Rahul Sirohi
10-02-2017||notes||---------||‘Two Class’ Distribution of Income in India : Evidence from Income Tax Data (2012–13)||Results from the 2012–13 income tax data reveal that Indian incomes, particularly high salaries and wealth-related income, are statistically distributed into two distinct classes. The bulk of the reported income distribution can be explained by an exponential distribution, while a small fraction at the top follows a more unequal power law (Pareto) distribution. This distinction has important implications for inequality, and provides a point of comparison with similar statistical regularities observed in rich countries.||Rishabh Kumar

Quality of education is especially crucial in rural areas where the majority of children are constrained by parental illiteracy, poverty and poor facilities. The neglect of government and government-aided schools is further marginalising the marginalised.||Satvinderpal Kaur

The fluctuation in the voting preferences signals the crisis the Left Democratic Front is facing. Except for the extremely poor, all other socio-economic groups, including Dalits, Other Backward Castes, the lower classes and the younger generation, are highly volatile and are changing their political preferences, depending on the unfolding social reality.||J Prabhash,K M Sajad Ibrahim

Most journalists starting from editors are employed on contracts of three years or less, with an exit clause that permits them to leave or be fired on a notice of between one and three months. As a result, journalists have lost the courage to speak up or write about any issue that owners and managements do not want them to, including the issue of their own unstable working conditions. A number of media houses have been arbitrarily closing down editions or retrenching journalist and non-journalist staff while also going against the Majithia Wage Board recommendations but there is little coverage in the media about it.||Samrat

The ongoing tale of Ethiopia’s war on poverty is a fascinating one, combining elements of brutality and welfare; state control and limited privatisation; an apparent homogeneity of developmental output; and yet a vibrant variety in the details of the development process. It calls for serious exploration and documentation. One of the most revealing interventions in this regard is the Ethiopian affordable housing programme.||Antarin Chakrabarty
25-01-2017||special articles||---------||Precarious Measures and Precise Numbers : Fixing the Milestones in Early Colonial Eastern India||This article features the history of the placement of the milestones along the long road from Calcutta to Benares in the late 1820s. It inquires into the practices of measurement in early colonial India and attempts to understand how the numbers were produced as fixed and final entities of measurement practices. It exposes the confusion, recalcitrance, guesswork and reckoning behind the emergence of this numerate culture. The confusion over distance measurement was often attributed to the inauthenticity or absence of instruments, to the variation of routes followed by the surveyors. But in spite of all practical difficulties, the administration demanded precise distance charts to fix the payments of the postal runners. The officers had no options but to choose from a multiple number of distance charts and finalise the numbers inscribed on the milestones. This was the way “scientific” measurements were done and “exact” numbers were produced.||Paulami Guha Biswas
27-01-2017||special articles||---------||Social Identity and Wage Discrimination in the Indian Labour Market||Existing studies on caste- and religion-based wage discrimination in the Indian labour market have mainly focused on the wage gap between broadly classified social groups at the mean ignoring the gap at various points on the wage distribution. Using four rounds of unit level data from the National Sample Survey covering the period 1983 to 2011–12, this study shows that the wage gap and discrimination against socially disadvantaged groups vary markedly across the entire distribution. Further the wage discrimination against the two historically disadvantaged groups, the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, is underestimated when the comparison is with other communities. The wage inequality among social groups has widened for Muslims and remained more or less the same for STs and SCs during the post-reform period (1994–2012) and there is an increase in wage discrimination against SCs, STs and Muslims. A strong message that emerges is that social identity-based wage disparity and discrimination have not disappeared despite affirmative actions.||P Duraisamy,Malathy Duraisamy

Overall, just about 11% of households were enrolled and almost half of these households actually belonged to the non-poor category. Although the scheme has increased hospitalisation rate, we do not know if it has enabled people to access the “genuinely needed” inpatient care which they could not afford earlier or whether hospitals are inducing the demand by suggesting unnecessary inpatient care to the people. Disturbingly, it has hardly had any effects on financial protection. These evidences unequivocally indicate that targeted health insurance coupled with a healthcare delivery system dominated by private providers cannot be the means to achieve universal healthcare.||Soumitra Ghosh,Nabanita Datta Gupta

11-01-2017||insight||---------||Did Adani Group Evade ₹1,000 Crore Taxes?||The authors would like to clarify that the first paragraph in the “Conclusions” section (p 40) should have read as follows: “The DRI filed an appeal against the CESTAT order in the Supreme Court on 6 April 2016, which was eventually disposed of on 22 July 2016. The Ministry of Finance now has to file a review petition against this decision. The question that remains unanswered: what has dissuaded the ministry from filing this review petition even though more than five months have gone by?” This is the corrected version of the article. The corporate conglomerate headed by Gautam Adani has been accused by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence of having allegedly evaded taxes and laundered money to the tune of around ₹1,000 crore while trading in cut and polished diamonds and gold jewellery. The DRI has claimed that companies in the Adani Group misused export incentives and indulged in high-velocity circular trading through a complex web of front companies located in different parts of the world. The government seems strangely reticent about fi ling a review petition in the Supreme Court that could protect its revenue interests.||Paranjoy Guha Thakurta,Shinzani Jain,Advait Rao Palepu
11-01-2017||25 years of economic liberalisation||---------||Economic Liberalisation in India : Then and Now||Even if adjustment and reform in 1991 were driven by economic compulsions, it was the political process that made these possible. However, liberalisation was shaped largely by the economic problems of the government rather than by the economic priorities of the people or by long-term development objectives. Thus, there were limitations in conception and design which have been subsequently validated by experience. Jobless growth, persistent poverty and rising inequality have mounted as problems since economic liberalisation began. And, 25 years later, four quiet crises confront the economy, in agriculture, infrastructure, industrialisation and education as constraints on the country’s future prospects. These problems must be resolved if economic growth has to be sustained and transformed into meaningful development. In this quest, India needs a developmental state for its market economy to improve the living conditions of her people.||Deepak Nayyar
11-01-2017||25 years of economic liberalisation||---------||Markets, Growth and Social Opportunity : India since 1991||Since 1991, there has been an acceleration of economic growth accompanied by a widening of the range of consumer goods produced, together with improvement in the quality of services available. Furthermore, the economy has passed through the longest period since 1947 without facing balance-of-payments stress. However, not all sectors of the economy have shown the same dynamism, with the performance of agriculture actually becoming a cause for concern. The unequal distribution of social opportunity has meant that this shortcoming has left a significant section of the population in a low-income trap. What underlies this outcome is examined and what is needed to correct the imbalance is proposed.||Pulapre Balakrishnan
11-01-2017||25 years of economic liberalisation||---------||‘Fiscal Federalism’ in India since 1991 : Infirmities of Sound Finance Paradigm||The “reforms” in 1991 laid out a new trajectory in which federalism was dichotomised into two parts—political and fiscal. The fiscal was privileged and used to undermine the political. Fiscal federalism in India since 1991 rests on the contradictions generated by the theoretical infirmities of the sound finance paradigm along with a concerted undermining of federal provisions. This political drive is in keeping with the agenda since 1991, eroding the relative autonomy of the state to turn it into a facilitator of a macroeconomic expansion process in which the wage–surplus distribution becomes more and more favourable to capital.||Chirashree Das Gupta,Surajit Mazumdar
13-01-2017||25 years of economic liberalisation||---------||Economic Reforms and Manufacturing Sector Growth : Need for Reconfiguring the Industrialisation Model||Manufacturing output grew 7%–8% annually since 1991, with a marked improvement in the variety and quality of goods produced. Yet, its share in gross domestic product has practically stagnated, with a sharp rise in import intensity. Liberal (or market-friendly) policies were expected to boost labour intensive exports and industrial growth. Why did the manufacturing sector fail to realise these goals? It is widely believed that India needs to “complete” the reform agenda to realise its potential. Critically examining such a view, it is suggested that the long-term constraints on industrialisation perhaps lie in poor agricultural productivity and inadequate public infrastructure. Further, there is a need to re-imagine the role of the development state to realise goals, as the experience of all successful industrialising nations suggests.||R Nagaraj
13-01-2017||special articles||---------||Babu’s Camelot : Amaravati and the Emerging Capitalist Dynamics in ‘New’ Andhra Pradesh||Three key dynamics have come to the fore in the fresh cycle of capitalism that is unfolding in the new state of Andhra Pradesh. First, capitalist accumulation is happening with a weak articulation and incorporation of labour. Second, capitalist development is being visualised in a city-centric paradigm with a weak vision of integrating the hinterlands. Third, these two dynamics are perceived by the state and the ruling elite to have little opposition, a kind of thesis with a weak antithesis. This paper provides a critique of these emerging dynamics in the hope of imagining a more inclusive Andhra Pradesh.||Vamsi Vakulabharanam,N Purendra Prasad

Incorrect economic arithmetic and the illusion of digitalisation are not the only problems to be negotiated. The moral political project overtly and covertly being attempted, is of far greater significance.||
05-01-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||Making Pulses Affordable Again : Policy Options from the Farm to Retail in India||While outlining strategies to increase availability of pulses at affordable prices, it is argued that increasing domestic production of pulses is the only option. Access to one or two protective irrigation sources during the growing season can lead to sizeable increases in pulse production. The har khet ko paani initiative should give priority to pulse-producing areas. The minimum support price, without procurement, helps traders more than farmers because it acts as a focal point for tacit collusion among traders. Including subsidised pulses in the public distribution system has only a small effect on consumption of pulses. We suggest investing in research and extension, aggregating into farmer producer organisations, and paying growers or growing areas for the ecosystem services offered by pulses.||P K Joshi,Avinash Kishore,Devesh Roy
05-01-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||Reconsidering Women’s Work in Rural India : Analysis of NSSO Data, 2004–05 and 2011–12||The most recent data gathered by the National Sample Survey Office on work participation for women in India reveal a sharp decline, primarily due to the NSSO’s conventional measures not accounting for economic activities undertaken by women for the benefit of households. Alternative definitional approaches to the production boundary, such as the Indian System of National Accounts and the United Nations System of National Accounts, somewhat better account for unpaid work by women for households’ own consumption. An analysis of data from the part of the NSSO schedule on employment and unemployment (for 2004–05 and 2011–12) that enquires about various activities undertaken by individuals who report performing household activities as their principal activity, reveals a less dramatic decline than that presented by the more conventional measure of work participation. This finding contributes to a significant rethinking of how rural women’s contributions to economic activities for their own households can be better recognised through data.||Mohammed Zakaria Siddiqui,Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt,Stewart Lockie,Bill Pritchard
05-01-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||Making Smallholder Farming Climate-smart : Integrated Agrometeorological Services||Climate change is accompanied by increasing weather uncertainty. Farmers, especially smallholder farmers, need advance warning of emergent weather conditions at a local level. Mobile telecommunication systems are increasingly cost-effective and an efficient way of delivering weather-based agro-advisories to farmers at a large scale. Agrometeorological services facilitate flexible, weather-based agriculture planning and help build evidence and capacities of communities, technical and developmental agencies to plan and implement climate-adaptive responses. The relevance and innovativeness of multi-institutional collaboration lies in the institutional, technical and pedagogical strategy adopted which offers important lessons on how agrometeorological services can be organised to make smallholder farming climate-resilient on a larger scale.||Crispino Lobo,N Chattopadhyay,K V Rao
05-01-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||Understanding Open Defecation in Rural India : Untouchability, Pollution, and Latrine Pits||India has far higher open defecation rates than other developing regions where people are poorer, literacy rates are lower, and water is relatively more scarce. In practice, government programmes in rural India have paid little attention in understanding why so many rural Indians defecate in the open rather than use affordable pit latrines. Drawing on new data, a study points out that widespread open defecation in rural India is on account of beliefs, values, and norms about purity, pollution, caste, and untouchability that cause people to reject affordable latrines. Future rural sanitation programmes must address villagers’ ideas about pollution, pit-emptying, and untouchability, and should do so in ways that accelerate progress towards social equality for Dalits rather than delay it.||Diane Coffey,Aashish Gupta,Payal Hathi,Dean Spears,Nikhil Srivastav,Sangita Vyas

It is found that the choice of energy source is closely linked with women’s participation in the management of energy resources, their opportunities to earn incomes, and their ability to negotiate the cultural and social norms of their communities. Energy planning cannot stop with the provision of household access to electricity or liquefied petroleum gas. A new deal for women in the energy sector is delineated, which relates to overcoming sociocultural limits and increasing the opportunity cost of women’s labour and their right to assets.||Govind Kelkar,Dev Nathan,Patricia Mukhim,Rosemary Dzuvichu
05-01-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||‘Do Only Girls Suffer? We Too!’ : Early Marriage Repercussions on Boys in Rural India||Research in India has been oriented towards understanding the causes and consequences of early marriage on girls, while ignoring the condition of “child grooms.” There are many “hotspots” in India, where early marriage of boys is an accepted norm. Using available evidence from national surveys and qualitative data collected from Shrawasti district of Uttar Pradesh, attempts are made to understand the reasons behind the early marriage of boys and the difficulties faced by these young men who are forced into marriage. In such regions, raising the age at marriage for boys will automatically raise the age at marriage for girls. If we have to address the problem of “child brides,” we can no longer ignore the presence of “child grooms.”||Aparna Mukherjee,T V Sekher
05-01-2017||review of rural affairs||---------||Transitions in Rice Seed Provisioning in Odisha : Constraints and Reform Agenda||Rice farmers in India have traditionally kept a portion of their harvest as seeds for the next planting. In this traditional system, public sector production and marketing of seeds of improved varieties developed through public research and development played a critical role in promoting the green revolution. In recent years, the seed system of rice in India is undergoing a transition towards increasing involvement of the private sector, especially in production and marketing of seeds. Such transitions have been driven by a number of economic and institutional changes that have made private provision of rice seeds economically viable. At the same time, economic justifications of public sector involvement in subsidised seed production and marketing are weakening. Through a case study of Odisha, this paper highlights the nature of transition taking place in rice seed provisioning.||Sushil Pandey,Debdutt Behura,Maria Lourdes Velasco

The high growth rate of the economy as a whole has not led to a similar growth pattern for its regions. An analysis on regional convergence across 15 major states in India suggests that there is divergence of the aggregate economy for the period 1970–71 to 2013–14. The findings therefore do not lend support to the expectations of the neoclassical convergence hypothesis according to which poor regions tend to catch up with the advanced regions in the long run leading to regional convergence.||Prerna Sanga,Abdul Shaban
