The devastating floods in 2014 led Kashmiris to increasingly challenge perceptions of nature or natural disasters as apolitical. Dams are an integral part of border-making processes, and gender, space, and borders are continually co-produced through militarised infrastructures. Women’s resistant imaginaries, which combine political and ecological metaphors, and rely on conceptions of jinn and other non-human agency, offer a way to rethink Kashmir beyond its securitised geographies.||Mona Bhan
22-11-2018||insight||---------||Saving the Vishwamitri : An Ongoing Tussle between Waterfront Development and River Rejuvenation||Waterfront development projects have been promoted in the name of flood control, beautification, and urban development. However, they only replace the river’s natural riparian edge with a concrete riverfront, facilitating further encroachment on and destruction of the riverbed. The Gujarat government promulgated the Vishwamitri Riverfront Development Project as a “smart” solution to the river’s deterioration, completely ignoring environmental safeguards.||Lara Jesani
26-10-2018||perspectives||---------||Decentralisation of Environmental Regulations in India||The decentralisation of Environment Impact Assessment processes has improved the enforcement of environmental regulations and been successful in reducing polluting activities in India. Evidence suggests that decentralisation was associated with relatively fewer firm births in states with stricter environmental law enforcement. In such a scenario, the development of stronger collaborations between various stakeholders would enhance the enforcement of environmental regulations and reduce disparities between states, through knowledge and resource sharing, and improving technical, financial and administrative capabilities.||Ruth Kattumuri,Stefania Lovo
10-10-2018||review of environment and development||---------||Global Status of Agroecology : A Perspective on Current Practices, Potential and Challenges||Over the last decade, agroecology has rapidly moved from the margins and taken centre stage in global discussions on environment and development. Institutions like the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization increasingly argue that agroecology can significantly help alleviate hunger and poverty as well as contribute to meeting other sustainable development goals. In this context, the history and practices of agroecology are outlined, and some of the ecological, social, economic, and political challenges for transformation to agroecology and food sovereignty have been identified.||Michel P Pimbert
10-10-2018||review of environment and development||---------||Urbanisation and New Agroecologies : The Story of Bengaluru’s Peripheries||Rural–urban interfaces worldwide are increasingly witnessing massive transformations in the structure, functions, and services of complex ecosystems of these zones. An attempt has been made to understand the transitions triggered by urbanisation in the peri-urban agricultural systems of Bengaluru. Using a combination of land-use change analysis and group interactions, the temporal and spatial patterns in the impacts of urban expansion on agroecology in Bengaluru’s peripheries have been traced. The varying nature of agroecological and sociocultural impacts corresponding to differences in the pattern of urban expansion along different directions from the city have also been unravelled. Further, agroecological repercussions of existing and proposed urban planning strategies for Bengaluru have been discussed.||Sheetal Patil,Dhanya B,Raghvendra S Vanjari,Seema Purushothaman

The principal crop in Tamil Nadu is rice, which is water intensive. Millets, in general, are less water intensive and more capable of withstanding drought conditions. An agroecological system of farming millets ought to take into account not only water use, but also the whole gamut of political and ecological issues that are connected to farming such as public procurement, land reform, minimum support price, subsidised credit, agricultural extension services, and so on. The publicly procured millet output may be distributed through the public distribution system, government schools, and through the network of Amma canteens in the state.||C Saratchand
12-10-2018||review of environment and development||---------||Indian Agriculture : Redefining Strategies and Priorities||Sustainability of agriculture depends on soil management systems that ensure food security, healthy soils and ecosystem services, and prevent resource degradation. Globally, conservation agriculture has provided a common thread for the application of five sustainability principles—efficient use of water, reduced use of agrochemicals , improved soil health, adapt to climate change, and doubling farmer income—in order to tie the mix of interventions with local needs and priorities of the farmers. For food and ecological sustainability of Indian agriculture, the state’s interventions must be on the basis of the conservation agriculture approach.||Raj Gupta,Mamta Mehra,Rabi Narayan Sahoo,Inder Abrol
12-10-2018||review of environment and development||---------||Bovine Politics and Climate Justice||Caught between deepening ecological, climate, and economic crises, marginal and small farmers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have been systematically pushed out of dairy and other livestock livelihoods. The growing political environment in India, openly supportive of cow-related hate crimes in the name of upholding anti-slaughter laws, is further destroying farmer livelihoods. Smallholder farmers are organising in creative ways, radically opposed to the dominant policy recommendation, in order to counter this situation and build climate and economic resilience that is socially just.||
21-09-2018||special articles||---------||Climate Justice and Gandhian Morality||Gandhian principles of morality have in the past been linked in various ways to India’s approach to environmental governance and, more recently, to the contemplation of the broader global debate on climate change. The applicability of these principles to conceptions of climate justice is examined by exploring the ways in which the idea of M K Gandhi is articulated in an Indian context. The vocalisation of Gandhi as a symbol of Indian engagement with climate change and sustainable development asks to be located within broader normative perspectives on the content and directionality of a Gandhian approach. Ideas of cosmopolitanism and “realised justice” supply a useful backdrop for a contemporary reading of Gandhi, and draw attention to several questions that this article examines.||Ramya K Tella
24-08-2018||special articles||---------||India’s Electronics Manufacturing Sector : Getting the Diagnosis Right||The Indian electronics industry’s high dependence on imports can be directly linked to trade and investment policy liberalisation, in the absence of vertical industrial policy measures to improve productivity and capabilities. With the failure of passive industrial policies oriented towards attracting foreign direct investment, growth in domestic electronics manufacturing will have to come from a comprehensive policy approach encompassing trade, FDI, technology, taxation, infrastructure development, environmental protection, and education and skill development. Apart from significantly increasing the public fund outlay for research and development, such an industrial policy intervention must subsidise the cost of commercialising new innovations and expand the market for domestic electronics products by interlinking the demands of upstream industries with downstream manufacturers through incentives.||Smitha Francis
22-06-2018||-------||---------||Can the Movement Against Hydropower Projects in Sikkim be Reactivated?||The indigenous tribal community in Sikkim regard their land and the Rivers Teesta and Rangeet as sacred and integral to their civilisations heritage. However, the industrialisation efforts have not only displaced and marginalised this community from the development plans within their ecologically and culturally protected area. The need for grassroots protest and organisation against the construction of hydro-electrical dams along the river and in protected forest areas has recently been reinvigorated.||
24-05-2018||special articles||---------||Making Ash Disappear : Challenges and Opportunities in Fly Ash Utilisation||The Indian government has been pushing for a target of 1.5 billion tonnes of coal production annually by 2020, most of which will be used in the electricity sector. In this context, current issues—status, policies, regulations, and bottlenecks—regarding the disposal of fly ash generated by thermal power plants are examined. Scenarios of ash generation and utilisation are presented. Blending fly ash in cement is the most environmentally sustainable and financially attractive method of its utilisation. Finally, key technical, regulatory, pricing, logistical, and behavioural issues that need to be urgently addressed to reach complete fly ash utilisation are discussed.||Mohd Sahil Ali
10-05-2018||commentary||---------||Technologies to Alleviate Pollution : Air and Water Purification||Technologies are believed to be problem-solving. However, this may not always be true, especially in terms of their influence on the environment. The emphasis on purification technologies to solve issues arising due to environmental pollution raises the question as to whether short-term solutions, like air and water purifiers, can result in salvaging the health of people and the environment.||

04-05-2018||-------||---------||Draft Pesticide Management Bill is Out of Sync With the Agrarian Political Economy||The bill ignores ground realities of sale and consumption of agrichemicals. Any bill genuinely concerned about agrichemicals management must begin with the recognition that much of agriculture is plagued by a deep economic, ecological, and cultural crisis. The government must go back to the drawing board and reformulate the very objectives of the bill.||

With landfills ranking third in terms of greenhouse gas emissions in India, and increasing pressure from the public, the Government of India revised the Solid Waste Management after 16 years.. This paper proposes an institutional framework that will address this grave environmental and public health concern and bring about a systemic change in the sector.||
13-04-2018||commentary||---------||Pancheshwar Dam : Destruction in the Name of Development||Despite large dams being decommissioned the world over, the government has now set its sights on the construction of the Pancheshwar dam on the ecologically sensitive Mahakali river. Wary of being sacrificed at the altar of so-called “development,” resistance to the project has transformed into a concerted people’s protest, which continues to gain momentum.||Rakesh Agrawal
09-02-2018||commentary||---------||Tamil Nadu Revives Kudimaramathu : Ancient Wisdom of Water Management||Finally realising the economic and environmental benefits of small waterbodies, the Tamil Nadu government has revived kudimaramathu, the centuries-old practice of building and maintaining ponds and tanks with community involvement. This article recounts the history of the practice, its marginalisation in colonial times, and the politics that drives its revival today. The scheme will be successful and sustainable only if local farmers and stakeholders are empowered to select, maintain and repair these waterbodies.||S Rajendran
19-01-2018||commentary||---------||Singapore and the Smoke Haze Crisis||The 2013 and 2015 episodes of smoke haze over Singapore were some of the worst environmental crises in the nation’s history. Severe haze caused by land clearance fires in Indonesia blanketed Singapore for more than a month each time, leading to a dramatic shift in public attention and policies regarding the nation’s engagement with its neighbouring resource-extractive economies. This article reads the development of this crisis through the myth of the “air-conditioned nation,” arguing that it presents an opportunity to reconnect capitalism and regionalisation with their consequences.||Theresa Wong

Estimates of Expenditure on Rituals and Impact on Ecology||Even though death seems to wipe out all social inequalities, ways of disposing dead bodies continue to perpetuate economic differences. This article provides an indicative estimate of the costs incurred in cremation and burial according to religious affiliations. Findings show that while rich people’s spending on death rituals reflects their social position, the poor with limited means struggle hard to conform to normative practices. Traditional methods of corpse disposal have environmental costs. With 105 people dying every minute, there is an urgent need to adopt greener as well as cost-effective ways of handling dead-bodies in India.||
11-01-2018||review of urban affairs||---------||Urban Jungles : Wilderness, Parks and Their Publics in Delhi||In an exploration of the processes through which urban India acquires or loses green spaces, this article examines how parks and urban publics are mutually constituted in Delhi. Social change has led to a re-imagination of cultural meanings and modes of ecological management. Ecological change, in turn, has created new social relations around the use and protection of nature. Analysing Mangarbani, a sacred grove on the edge of the metropolis, and the Delhi Ridge, a “wilderness” domesticated for recreational use, the author argues that the creation and preservation of certain forms of urban nature relate to the shifting sensibilities of elites, especially the section that acts as a self-appointed vanguard of environmental causes. However, other users of public green areas challenge the far-reaching effects of this “bourgeois environmentalism.” The contested meanings and practices around urban natures create new alliances and understandings that may promote ecology and justice.||Amita Baviskar
