However, it contains a provision that encroachments found not eligible for regularisation should be vacated immediately. Since there are several deficiencies in the government Order and the lists of eligible encroachments have still not been finally prepared, any attempts to vocate existing encroachments will be unjust to the adivasis.||S.

For the Pathan, colonisation meant destroyed villages, water tanks and grain stores; it meant electrified fences, block houses and unending series of 'butcher and bolt' raids. When the British finally left in 1947, the legacy they left behind did not consist of schools or colleges or such other symbols of development, but of repressive institutions like Frontier Scouts and Constabulary. The barrenness of the colonial encounter in the Frontier is in notable contrast to that in Bengal, across the sub-continent, or even across the Indus in the Punjab. Nevertheless, the Pathan-British encounter has been permeated with a strong element of 'romance' which is reflected in the memoirs and accounts left by the British as well as in the creative works by writers like Kipling - though the Pathan himself has never been able to see the noble and romantic aspects of the encounter. This article examines the causal factors that led to the mystification of the colonial encounter, and the social and political needs that such mystification fulfilled.||Akbar S. Ahmed

The author attempts to distinguish the different groups that would be affected by the project, their respective net gains, and how they affect considerations of social profitability. This attempt at a cost-benefit analysis specifically views the project from the point of view of its benefits and costs at market prices, its impact on farmers, labourers and poorer sections, and in terms of regional development and larger social values.||K.

If traditional farming and grazing practices are allowed to continue in the Kumaon tracts, not only will the hill populations destroy the hill environment on which their own livelihood depends and be forced to migrate to the plains, but the damage caused to plains agriculture by alternating floods and droughts, silting, and possible climatic changes will endanger the livelihood of the whole nation.||Madhava Ashish

Private tubewell irrigation picked up with the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan, and since then the number of private tubewells has risen steadily, from 3,000 in 1951 to 22,000 in 1961, 540,000 in 1971 and about 1.75 million in 1978. Area irrigated by tubewells too (both public and private) has increased from about 0.25 million hectares in 1961-62 to about five and a half million hectares in 1973-74. Today, tubewells probably account for 30 per cent of the total irrigation facilities of the country, though the percentage varies widely from state to state. This article attempts to assess the trends in tubewell irrigation during the 1951-78 period of planning and analyse the chief factors behind these trends.||B. D. Dhawan
