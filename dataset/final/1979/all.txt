Working apparently at cross purposes and staking rival claims to have reached the summit of Dravida Iyakkam, these two streams defy the authoritarian logic inherent in glib condemnations of 'regional forces' and the arrogant advocacy of an allegdly ideal 'two party model' for countries like India. Such a view does not take into account the character of the actual 'parties' in whose interest the 'two-party system' is allowed to function and develop, nor the class forces whose aspirations they express. It also ignores the historical forces which gave rise to such phenomenon as the Dravidian Movement which, for all its weaknesses, inconsistencies and limitations, cannot be summarily dismissed as being antagonistic to an 'all-India' approach whose ideal political expression is alleged to be found in a 'two-party system'. This article attempts a political explanation of the complex of historical forces that were working in the second half of the 19th century and which gave rise to the Dravidian Movement.||N. Ram

It is idle to think that poverty in the rural areas can be fought without the support of the urban poor and that rural development can be achieved without the support of urban industrial development. Posing the question of poverty as one of town vs village, or of caste vs caste, therefore, ultimately helps in perpetuating system-generated poverty; and 'ruralism' and 'casteism' in the Indian context perform the ideological function of a mystifying force, keeping the poor in darkness about the social genesis of poverty and thus thwarting their emergence as a socially conscious force.||P.

In this paper the author presents some examples of such 'technological displacement' from the public as well as the domestic sector. Since the role of women in food production is of such vital importance economically as well as for the well-being of the family, the examples centre on technologies related to food. Also discussed in the paper are some of the consequences of this pattern of 'development' along with some strategies for research and action.||Brita Brandtzaeg

In the first part of the paper the author studies the functioning of the State Trading Corporation of India. The second part of the paper draws on this experience to formulate some tentative conclusions and recommendations with respect to the management of public sector enterprises as a whole. These may help in improving our understanding of the behaviour and performance of public sector managers and in examining the need for a clearer ideology for public sector management.||G. R. Kulkarni

A discussion of how they work can contribute to an informed debate on what direction the reform of irrigation institutions in India should take.

It is argued that the procedure followed is inadequate for a number of reasons, and that for a satisfactory matching of plans and policies an understanding of farm supply responses is essential. Against this background, the authors discuss the determinants of supply responses in Indian agriculture. They review the results of some studies to highlight the policy implications that can be drawn from such studies and also present some results of their own study on farm supply response behaviour and compare their results with those of past studies. Finally, the authors use their results to indicate some of the policies that need to be pursued if the targeted composition of acreage and agricultural production in the Draft Sixth Plan are to be realised.||N.

What happens to the gamut of the workers' experiences in the workplace and in the trade union? Do they have any significance for his life outside the work sphere? If they do, how do these new forces relate to the traditional loyalties of the workers? Do traditional loyalties get displaced, or do they get transformed in the process of interacting with new ones? Some of these questions are answered in the context of three broad areas: the culture of the leaders and their role in the social life of workers; inter-caste relations especially between the Harijans and the upper castes; and the forces influencing the politics of a working class neighbourhood.||Uma Ramaswamy

10/11/1979- ||special articles||4368117||Land Reforms and the Draft Five Year Plan 1978-83||Document after official document acknowledges that fundamental changes in agrarian relations are essential for any improvement of the conditions of the rural poor; that existing legislation on land reforms is inadequate; and that the implementation of even these inadequate measures has been unsatisfactory. The latest Plan document; Draft Five Year Plan, 1978-83, too acknowledges these facts and proposes, among other things, the setting-up of committees of potential beneficiaries in villages to ensure the implementation of existing legislation. This article questions some of these assumptions and ideas, derived apparently from the experience of post-war Japan in the field of land reforms. Basing itself on the experience of the two UF governments in West Bengal in 1967-72, and the present Left Front government in that state, the article argues that only strong political commitment to structural changes in agrarian relations, and an equally militant politicisation of the peasantry can bring about implementation of land reforms.||Ratan Ghosh

Their share in the government's total budgetary expenditure has also gone up sharply from about 1 per cent in 1954-55 to 7.6 per cent in 1977-78. This paper seeks to review the trends in budgetary subsidies and examine the ostensible purposes for which they are granted with a view to seeing if the present size of subsidies can be reduced without jeopardising the government's objectives in granting them.||M.

An emphasis on caste as the defining characteristic implies a cultural continuity between the lower and higher strata of society; but this obfuscates the radical differences between them, differences which exist largely due to the labouring class character of the lower caste community. On the other hand, to emphasise only their class characteristics would neglect the many members of lower castes who have begun to move out of their labouring class roles but for whom social discrimination is a real form of oppression. Then too, the many social movements which have erupted from the lower castes during this century have been based more on cultural solidarity than on labouring class unity, and yet have provided a basis for collective economic mobility for the lower castes. The movements have capitalised on both the social and the economic integrity of the lower caste community. One might regard the lower caste communities, then, as 'cultures of deprivation', in which there are both social and economic elements. The word 'culture', as it is used by some anthropologists, implies a complete sub-society, with integrated social, religious, economic, and customary practices which are distinctly different from those of the larger society. The word 'deprivation' suggests an awareness of the limitations of these cultural elements vis-a-vis the larger society, and a social identity built upon that awareness. Both of these matters need to be argued and described further; and that is the purpose of this article. The description is based on three case studies in Punjab.||Mark Juergensmeyer

10/11/1979- ||special articles||4368118||Viability of Vizag Steel Plant||Several plus points have been claimed for the Vizag steel plant. Firstly, being a coast-based plant, imported raw materials, in particular coking coal, need not be transported over land at sizeable freight cost. Similarly, there would be no movement over land of finished goods, such as pig iron earmarked for export to the Soviet Union as part of any buy-back arrangements. Secondly, the individual pieces of equipment would be of a large size, enabling achievement of economies of scale. Thirdly, the Vizag plant would employ a continuous casting facility for blooms and billets bringing about savings in energy and labour costs. This note attempts to examine these claims. After such an enquiry, one cannot help being circumspect about the economic viability of the Vizag plant.||S. V. Char

The first part of the paper briefly reviews the development of Indian agriculture since independence and examines whether there is a correlation between growth and the application of modern science and technology in the spatial pattern of agricultural development in the country. The second part of the paper discusses the nature of the new technology and the extent of its capital intensity. It also investigates whether this capital intensity has led to wholesale displacement of labour from agriculture. The third part discusses the income distribution impact of the new technology and attempts to determine whether the new technology has led to a process of proletarianisation and immiserisation in the countryside. The fourth part of the paper outlines the inter-relationship between technology and institutions and the fifth part summarises the conclusions of the study.||G. S. Bhalla
15/12/1979- ||special articles||4368234||Bangladesh: Anatomy of a Coup||When, on the night of August 14, 1975, Shaikh Mujibur Rahman was killed along with a large number of members of his family and friends, it was put out that the assassins had acted unilaterally, with no larger political objective than of ridding the country of a tyrant. Unspecific talk about 'foreign involvement' in the assassination or, more explicitly, of CIA involvement, was, on the basis of evidence available then, rightly dismissed as specious propaganda. These conclusions need to be now completely re-examined. According to new information obtained from interviews with senior US embassy officials then in Dacca, from well-iinformed Bengali sources, and from official documents available in the US now consequent upon the Freedom of Information Act, it now appears that not only did the US have prior knowledge of the coup, but that American embassy personnel had discussed possibilities of a coup more than six months prior to his death. But the links of the conspirators with the US do not date merely to the period immediately preceding the coup; they go back to the days of the provisional government of Bangladesh functioning from Calcutta in 1971. This article lays bare the anatomy of the coup. The article is being published in two parts. The first part, published last week, critically examined the dominant version of the 'facts' surrounding the August 1975 coup. Part two, being published this week, describes the manner in which intelligence bureaucracies function and argues that the dividing line between American foreknowledge of the conspiracy to kill Mujibur Rehman and actual complicity in the killing is very thin; but it can be inferred that the US authorities in Dacca preferred 'to know nothing'. The end of Mujib, as the end of Bhutto in Pakistan four years later, highlights the peculiar perils which a client state has to face; it also marks the end of an entire era of false hopes and illusions surrounding the prospects for social democracy in conditions of severe backwardness and underdevelopment.||Lawrence Lifschultz,Kai Bird

1/8/1979- ||------||4367815||On the Question of Home Market and Prospects for Indian Growth||The demand problem in the Indian economy is much better viewed as an important tendency that has got built into the system rather than as a projection of the experience of the last few years. The factors that tend to produce 'demand deficiency' in relative terms have a lot to do with a growing rigidity in the structure of prices throughout the economy, both agricultural and industrial, with an upward trend imparted through a highly permissive monetary policy, insufficient generation of employment opportunities, absence of bargaining power on the part of the rural poor and the myopic character of private investment. True, the State has, through its commanding position in the process of financial intermediation, acquired an ability to invest significantly in excess of its savings. This, along with an increasing inflow of foreign aid, can keep the rate of investment at a higher level than would have been possible otherwise. There is, however, an inherent element of instability about such a process of growth which can be easily aggravated by exogenous factors. Besides, such a system cannot possess the kind of dynamism that marks processes of capital accumulation which are based on rapid absorption of labour into relatively more productive work and/or permit real wages to increase in terms of those goods whose costs decline as a result of capital accumulation. The process of growth, as a result, is likely to be inequitable as well as slow. It is in the combition of these two features that the source of the market problem in an economy such as India's has to be located.||Sukhamoy Chakravarty

This paper, based on a study of a sample of 150 villages in two talukas of Thane district in Maharashtra, attempts to examine the impact of economic development on rural women, particularly on their employment. Its findings are that a progressive reduction in the size of female workforce, together with a widening male-female wage differential, appears to be an inescapable part of such development as the country has been having. While the problem of declining size of female workforce in rural areas is inevitably linked with the general problem of increasing unemployment, female workers are worse sufferers in this respect than male workers.||S.

Towards this end, the Government of India has introduced a number of schemes since Independence. However, all these attempts towards greater participation of workers in industrial management have failed to fulfil the objectives for which they were promoted. This paper attempts to examine the causes for the failure and argues that in India, where the private sector dominates a large number of industries, the scheme of workers' participation in management has to remain a mere idea.||K.

1/2/1979- ||dialectical relationships||4367352||Caste Conflicts vs Growing Unity of Popular Democratic Forces||Unlike in Europe where Slave Society succeeded barbarism, in India the ruin and disruption of prehistoric tribal society led to the creation of a society consisting of a large number of social groups or castes, each with its own sense of solidarity. In other words, the factor of class was covered by caste society, which in theory existed in 'age-old' idyllic and self-sufficient village communities. The destruction of this 'age-old' village system and the development of new capitalist relations in all walks of life - begun by the British and continued since Independence in the midst of surviving precapitalist social formations - has led to two apparently contradictory features in Indian society and politics: the emergence of a working class and a growing unity among them as a class; and a disruption of the unity of the working class and the toiling people as evidenced in the increasing conflicts between 'backward' and 'forward' castes, in the intensified attacks on Harijans and other minorities, etc. These divisions and tensions cannot be simply attributed to the 'casteism' and 'communalism': such divisions and tensions were built into the national movement itself whose leaders were primarily moved - even when being, for all appearances, thoroughly scientific, modern and secular - by an unhistorical desire to revive the 'age-old' Indian civilisation and culture, based on the idyllic village communities at whose centre was the unalterable division of society into a hierarchy of castes. It is the refusal of millions of Indian people to be bound by the ideology of Varnashrama Dharma, and whose social and political activities, in howsoever distorted a manner, represent a revolt against the open and covert attempts to re-establish the 'age-old' village society that has contributed most to the present continuing 'caste' and 'communal' tensions in Indian society.||E.

1/8/1979- ||------||4367823||World Tobacco: Dynamics of Oligopolistic Annexationism||This paper examines the origins, role and remification of conglomerate oligopolistic power in world tobacco economy. The power of the tobacco transnational conglomerates (TTCs) is such that many developed and underdeveloped countries have been totally marginalised in the output and marketing decision processes. Underdeveloped capitalist countries supply 55 per cent of world leaf tobacco; but their processed exports are almost non-existent, they have no influence whatsoever in the design, output and innovation of tobacco machinery, and their aggregate receipts from tobacco are based almost exclusively on the demand, response and marketing decisions dictated by the TTCs. Such an evolution of the political economy of tobacco is not unique; its historic trends - global dominance by a handful of TTCs and relegation of peripheral economies to a dependent relationship under TTC hegemony - are common to a majority of the 25 odd commodities which dominate non-petroleum exports of the underdeveloped countries. Likewise, the TTCs too are not unique; in their effective creation of barriers to new entrants by way of active non-price competition with each other, generation of massive surplus cash flows, cross-subsidisation into new product lines and the building up of mutual self-reinforcing relations with other transnational conglomerates, the TTCs represent the ultimate stage in the development of oligopolistic capitalism in the last quarter of the twentieth century.||Frederick F.

That the government itself was not quite convinced of its denials of the practice was evident in the appointment of a Committee by the state government to examine the problem of illicit money-lending in the state, but which was also asked "to investigate whether the system of bonded labour still exists in the state... and to suggest ways and means to eradicate the system". This article briefly examines the background to the appointment of this Committee and presents a critical summary of its findings.||S. D. Kulkarni

The additional taxation measures are designed more to make up for the loss of revenue on account of concessions granted to a certain class of the rural population than with any overall objective of resource mobilisation. Given the political and economic conditions prevailing in the country today, some of these features of the Budget are likely to retard the process of long-run growth with social justice and, therefore, need serious consideration.||B.

Very little has been achieved in the field of commodities; the situation in regard to manufactures appears to be worse, with the developed world having decided to go it alone with the MTN under GATT auspices; on money, it has been well known that the rich countries strongly resent giving any role at all to UNCTAD. The lesson of UNCTAD for the poor countries should be that if they wish to secure any substantive changes in the present economic framework they must strive to forge genuine, and not just formal, unity among themselves. For this purpose, they ought to be engaged more actively as well as seriously in dialogue among themselves. Maybe, a short pause in global economic dialogues will do the poor countries considerable good.||I. S. Gulati

1/2/1979- ||peninsular movement||4367359||The Dalit Liberation Movement in Colonial Period||This paper attempts to survey the history of dalit struggles in relation to the national movement and the communist movement, and to bring to the fore the important role the dalit movement has played in the democratic movement of the country and is going to play in the new democratic struggles in the future. Communists have to think seriously about the theoretical basis for an immediate practical solution to the problem of caste oppression. This issue is emerging on a national scale today and is taking new forms, where the masses of caste Hindu poor peasants and even agricultural labourers are participating in attacks on dalits under the leadership of rich farmers. The problem is one of posing a real programme for agrarian revolution; for, what the rich farmers are proposing today (and what constitutes an important basis of their appeal to poor and middle peasants) is their own solution to the agrarian problem and unemployment - a capitalist solution of giving land to the (landed) tiller and employing the rest as agricultural labourers and in small industries. A concrete alternative has, therefore, to be put forward - a programme which does more than simply ameliorate the condition of dalits as proletarianised agricultural labourers or give them 'waste' surplus land which keeps in view the specific nature of caste relations in the rural area and the need for building a revolutionary unity between dalits and caste Hindu toilers, between agricultural labourers and poor and middle peasants.||Bharat Patankar,Gail Omvedt

28/4/1979- ||special articles||4367550||Direct Tax Reform: Family as Tax Entity and Other Issues||The draft five year plan 1978-83 calls for a major effort at mobilisation of additional resources. Much of this effort will have to be directed towards raising further tax revenues. So far, the policy-makers have mainly relied on indirect taxes in their efforts to raise additional resources. Since indirect taxes already contribute more than 77 per cent of the total tax revenues, a stage has clearly been reached where we have to rely increasingly on direct taxes. In examining the possible changes in the system of direct taxation, while revenue implications are no doubt important, considerations of equity and incentive cannot be ignored. Within the set of direct taxes, income-tax is the principal source of revenue. The focus of this paper, therefore, is on possible rationalisation of the system of income taxation. It excludes from the scope of its analysis provisions relating to enterprises, incorporated or otherwise, including co-operative societies. Limiting the scope to the taxation of individuals and Hindu undivided families (HUFs), attention is focused on the question of what ought to be the tax entity, the tax treatment of his entity, and the consequences thereof in terms of equity and revenue. In this context, some of the existing provisions on exemptions and deductions are reviewed from the point of view of equity and incentive for saving.||K. Sundaram,V. Pandit

This paper argues that while international proposals such as the adoption of the code of conduct for the TNCs are desirable, the crucial determinant of the effectiveness of host governments in dealing with TNCs will be their ability to formulate and implement deliberate and carefully worked out strategies in relation to the TNCs, both at the policy and the negotiating levels. The paper examines some of the first order policy issues which deserve to be considered by the underdeveloped countries which already have, or propose to have, transactions with TNCs in order to develop their industrial base.||Samuel Paul

27/1/1979- ||special articles||4367302||Towards a Study of Education and Social Change||The sociology of knowledge may throw light on some of the perplexing aspects of the relationship between education and social change. For instance, the role of the educated Indians in the national movement for Independence has been outlined time and again, but this remains an impressionistic observation. The role of the content of curriculum, the organisation and the transmission of knowledge may give us more reliable and interesting data. More research ought therefore to be undertaken by sociologists in this hitherto unexplored area. This will also enable us to distinguish between social changes at the structural level and those at the level of ideas, values or attitudes or what the author calls 'ideational' change. Structural changes are more likely to be generated by politico-economic factors and ideational change can bring about stability in such a situation.||Karuna Ahmad

Furthermore, as this paper shows for Poona, even sites and services schemes, if provided to the prescribed standards for all the incremental population, would at present exhaust an unacceptable proportion of the budget. If the skewed distribution of these basic amenities is to be avoided, new organisation and building techniques have to be envisaged. Arguably the potential for such innovations can already be seen.||Meera Bapat,Nigel Crook
18/8/1979- ||special articles||4367850||Studies of Educated Working Women in India: Trends and Issues||Studies on Indian women generally assume that better educational and employment opportunities are fundamental to any improvement in the status of women. There is, however, little objective basis to warrant such an assumption; for one thing, women in rural areas as well as urban women from economically weaker sections have always laboured hard, and yet their status has always been low. This paper briefly surveys the dominant trends in the employment of working women in India and argues that what is called for is a new orientation of the research into the question of working women. Since sex-related attributes are rooted in social structure, the contention of the paper is that studies of women in India have to be more contextual than has been traditionally the case, if they are to be relevant.||Karuna Ahmad

29/9/1979- ||review of agriculture, september 1979||4367993||Farm Prices and Class Bias in India||This paper questions the following propositions. (a) that the terms of trade have moved in favour of agriculture; (b) that high foodgrain prices go against the interests of landless labourers and small farmers; and (c) that the government's price policy is influenced by the 'kulak lobby'. Part I of the paper argues that the data base for the first proposition is not adequate as the official price indices tend to over-represent price changes in agriculture and under-represent changes in manufacture. In Part II the relative price position of agricultural commodities vis-a-vis manufactures is examined to show that this provides no evidence of a shift in the relative price position in favour of agriculture. In Part III the question "do high agricultural prices militate against landless labourers and small farmers?" is examined. Part IV deals with relative returns to labour and capital in agriculture and the rest of the economy. In the final section it is argued that there is an in-built bias that does not allow farm prices to rise sufficiently.||D. S. Tyagi

First, we take a sort of an historical overview of the situation in 1947, and then outline the shifts that have occurred since then in the relative positions and strengths of the various economic and socio-political forces. Later, we analyse the manner in which they are now operating in the developing situation and discuss the important issues involved.||A. R. Kamat

The programme moving at a slow pace in the 1950s and the 1960s, has been accelerated in the 1970s, and much effort has gone to improve the coverage and efficiency of the programme. This paper attempts to examine the contribution of animal husbandry and dairy development programmes to the increase of milk production in Kerala. Its chief findings are: (1) that there has been a considerable increase in the productivity of milch animals and total milk production in Kerala; (2) that the profitability of milk production has gone up over the years; and (3) that milk production in Kerala is mainly undertaken by small and marginal farmers. The paper also makes some broad projections of the demand for milk and milk products by 1990 and concludes that a mere programme of improved cross-breeding cannot possibly meet the projected demands. The paper briefly touches upon the recent demands for a ban on the slaughter of cows in Kerala and argues that there is no economic rationale behind such a demand. Any ban on the slaughter of cows in the state would be totally harmful to the growth of the livestock economy; and would surely affect adversely several development projects already undertaken.||K.

Agrarian revolution is the core of the current stage of the revolution in India. While it is oriented towards elimination of the vestiges of feudalism, it is not aimed against agricultural capitalism as such. But the agrarian revolution does demand the abolition of landlordism - both feudal and capitalist. Unless the poor peasants and agricultural labourers are organised and united to carry forward the revolution to the next stage, landlordism in one form or another will reassert itself.||Ranjit Sau

According to one estimate, not less than 1.20 lakh workers, male and female, are engaged in making hand-moulded bricks in the state. Since no brick kiln employs more than 20 persons at a time, brick-making is considered a cottage industry. There is rigid compartmentalisation of work on the basis of sex in the brick industry. Women are employed exclusively for carrying head-loads, while all skilled and semi-skilled work, such as moulding, shaping, stacking, etc, is done exclusively by men. As a result, women's wages, for work which is not physically less exhausting than that done by men, are only about half those earned by men. Nevertheless, women cling to the brick industry because of the uncertainty of work opportunities elsewhere and the continuity of employment which brick work offers. This is the story of a middle-aged, untouchable woman brick-worker, Jayamma, her work and her family.||Leela Gulati

These retrograde developments are increasing rural poverty, unemployment, and inequalities of incomes and wealth. Data relating to these are discussed in Part I. Institutional finance, if properly used for rural capital formation and growth, would have been a corrective to these trends. Part II highlights the inadequacy of institutional finance from the point of view of the estimated rural credit requirements in the country. The relative importance of various agencies supplying institutional finance is also assessed in terms of branch network, deposits mobilised, finance provided, etc. Part III sets out the concentration of institutional finance, state-wise and asset-group-wise. This throws light on the inadequate provision of finance to weaker sections of the rural population and in the underdeveloped regions. This part also attempts to examine whether and to what extent institutional finance was responsible for the greater inequalities in income and wealth among the various strata of rural people.||V. A.

Beginning with the British and some princes long before Independence and continuing to the present day, such treatment has been the principal means of addressing the problems of the lowest ranking castes and the tribal populations. Today its suitability and effectiveness in addressing these last problems are the subject of both street violence and constitutional debate. "Who really benefits?" it is asked. "What price is paid, and who pays it?" "Is there any better way of addressing the problems?" These are only some of the questions being argued and to which I would like to contribute some observations in this paper. In making my observations, I will be drawing on two bodies of material: the history of the Non-Brahmin movement and Backward Class provisions in the former Princely State of Mysore during the three decades before Independence, and the present-day provisions for the Scheduled Castes in India as a whole.||Lelah Dushkin

These changes are in the direction of modernisation and an increasing role for the secondary and tertiary sectors. Nevertheless, the Indian economy continues to be dominated by the primary sector and by unorganised enterprises. The most startling feature of the structural change is the failure of the occupational structure to coincide with the sectoral net domestic product structure. It is this which needs further probe as well as quest for remedial measures.||V. K. R. V. Rao

26/5/1979- ||special articles||4367635||Small Farmer Development||The economic philosophy which led up to the launching of the Small Farmer Development Agency (SFDA) scheme in 1971 is simply that special preferential arrangements are necessary for the supply of inputs to small farmers because the markets for inputs (and particularly credit which is the precondition for access to all material inputs and equipment) are imperfect and non-neutral. They discriminate systematically against the small producers both in respect of the quantity of inputs (credit) supplied to them as well as the price at which (or more generally the terms on which) they are made available to them in comparison with larger farmers. Even the establishment of a vast State-supported co-operative network, and the nationalisation of commercial banks did not automatically reduce this discrimination. Therefore, the planners concluded eight years ago that special agencies of small farmers were needed to lobby for them even with nationalised and co-operative institutions. Since seven years of experimentation have elapsed, it is essential to review the philosophy and the performance of the SFDA set-up. This paper offers some evaluative reflections on the SFDA approach and some suggestions for its further evolution.||Raj Krishna

The scope of decision-making at each level of planning will depend, however, upon the objectives of planning at that level within the overall objectives of the organisation, considerations of administrative and economic efficiency, and the constraints of the political system. As the Draft Five-Year Plan has put it, "It is possible that there should be a hierarchy of planning decisions at different levels".||B. P. R. Vithal

1/8/1979- ||------||4367816||Monopoly Capital, Private Corporate Sector and the Indian Economy: A Study in Relative Growth, 1931-76||India has never been through a period of competitive capitalism. In the past foreign dominations, feudal relations in agriculture, lack of incentive for domestic industries, and the existence, often with the encouragement of the colonial power, of a host of monopolies (local, regional or national) in trade and finance, constituted effective barriers to the emergence of capitalism. The end of direct colonial rule and the formal abolition of landlordism in the post-independence era did not signify a radical break with the past. Neo-colonial exploitation of the country continues unabated, while a muted form of feudalism or semi-feudalism predominates in the rural areas. The purchasing power of the masses remains as low as ever, so that there is no scope whatsoever for a sustained industrial upsurge. With an eye to quick profits and control over the labour process, monpoly capital, which was already well-entrenched, found contemporary Western technology much too attractive, even if in the process industrial employment and the size of the home market got narrower, and the country became financially and technologically more dependent on the major foreign powers. Moreover, monopolists in India have generally been able to retain or expand their market power not so much by superior economic efficiency, but by controlling the supply of raw materials and intermadiates through their intimate links with the State machinery at various levels, restrictive selling practices designed to shut out smaller firms, and an easy access to cheap institutional finance. For all these reasons, monopoly capital in India bears a closer family resemblance to pre-industrial monopolies than to contemporary monopoly capitalism in the West, and constitutes, along with semi-feudalism and neo-colonialism, one of the major obstacles to the transformation of India along capitalist lines.||N.

In its struggle the peasantry faced a historically developed landlord class, powerful not merely by its land monopoly but further strengthened by caste - a structure of social relations which was closely adapted to the class structure and yet retained its own dimensions of oppression. The manner in which the Thanjavur peasants and bonded labourers were historically bound by these structures and the experience of their struggle against them is significant for the development of the democratic movement in India.||Saraswathi Menon

But what is distinctive about the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) is that foreign companies are gaining through faithful implementation of the provisions of the Act. Violation of the Act's provisions, by taking advantage of loopholes or otherwise, has not been necessary. This paper discusses the background, the declared objectives and the legal provisions of FERA, the guidelines announced for administering section 29 of the Act, the problems of implementation and the impact of FERA on the operation of the foreign corporate sector in India. The discussion leads to the following conclusions: (i) No inbuilt legal bias against foreign capit al has been introduced through FERA. A section of the foreign corporate sector has in fact been excluded from the purview of the Act. (ii) The hold of foreign firms over the corporate sector will be strengthened as a result of the implementation of FERA. Indian portfolio investors who participate in the share capital of foreign companies may benefit, but the benefit is likely to be limited, if the foreign firms now declare less dividends and repatriate a higher proportion of profits through other means such as, for instance, transfer pricing. (iii) The foreign exchange outflow resulting from expansion of foreign companies is likely to increase.||Sudip Chaudhuri

07/7/1979- ||special articles||4367762||Electricity for Development: Problems and Prospects in Equipment Acquisition||Developing countries are facing serious problems in their programmes for expansion of electric power supply. Above all, their extreme dependence on foreign technologies has serious socio-economic implications. The foreign exchange components of Third World investment in electric power capacity, on average about 50 per cent, implies an aggregate foreign exchange drain of more than $ 180,000 million before the end of this century, for the purpose of electrification alone. As a result of this, other fields for public investment will undoubtedly be starved of needed funds. Furthermore, the developing countries' financial difficulties in meeting their steadily growing demand for electricity will hamper industrial growth and expansion. At the same time, a continuation of import of electrical equipment seems unavoidable for the Third World countries, regardless of their choice of techniques for meeting the electricity demand. There are three major reasons for this: (1) Too small domestic markets make indigenous production of the needed equipment and power facilities unprofitable also in socio-economic terms. (2) Lack of knowhow and technological capabilities hinders domestic production of such equipment. (3) Innovative activities in the energy field are concentrated to a small number of industrial countries and transnational corporations. Two policy conclusions can immediately be drawn: (1) One of the worst things a developing country can do at present is to go in for building nuclear power stations. This would considerably aggravate the already dismal situation regarding balance of payments deficit and foreign dependence. Since very few developing countries can meet the requirement of an appropriate indigenous supportive technological environment, the extravagance of nuclear techniques is too expensive an endeavour. (2) Since imports are inescapable, the only appropriate thing developing countries can do is to increase, step by step, their influence over the terms and conditions of purchases of electrical equipment from external sources. In doing this a strategy for the strengthening of the bargaining position in technology transfer is needed.||Hans Gustafsson

The unprecedented violence that has accompanied the implementation of this policy might last for a while, but the process itself is irreversible. This article attempts to relate the emergence of these 'middle castes' into a position of political power in the state to the continuing process of disintegration of semi-feudal production relations in Bihar. It argues that the farming of caste passions which on earlier occasions had led to a diffusion of class contradictions may now turn out to be a factor which may in fact sharpen and intensify these contradictions.||Pradhan H.

1/8/1979- ||------||4367817||Indian Planning in the Eighties||An attempt is made in this paper to (a) estimate employment in the Indian economy in 1977-78 (the base year of the Draft Plan, 1978-83); (b) estimate the relationship between output growth and employment growth on a sectoral basis; (c) examine the employment potential of the development effort on certain 'reasonable' assumptions of alternative growth possibilities in the future; and (d) introduce considerations of alternative regional development categories in the agricultural sector and of institutional change, particularly land reforms, and examine their impact on the generation of employment potential. It is important, the author concludes, to measure employment at a disaggregative level in juxtaposition with the income criterion, because otherwise the nexus of employment policies with output growth, investment priorities and distribution of gains cannot be created. From the conceptual and policy viewpoints, it is also useful to view the category of the employed and poor, asoperating at differential income levels within the categorisation, so that policies can be derived for each level. While a rural works programme will have to be an important component of the investment programme, efforts will need to be made to integrate it with the development effort, since such a programme can absorb almost the entire increase in the savings of the economy at current levels. Special efforts will need to be made to adopt technologies and institutions for the poor and to mobilise local resource potentials, since even dynamic growth of the national economy along the desired lines is incapable of generating sufficient productive employment. A high rate of output in the non-agricultural and organised sectors is desirable and possible and does not, appropriately designed, conflict with the employment generation objective.||Yoginder K.

But the type of financial intermediation that has grown in India during the last two decades is not entirely on sound lines. Ever growing dependence of the private sector on debt capital supplied by public sector financial intermediaries is not a healthy developoment. The household sector's preference has been increasingly in favour of acquiring financial assets in the form of deposits with commercial banks. For ensuring healthy trends in the growth of the private sector, larger direct equity participation by the household sector needs to be encouraged. If borrowed funds are made costlier, by not allowing interest payments as a deductible item along with other manufacturing costs, there will be a tendency for the private corporate sector to rely less on borrowed funds, thereby enabling the financial institutions to support a large size of investment activity with the resources at their disposal.||R.

This article, a broad historical survey of the Marathi film industry, examines the ideas and ideals that have inspired the makers of Marathi films before Independence and since then. During this period of political changes at the national level, important changes were taking place in the Marathi film industry too. The centre of the Marathi film industry moved from Kolhapur to Poona and finally to Bombay, the seat of the far more influential Hindi film industry; its financial backing too was gradually taken over by the same interests which financed the Hindi film industry; and there was also a distinct shift in the composition of the audience for these films. The article delineates these changes and attempts to relate them to the changes in the content of the Marathi films - from the mythological episodes purporting to be allegories of nationalist struggle against British rule that characterised the themes of many Marathi films of pre-Independence times to the idealised portrait of virile Marathi virtues of 'rural' (gramin) life that is a feature of much of present-day Marathi fiilms.||Pramod Kale
1/8/1979- ||------||4367818||Trends in Agriculture in India, 1949-50-1977-78||There has been a decline in the rate of growth of gross sown area, in particular under non-food crops, in the decade starting from 1967-68 compared to the fifteen years ending in 1964-65, but the output (and yield per unit of area) of food crops and all crops grew more or less uniformly over the entire period 1949-50 to 1977-78 with no evidence of either acceleration or deceleration since 1967-68. The slow down in the growth of crop area in the period after the mid-1960s compared to the earlier period is shared by almost all crops except wheat. Among cereals, the so-called coarse grains, namely, jowar, maize and bajra, actually lost area in the decade starting from 1967-78. It is again wheat which shows faster growth in output and yield per unit area in the later decade compared to the earlier decade and a half. There is as yet no evidence for such a change in growth of output or yield per unit of area of rice, though jowar yields seem to have grown faster in the later period. In other words, there is as yet no green revolution but still only a wheat revolution.||T. N. Srinivasan

The reason for this, despite the acceptance of a more equitable formula for distributing the Central excise, is the much greater dependence on tax-shares than on grants. There is a conflict here between two principles. From many standpoints, it is desirable to give the states as much as possible through the tax-shares, but as long as uniform rules are applied for allocating the tax receipts, large inequalities are likely. Grants on the other hand are fixed and they may be used as equalisers. There has to be a compromise between the two extremes. This means that the Planning Commission will have to start where the Finance Commission has ended. If an equitable distribution is wanted as a final result, then, as a minimum condition, the Plan plus non-plan expenditure on the developmental services per person below the poverty line should be the same all over the country. This is yet far from being achieved and the Seventh Finance Commission has shifted the full responsibility to the Planning Commission.||Bhabatosh Datta

What can be attempted is to moderate the average variations in its exchange rates and thereby reduce the impact of exchange rate variations originating from oxogenous factors on its trade and payments. Though theoretically there are many alternative exchange rate arrangements to choose from, in practice the choice of an appropriate exchange rate for the rupee narrows to a peg to a selected multi-currency basket or a peg to economic indicators or a combination of both. However, the basket link has the potential danger of diverting our attention from the need for constant review and revision of the rates to ensure that the level of the exchange rate is consistent with the objective needs of the economy. With the basket link if we use the dollar as the basis for the valuation of the basket and the intervention currency, not only can the frequency of adjustment of exchange rate of rupee against the intervention currency be minimised but greater stability can be imparted in the daily and short-run rates in the rupee-dollar rate which will benefit the bulk of India's trade and other payments which are invoiced in the dollar.||S.

It is necessary to separate class contradictions from non-class contradictions, to separate real contradictions from false contradictions, and to reduce various kinds of contradictions to the basic one. The problem is highly complex. It is related to the nature of the socio-economic formation, to the dialectic relationship between base and superstructure, to the historic role caste associations have played and to the political perspective the left political parties have written down in their programmes. The former two aspects should theoretically reveal the extent to which caste has been transcended by class, both economically and socially. The latter two aspects should throw some light on how caste and class organisations relate to each other in practice.||Georges Kristoffel Lieten
25/8/1979- ||special articles||4367878||Employment, Income and Food Intake among Agricultural Labour Households||Authors have drawn different conclusions about trends in real wage rates of agricultural labour in India, depending on the source of data on wage rates of male agricultural labour, the terminal years used for the comparisons, the index numbers used for deflating money wages, and so on. From such conclusions, some writers have even ventured to draw inferences about changes in the condition of agricultural labourers as a whole. Clearly, the level of income is more important than the wage rate and the level of employment is a crucial determinant of income and level of living. Data on employment and earnings of agricultural labourers are scanty. Researchers should, therefore, attempt to fill this gap rather than continue the interminable debate on trends in real wage rates. An attempt is made in this paper to study the level of employment, income and food intake among selected agricultural labour househods in Kuttanad, the 'rice bowl' of Kerala.||P. G. K. Panikar
21/7/1979- ||special articles||4367805||Industrial Houses, Multinationals and Industrial Policy||In formulating policy towards industrial houses, the various industrial policy statements have, by and large, ignored the heterogeneous character of different firms belonging to an industrial house and the possibility of these firms pursuing different objectives because they operate in different market structures characterised by monopoly, oligopoly or competition. This paper, on the basis of a study of a sample of companies belonging to the business houses of Birla and Tata, attempts to test the hypothesis that the different firms belonging to these two business houses operating in different market structures behave differently with regard to growth of assets and profits. The policy implications of this hypothesis are important, as, if the objectives of the firms are determined by the market structures in which they operate, then a uniform policy towards heterogeneous firms belonging to a business house is not meaningful. The paper also presents certain findings on the growth and profitability of multinational firms in the engineering industries and analyses their implications for industrial policy.||N. S. Siddharthan

Under British rule, this feudal society was rapidly transformed into a semi-feudal state, with considerable changes in the social structure. In British and post-independence periods, several land regulation and land reform measures have been enacted which too have brought about further changes. An attempt is made in this paper to show how developments in post-independence Assam have brought about changes in agrarian relations, with a view to showing the emerging pattern in rural Assam.||Ranajit K.

19/5/1979- ||special articles||4367612||Agrarian Relations in a Khasi State||The office of the Syiem among the Khasi people, even though now considerably shorn of its previous glories, is nevertheless of considerable importance and potential gain to the holder. It is not accidental that the person aiming for the office has to belong to one or other of a few select clans, and the members of the 'electoral college' which elects the Syiem comprise mostly of Khasi nobility. This account of agrarian relations in a Khasi 'state' begins with a brief account of the administrative system of the Khasis and then goes on to detail the system of land tenure prevalent in the Syiemship of the territory of Maharam in the Khasi Hills. A careful scrutiny of the finer nuances and the actual working of the system of land tenure in Maharam reveals that a very large area of even 'common land', of which the Syiem is supposed to be only the custodian, is managed by the Syiem in virtually the same manner in which he and his clansmen manage Ri Kynti, land which is in exclusive possession of the Syiem. The increasing destitution of the Khasi poor cannot be laid (as it is often done) at the door of the traditional law of female untimogeniture, for an archaic matrilineal inheritance could never have survived if it had gone against Khasi nobility; instead, the roots of such destitution are inherent in the traditions, laws and practices that govern the control and ownership of land.||Bani Prasanna Misra

The author argues that indiscriminate promotion of small-scale industry, defined merely in terms of size of capital, need not result in increased employment or the most efficient use of scarce resources like capital and land. Very important factors like consumer interest, market linkage, the efficient use of resources and the need for innovation necessitate the continued growth of large-scale industry. The role of the small-scale sector has, therefore, to be seen as complementary to that of the large-scale one and not one of exclusive dominance in a widening range of activities.||T. Thomas

The 1980s, the author suggests, will see the theoretical frontiers of the discipline being extended; and the discipline will also play a greater role in the task of national reconstruction, planning and policy formation.||M.

(1) There will be a severe shortage of feed and forages in India during the period 1978-79 to 1984-85. The severity of the shortages will increase with the increase in the numbers of cross-bred milch cattle. (2) The acreage requirements for meeting the feed and fodder deficits are exceedingly large, and will increase at a very high rate. (3) The feed and fodder scarcity will hit small farmers the hardest. The prospects of benefits to the landless through the Operation Flood II programmes are bleak. (4) As in the case of HYV field crops, the gains of the cross-breeding programme are likely to be confined to comparatively well irrigated regions.||Surendar Singh

They are living social groups whose attitudes and responses are determined by historical and cultural factors. The materialistic interpretation of history does not imply an exclusive emphasis on the economic factor to the comparative neglect of others. The purpose of formulating a social theory is to understand the attitudes and responses of different social groups to particular programmes. Any simplistic all-India generalisations about the mode of production and the nature of social classes, though essential, are bound to be inadequate. For them to be realistic and purposeful, they have to be based on detailed studies of the specific social structure in the different regions of India. This paper attempts to analyse the changing nature of caste relations and their significance for class conflict and social change in Maharashtra over the last 150 years.||Nalini Pandit

This paper seeks to examine and review critically the various stages in the development of the concepts and practices of accounting for changing prices. It concludes with a case study of the managerial uses, by an Indian firm, of one of the suggested inflation-adjustments methods.||Ramesh Gupta

This is especially so in agriculture. This article attempts to understand the process of transformation of agriculture which accompanied the industrialisation of the now advanced economies. It underscores that, without a historical understanding of the phases and environment of that transformation, transfers of technologies to the developing countries tend to be mechanical, inequitous, and poorly integrated into the political economies of these countries.||P.

There is, however, no unanimity of opinion about what constitutes money and what is the correct specification of the rate of interest. In a dualistic developing economy, in which money rates are generally administered, a particularly serious problem is specifying an appropriate rate of interest. This note attempts to use a concept of the rate of return hitherto not tried while examining the demand for money in India.||A. Vasuvedan

Two questions are pertinent in this context. First, what are the economic differentiations within a caste, and how do they cut across the castes both vertically and horizontally? Secondly, to what extent does the ritual status of a caste and a sense of fraternity among the caste members blurs economic differentiations, and sustains a false consciousness? The present paper, based on observations of a single tribe in Gujarat, endeavours to answer these questions with the help of empirical data.||Ghanshyam Shah

Secondly, to measure the strength of two factors which may account for the trend: (1) the success of the Green Revolution technology in raising farm productivity, and (2) the remarkable influx of workers into the agricultural labour force. Part I deals with real wage rates in Punjab as a whole from 1961 to 1977. Part II covers the same ground for each district separately. In Part III, the impact of rising farm productivity, and of rising prices, on real wage rates, is measured separately, for the period 1961 to 1977, for Punjab as a whole. Finally, in Part IV, the labour supply factor is brought in. The joint impact on real wages of farm productivity and number of agricultural workers, as measured by labour productivity, is examined for two trienniums - 1962 to 1965 and 1970 to 1973 - using cross-section data for each of the two periods. The paper ends with a list of questions which need to be answered in the interests of a fuller explanation of variations in real wage rates in Punjab.||Sheila Bhalla

It traces the way in which the concrete and qualitative reciprocities that characterised the relationships of primitive peasant societies in the Hill Tracts have been replaced by the abstract and quantitative exchange relations of the market. This process of the disintegration of the pre-colonial culture and economy of the Hill Tracts and its integration into the larger market of the State has brought along with it certain problems, including the highlighting of the internal divisions within the Hill Tracts society; these are briefly touched upon towards the end of the article.||B.

First is the category of information classified under sruti which has been handed down from one generation to the next with clearly built-in safeguards to reduce, if not obviate, corruption and distortion in course of transmission. Second is that category which can be said to comprise a much looser corpus of material permitting of expansion and incorporation of new material over periods of time. Itihasik and pauranic materials, as also relevant manifestations of folk culture, may be included in this group. For purposes of convenience a further distinction may be made between Hindu sacred knowledge as defined under sruti and smriti and traditional craft and technical knowledge. A third category may be postulated, viz, oral testimony relating to pockets of Indian society transformed by currents generated by modernity while remaining bound to the umbilical cord emanating from the previous cultural mould. The first portion of this paper relates to the first two categories, while the third aspect is briefly dwelt upon in its concluding part.||Lotika Varadarajan

For the Pathan, colonisation meant destroyed villages, water tanks and grain stores; it meant electrified fences, block houses and unending series of 'butcher and bolt' raids. When the British finally left in 1947, the legacy they left behind did not consist of schools or colleges or such other symbols of development, but of repressive institutions like Frontier Scouts and Constabulary. The barrenness of the colonial encounter in the Frontier is in notable contrast to that in Bengal, across the sub-continent, or even across the Indus in the Punjab. Nevertheless, the Pathan-British encounter has been permeated with a strong element of 'romance' which is reflected in the memoirs and accounts left by the British as well as in the creative works by writers like Kipling - though the Pathan himself has never been able to see the noble and romantic aspects of the encounter. This article examines the causal factors that led to the mystification of the colonial encounter, and the social and political needs that such mystification fulfilled.||Akbar S. Ahmed

And unfortunately very little of it has touched on the subject of reserved seats in legislatures. For purposes of deciding whether reserved seats should be extended or terminated, the collection and analysis of data about their performance is only a first (though essential) step. The policy decision involves at least three major sorts of questions beyond the estimation of costs and benefits up-till now. First, once a pattern of costs and benefits is ascertained, there is the question of whether it can be expected to continue in the future. Second, since the goals and dangers of the compensatory discrimination policy are multiple, an evaluation of costs and benefits requires that some kind of weights and priorities be assigned to these goals or dangers. These can be supplied only by a vision of a future society that unites the desirable with the possible. Third, evaluation must be comparative. Acceptance or rejection of the package of benefits and costs believed to be associated with reserved seats must be compared with the costs as well as the benefits anticipated to arise from any alternative that is believed to be preferable.||Marc Galanter

Large investments cannot be avoided. Computations in this article show that, for India to attain its objectives in steel, the ratio of BF + LD to DR + EF capacity would have to be approximately 70:30, if not higher. One could begin long-term planning on such a broad premise, and periodically revise it in the light of new developments such as the discovery of new coking coal mines in Dhanbad and Birbhum districts, discovery and availability of natural gas, electric power generation and availability, etc. It will, of course have to be ensured that vested interests of the one or the other route do not foreclose a periodic review of the choice of technology.||S.

Yet, the present usage of the concept is not without ambiguity. This article attempts to expose the ambiguity in the usage of the concept in present-day sociology and seeks to show that the recent vogue of the concept has little to do with its history. Accordingly, the first part of the article (Sections I-III) reviews the current theoretical meanings and empirical studies linked with the concept. Sections IV-VI turn to Marxian formulations for a richer and more relevant guidance. In both cases, the effort is to study the concept of alienation in the context of our general concern, that is, working class consciousness in capitalist society.||Surendra Munshi

In this paper an attempt is made to segregate the effect of various capacity and effort factors on changes in tax revenues. Specifically, the author attempts to examine and quantify: (i) the effect of various economic factors, both capacity and effort, on changes over time in individual tax revenues as well as aggregate tax revenues of the states; (ii) the effect of political factors, particularly the influence of ideological leanings of the parties in power and the impact of political stability considerations on the states' fiscal outcomes; (iii) the behaviour of the additional tax efforts put in by the states over different development plans.||M.

On the basis of these findings the author analyses the village moneylenders' management of debt liabilities as they have developed from traditional credit relationships. The author's account of traditional credit markets shows that the motive behind private moneylending is primarily to create social obligations rather than to gain direct profit from interest payments. This objective is achieved by exploiting agricultural labourers-cum-debtors who are underpaid or even unpaid. The management of debt relationships as instanced by the mechanism of debt-farming gives ample evidence of this kind of exploitation.||Hans-Dieter Roth
29/9/1979- ||review of agriculture, september 1979||4367992||Agricultural Prices, Production and Growth||Price and tax policies are important instruments which can be used to allocate existing resources, create new resources, induce or discourage technological changes, etc. Agricultural prices (and taxes) are one means by which resources can be transferred from the large agricultural sector to the growing non-agricultural sector. This article recapitulates the government's policy regarding agricultural prices and also touches on the problem of distribution - the maintenance of buffer stocks and the creation of a public distribution system, which in theory is supposed to benefit the poorest consumers, but which in practice does not. The article argues for a production-oriented price policy which would include a short-run goal of stability in relative crop prices, a medium-run goal of stability in the terms of trade for agriculture to encourage the spread of new technology and investment in agriculture, and a long-run goal of gradual adjustment of all prices towards their equilibrium level which, with the agriculture modernised, would mean a turn in the terms of trade and a transfer of resources to the non-agricultural sector.||S.

The author attempts to distinguish the different groups that would be affected by the project, their respective net gains, and how they affect considerations of social profitability. This attempt at a cost-benefit analysis specifically views the project from the point of view of its benefits and costs at market prices, its impact on farmers, labourers and poorer sections, and in terms of regional development and larger social values.||K.

It describes a pilot project, still under implementation at the time of writing, designed to investigate these advantages, and discusses results observed so far on the basis of preliminary cost data. The question of scale economies is discussed in some detail. It also discusses the economic or social viability of a biogas based decentralised energy system such as this one and the charges that might have to be levied to achieve financial viability. The last part of the paper attempts to assess the role of such a system is meeting rural energy needs, especially for irrigation pumping, when viewed in relation to the electricity and diesel alternatives.||P.

It does so using multiple regression with dummy variables. Taking a sample from the 1971 Special Census on Degree Holders and Technical Personnel, first an attempt is made to study (a) the incidence and (b) duration of unemployment by detailed tabulations; and secondly the duration of unemployment is further analysed by fitting an unemployment function. The results support the following findings: (i) given a comparable length of exposure to education, the duration of unemployment varies significantly among the different categories of professional manpower (viz, scientists, engineers, doctors and agricultural and veterinary scientists); (ii) in each category the duration of unemployment is less among those with higher academic performance than those with lower academic performance; and (iii) the females face a longer duration of unemployment compared to the males.||K.

08/12/1979- ||special articles||4368204||Bangladesh: Anatomy of a Coup||When, on the night of August 14, 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was killed alongwith a large numbers of members of his family and friends, it was put out that the assassins had acted on their own, with no larger political objective than of ridding the country of a tyrant. Unspecific talk about 'foreign involvement' in the assassination or, more explicitly, of CIA involvement, was, on the basis of evidence available then, rightly dismissed as specious propaganda. These conclusions made immediately in the wake of the coup need to be now completely re-examined. According to new information obtained from interviews with senior US embassy officials then in Dacca, well-informed Bengali sources, and from official documents available in the US now consequent upon the Freedom of Information Act, it appears that not only did the US have prior knowledge of the coup, but that American embassy personnel had discussed possibilities of a coup more than six months earlier. But the links of the conspirators with the US do not date merely to the period immediately preceding the coup; they go back to the days of the provisional government of Bangladesh functioning from Calcutta in 1971. This article lays bare the anatomy of the coup. The article is being published in two parts. It begins with an account of the 'received version' of the coup, and goes on to describe how the 'majors', in claiming to have acted entirely on their own, were perhaps themselves not completely aware of how they were being used by domestic and foreign reaction. For the United States, the civil war in East Pakistan was an annoying distraction (an even more minor 'sideshow' than Cambodia) when it was engaged, via Pakistan's good offices, in establishing the first links with China; and the US never forgave Mujibur Rahman for prevailing, with Indian and Soviet help, over US annoyance. But Mujib too invited the coup. Unable to fulfil the expectations he had demagogically raised, and in order to contain radical opposition to his increasingly oppressive regime, he began to depend on repressive state machinery which had not merely been linked closely to Pakistan, but which was, in its training and ideology, equally close to the United States, having been nourished by the US AID's office of Public Safety programme - a programme of training of police forces from third world countries begun by the US in 1955 and wound up only in July 1975, following strong criticism within the US. Part Two, which will be published next week, describes the way in which Mujib, increasingly out of touch with reality towards the end of his career, became a victim of his own creation.||Lawrence Lifschultz,Kai Bird

It is especially important in states where landholdings are small. Assets held are more evenly distributed in relation to land area cultivated only for medium farmers, while they are unevenly distributed in the small and large-sized holdings. There is also uneveness among the states - asset value per hectare of land being higher in those states where the proportion of irrigated area is more, and being directly related to variations in yields per hectare. If crop yields in backward regions are to rise, institutional reforms aimed at more even distribution of land and non-land assets appear to be as important as public investment in irrigation and fertiliser production.||H.

The present study, pertaining to two villages in the Chengalpattu district of Tamil Nadu, hopes to bridge this gap and to formulate certain hypotheses showing the historical and contemporary interlinkage between these categories.||S.

25/8/1979- ||review of management, august 1979||4367872||Workers' Needs and Expectations and Strategies of Motivation: The Indian Case||While it is agreed that the motivation of Indian workers for work is low, opinion is divided on the question of how to increase it. While some scholars have stressed the need for adequate satisfaction of workers' primary needs, others have advocated for satisfaction of workers' higher order needs through participative work redesign. This paper examines the sources of these prescriptions and their limitations and argues on the basis of data from one industrial centre that the prescriptions emanate from an inadequate understanding of workers' needs and expectations. If workers' motivation is to be improved, then their perceptions of the social reality which strongly influence their needs and expectations will have to be changed. These would call for macro level changes in the economy and society. In the absence of these changes, the impact of the micro level motivational strategies is likely to be minimal.||Anil K. Sengupta

For the less-developed regions in the country, the strategy to maximise growth through regional development may need to dominate while a direct attack on Poverty may have to be given priority in some of the developed regions. Structural changes may become a necessary pre-requisite in certain other regions for stimulating growth as well as for ensuring better distribution. Moreover, all the three strategies seem to underplay the vital role of factors such as entrepreneurship, administration, constraints and possibilities arising from the particular cultural framework, the bargaining power of the less-developed regions and of the less-privileged groups, etc. Therefore, an understanding of the characteristic features of different regions of the country may be necessary for identifying strategies and policies suitable to different regions and for incorporating further useful elements into the known strategies.||C.

1/2/1979- ||dialectical relationships||4367353||Caste, Class and Property Relations||Nationalist tradition in India looked upon the struggle of the lower castes against the domination of the upper castes as a diversion from the general anti-imperialist struggle. The caste question was considered to be an internal affair of the Indians who, in spite of all the differences and inequalities among them, were expected to first fight for the freedom of the country, under the leadership of the bourgeoisie. At the same time, there was another current which held that India was unfit for freedom till the people first overcame the inequalities of the caste system. This current was represented by certain social reformers coming from upper castes whose bourgeois democratic consciousness was appalled by the monstrous iniquities of the caste system and other obscenities of Hinduism. In essence, both these traditions sought to delink the anti-caste struggles from the contemporary democratic and class struggles; they sought to circumscribe the anti-caste struggle within the framework of the existing political and economic system. The present article makes a broad survey of both these traditions and argues that while anti-caste struggles, even when they apparently take on the form of a demand for reservation of jobs, etc, should be supported, what is called for is a deeper struggle, embracing the oppressed of all castes, against the present socio-economic system which is based on certain property and production relations which sustain both caste and class oppression.||B.

21/7/1979- ||special articles||4367807||Historical Roots of the Crisis of Calcutta, 1876-1939||It is generally assumed that the Congress party in pre-independence Bengal was entirely the captive organisation of Calcutta-based politicians. Much of the research work done on the inter-relationship between the Congress in the city and in the hinterland highlights the malignant influence of vested city interests who deliberately excluded rural leaders from important positions in the Congress machine. Such a reading, however, misses one important element of municipal politics in Calcutta - the severe conflict between European business interests and Indian aspirations. Indeed, the unpublished proceedings of the European Association of Calcutta leave no doubt that such a conflict was objectively the deepest current underlying Calcutta politics and was perceived as such by European businessmen in Calcutta. This paper attempts to explore the theme of growing antagonisms of the Congress and the non-official Europeans in the Corporation of Calcutta, together with two related themes: the factional divisions within the Congress party in the Corporation, and the increasing alienation of the Muslim councillors from the Congress. The divisions within the ranks of the Congress prevented the adoption of a unified and constructive policy of satisfying Muslim aspirations; and the European counterattack, in turn, seized on Hindu-Muslim antagonisms as the main lever of manipulation.||Rajat K.

1/2/1979- ||dialectical relationships||4367349||Dialectics of Caste and Class Conflicts||The transition from the non-hereditary varna to the hereditary jati marks the transition from the early tribal slave societies to the feudal societies before India was colonised. This article traces that process in some detail. Jati or caste did then represent class defined in terms of relation to land, expropriation of its surplus, and military and bureaucratic sharing of wealth and power. With colonial society, new class relations came into being. In the basically mercantile economy the urban bourgeoisie, big and small, merged with the rural class of rentier landlords as the creditor became de facto landlord and the debtor a permanent serf. Naturally, the rentier was a vehement protagonist of the varna jati dharma or ideology, ever to underpin the changing economic and political base. It should be emphasised that the ruling classes of capitalists and landlords and their parties increasingly rely on caste and religious support in the race for parliamentary power. Given the composition of Indian society, socialism cannot be achieved without peasant agrarian revolution. And it is in the rural areas that caste is the strongest. Mass organisations will have to devote as much energy to the struggle against caste as they devote to the struggle against economic exploitation on new class lines.||Sharad Patil

First, contrary to the widespread view that the caste is a uniquely Indian phenomenon, the origin of varna is shown as basically a form of class differentiation. Secondly, caste, with many significant variations no doubt, is traced in the social developments in other parts of the world. Thirdly, the historical attempts made by Gandhi, Ambedkar and Lohia to solve the caste problem are briefly examined and their limitations revealed. Next, the spontaneous movements within the caste-class dichotomy in India are briefly studied. Finally, the class essence of the presently accentuated caste tensions is brought out.||Ajit Roy

This paper seeks to examine this argument with reference to Kerala, one of the two states which have so far refused to impose a total ban on slaughter of cows. The author discusses the extent of bovine slaughter in Kerala, the factors responsible for the increase in slaughter in recent years and the effects of slaughter on the size and composition of the state's bovine population. Cattle slaughter in Kerala, the author concludes, has resulted in a rise in milk and meat output and a ban on slaughter of cattle, especially cows, will adversely affect on-going livestock development projects and the weaker sections of the population.||K.

01/12/1979- ||special articles||4368187||Politics of Food and Famine in Bangladesh||Countries like Bangladesh are, even in normal times, vulnerable to pressures applied by donors of aid like the United States, and more so when they are faced with the prospect of natural or manmade famines, and when the aid sought is food. Such pressures have generally been related to specific issues of economic policy, though no doubt having political implications. In the situation of acute famine that prevailed in Bangladesh in 1974, however, the United States used food aid to exert political pressure - pressures which were to bear fruit in the political changes that were brought about in August 1975. This article reviews the nature and implications of the power of food as a political weapon. At the same time, it argues that while the famine in Bangladesh in 1974 might have had its immediate causes in the withholding of food by the US, such pressures could work because market forces remained controlled by big farmers and traders, and also because of certain obligations of the government towards segments of the population in the form of a commitment to statutory rationing in urban areas. The famine toll in 1974 could have been substantially reduced had only the government been able and willing to reallocate available food stocks and insist on shared austerity. This, manifestly, the government of Sheikh Mujib could not do. In conclusion, the anticle proposes the creation of a food reserve facility by Third World countries, in collaboration with OPEC, which could be used to stabilise the supply and price of foodgrains, and which could be availed of by these countries at times of crisis.||Rehman Sobhan

This article attempts to evaluate this programme. It begins with a general discussion of the bovine economy in India and the many conflicting issues involved in its development, particularly the differing needs that influence the raising of draught animals and milch animals, of indigenous cattle and cross-bred cattle, and of cows and bullocks as against buffaloes. It goes on to describe various cross-breeding programmes that are being implemented in different pockets in the country and presents three specific case studies of areas where the cross-breeding programme is supposed to have been successfully implemented. According to the author, the economic impact of the cross-breeding programme has to be judged by setting the gains made in milk production against the setbacks and losses incurred in draught power availability.||A.

This paper which focuses attention on the inter-relationships between the R and D plans and the National Plan shows that there has been a broad conformity between the orientation of efforts in the R and D sector and the orderings of different socio-economic objectives in the National Plan, though this broad conformity itself cannot be viewed as entirely a planned outcome.||A.

Substantial sums of money are allocated to the University Grants Commission and to the Indian Council of Social Science Research to nurture social science research in universities and autonomous research institutions. Many Central government ministries and state government departments also make research grants and employ their own social science research staff. This article reviews those aspects of social science research that are intended to be relevant to public policies and programmes. The article is in two parts. Part One, which is being published this week, describes the institutional setting within which policy-oriented social science research takes place and briefly reviews some of the current research conducted in these institutions. Part Two, to be published next week, will describe the ways in which research findings are (or are not) used by policy-makers and, more broadly, the relationship between research and the policy process.||Myron Weiner

The Muslim elite in India has been indulging in this practice for articulating its grievances, for communicating with the Muslim masses, for framing its political strategies and for maintaining a separate political status for the community. This article examines the political and sociological dimensions of Muslim communalism in India. While actual voting behaviour of the Muslim masses brings hope to those sections of the Muslim elite who, however faintly, are striving to secularise Muslim politics, the obstacles in the path of such secularisation are many. The article briefly touched upon these obstacles, as also on the failure of Muslim intellectuals to present a comprehensive analysis of the Muslim situation in India without recourse to myths and mystification.||Moin Shakir

What most distinguishes the performance of Kerala compared to that of other states in India is the improvement in the health status of the rural population in general and of children and infants in particular. Kerala's achievement in the health field becomes all the more significant and relevant to low income countries when viewed against the facts that the level of per capita income, per capita expenditure on health, and medical infrastructure measures in terms of bed-population ratio, doctor-population ratio, etc, are actually lower here than in some of the other states. The reason for the better health status of Kerala lies in the state having given equal importance to preventive and promotive measures like sanitation, hygiene, immunisation programmes, infant and ante-natal care, health education, etc, as to curative medicine. Moreover, the spread of education, especially among women in the rural parts of Kerala, was a crucial factor contributing to the high degree of awareness of health problems and fuller utilisation of available health care facilities. The conclusion to which this case study leads is that given proper policies and priorities, lack of resources need not be an impediment to improvement of health status even in low income countries.||P.

It examines the classical hypothesis that the norms and institutions of the traditional Indian society are incompatible with the social and economic pre-conditions of modern technology, and argues that Indian entrepreneurs and workers found it relatively easy to move from the rural-agricultural nexus of traditional India to modern industrial work due to a degree of flexibility inherent in the traditional society as well as the unique interaction between Indian and Western intellectuals during the British rule. An attempt is then made to analyse the psychological, social, economic and political forces influencing the Indian industrial man and the implications of these forces for maintenance and development of a social order Indians may want to achieve.||N.

This paper attempts to study the seasonal migration of tribal labour from the predominantly rural district of Panchmahals in Gujarat into the rural areas of the neighbouring Kaira district falling under the command area of Mahi-Kadana irrigation project. It examines the phenomenon both at the origin of the migration and at the destination of the migratory labour. The paper is in four sections. Section one provides the general background to the two districts and section two examines the data of the first study conducted at the origin of migration. Section three constructs a model utilising more recent data collected at the destination of migration, and the last section presents a summary of the findings.||T. K. Jayaraman

As against this, even today agricultural production requires the co-operation of several castes, and even traditionally competition between different castes did occur though it was not very common. The use of the caste idiom is widespread, though the idea of hierarchy is being increasingly rejected by those groups traditionally confined to the bottom. There are continuities and discontinuities, and social anthropologists have to reconcile themselves to work in fuzzy areas where not only are boundaries not clear but multiple and contrary forces are at work.||M.

25/8/1979- ||review of management, august 1979||4367875||Developmental Responsibility and Profitability of Banks||There has been some anxiety about the declining trend in the profitability of banks in recent times and fears, perhaps exaggerated, have been expressed that if these trends continue, the costs of banks may overtake their incomes. Since one of the reasons for this decline in the profitability of banks is the 'developmental responsibilities' undertaken by them, there has been some criticism of this apparent departure from strict commercial practices. This article argues that such assumption of developmental responsibilities is inescapable for banks in the present Indian situation; that even if such commitments should result in some losses, they should be considered as expenditure involved in the process of learning to discharge this new role - in a way, some kind of R and D expenditure.||L.

Money's traditional functions as medium of exchange and store of value remain important in these countries, but its function as a conduit of resources from savers to investors is more central to an understanding of its contribution to development. This view of money and monetary policy in the less developed countries has been strengthened in recent years by a growing body of theoretical and empirical work in this area. This paper attempts to survey many of the issues which have been dealt with both by academic economists and policy-makers, to throw light on some of the important issues still remaining to be explored and to show the extent to which some of the core ideas are supported by the empirical evidence gathered from several less developed countries.||Warren L.

It then goes to describe the various laws that govern the formation and recognition of the trade unions and notes that there is both heavy unionisation of individual railwaymen as well as a multiplicity of unions in the Indian Railways. The administrative and political reasons for such a state of affairs are briefly touched upon towards the end of the paper.||D. Narasimha Reddy

It was as an attempt to understand the role of the caste system vis-a-vis class struggle and class organisation that the Atyachar Virodhi Samiti was constituted. The Samiti sought, among other things, to highlight the nature and extent of repression of scheduled castes in Marathwada in Maharashtra and to draw lessons for future action which the scheduled caste masses, including poor peasants and agricultural labourers, may have to take when such attacks occur again. With this objective in view, some representatives of the Samiti visited the riot-affected areas of Nanded, Parbhani and Aurangabad. What follows is a report of the visit.||Atyachar Virodh Samiti

The author here offers three examples where the incorporation of the risk and uncertainty concept into analysis clarifies specific and important features of Indian industrial behaviour in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries: (1) Why did Indian entrepreneurs in the Bombay cotton textile industry behave differently from Lancashire entrepreneurs, using the partnership rarely and the corporation very frequently? (2) Why did Indian entrepreneurs administer their industrial corporations via the managing agency and not with a board of directors? (3) Why did Indian cotton millowners in Bomaby persist in using the jobber system to administer their labour force rather than establish their own personnel offices?||Morris David Morris

This paper begins with a critical evaluation of such claims of Indian technological capability, and notes on the part of even relatively well-developed sectors of Indian industry a strong and persistent desire for continued junior partnership with foreign collaborators. It examines the extent to which imported technology has actually been adapted and assimilated with a view towards self-generation. It argues that Indian exercises in transfer of technology actually serve to inhibit development and utilisation of technological potential both in India and in the recipient countries leading to self-perpetuating dependence.||P.

01/12/1979- ||special articles||4368186||Formulating Fiscal Policies to Expand Employment in Indian Industry||There has been growing awareness that Indian fiscal provisions are biased toward capital intensive industrial undertakings. Proposals to reform fiscal policy and to institute provisions favouring labour intensive techniques have been advanced periodically. While presenting the 1979-80 Budget, the Finance Minister had announced the formation of an Expert Committee to investigate these matters. This paper analyses the channels for influencing industrial employment and the role of existing fiscal provisions. Reform proposals in India and abroad are reviewed. Certain issues in reformulating fiscal incentives to expand employment are examined in the context of a developing economy. Fiscal policies which discriminate by subindustry or small scale units are rejected as leading to inefficiencies and requiring knowledge of relationships which cannot be estimated on the basis of available data. It is suggested that grants related to the firm's employment or wage bill and levies related to its capital usage would restore the proper relative social scarcity prices of inputs. Other measures could promote greater utilisation of the existing capital stock. These policies could induce a socially efficient shift toward labour intensive products without burdening general public revenues. Several high priority areas of administrative and empirical economic research are also indicated.||Jonathan R. Kesselman

The assessment of leftist state governments is usually based on ideological predispositions and not on a careful analysis of its acts of commission and omission. The present article is meant to give an idea of the first communist ministry in Kerala. Generally the conclusion is a positive one, since real progress was made in various fields. The overthrow of the Namboodiripad ministry, however, undid many of these positive steps, though not all. The high level political consciousness in Kerala and the constant political and trade union pressure on the ruling classes could not be undone.||Georges Kristoffel Lieten

If traditional farming and grazing practices are allowed to continue in the Kumaon tracts, not only will the hill populations destroy the hill environment on which their own livelihood depends and be forced to migrate to the plains, but the damage caused to plains agriculture by alternating floods and droughts, silting, and possible climatic changes will endanger the livelihood of the whole nation.||Madhava Ashish

In this paper, the author attempts to suggest a package of measures which should help strengthen the basic morale and its rallying power during periods of crisis. The underlying principle of the measures suggested by the author is to set up institutions and processes which would encourage a bold and dynamic approach. The right kind of leadership is no doubt important, but the right kind of institutions and processes are even more important, especially from the long-term standpoint.||S. R. Sen

The problems are further compounded because most of the 'Indian states' are not simply functional divisions but represent more or less distinct linguistic, cultural and, in some cases, even ethnic units, with a continuous civilisation dating farther back than their federated existence. This article argues that the strengthening of the Indian federal system can be achieved not through further centralisation of authority (as has been sought to be done all these years), but by a legitimisation and further rationalisation of the territorial divisions of the country based on linguistic and cultural homogeneity as the main unit of political power and economic development.||Aswini K.

This paper, which is essentially a case study of the Kingdom of Panna founded by Maharaja Chhatrasal (1649-1731) in an isolated tract of the Bundela region, examines these socio-political features of pre-British Bundelkhand and relates them to the concepts of kingship, territory and property prevalent in those times in that region.||Ravindra K.

This paper argues that the Soviet Union draws substantial economic gain from trade and aid relations with the LDCs. These relations are largely economically motivated, although politics often determines from which country an item desired in trade will be acquired by the Soviet Union. The authors point out the essential similarity between the structure of Soviet-LDC relations and that of Western-LDC relations. It is suggested that the actions of the Soviet Union since the late 1950s are consistent with Lenin's description of imperialism and inconsistent with the principles of socialist trade. The paper ends with an examination of the effect of Soviet trade and aid on class relationships in India. It is shown that economic relations with the Soviet Union have reproduced the pattern of India's dependency on foreign powers.||Santosh K. Mehrotra,Patrick Clawson

Private tubewell irrigation picked up with the beginning of the first Five-Year Plan, and since then the number of private tubewells has risen steadily, from 3,000 in 1951 to 22,000 in 1961, 540,000 in 1971 and about 1.75 million in 1978. Area irrigated by tubewells too (both public and private) has increased from about 0.25 million hectares in 1961-62 to about five and a half million hectares in 1973-74. Today, tubewells probably account for 30 per cent of the total irrigation facilities of the country, though the percentage varies widely from state to state. This article attempts to assess the trends in tubewell irrigation during the 1951-78 period of planning and analyse the chief factors behind these trends.||B. D. Dhawan

Past experience has shown that in the absence of such an understanding, any development programme would only generate growth, but not distributive justice. This article, which is a case study of a dairy development programme in a cluster of villages in Karnataka, shows how strategies of rural developments which do not take into account production and distribution relations only further increase the already existing inequalities in rural India.||G.

14/4/1979- ||special articles||4367504||National Languages Policy and the Case for Nepali||This article examines developments towards the formation of a policy with respect to the national languages of India. Through a tortuous route, it has been acknowledged at the policy level that Indian society is multilingual and that all the languages of India have a right to grow. In this context, the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution has come to assume importance as representing the recognised national languages of India. However, for various reasons, the profession of linguistic pluralism has not been taken to its logical conclusion; on the contrary, it has been undermined in the recent past. Secondly, the criteria for selection of certain languages in (and exclusion of other languages from) the Eighth Schedule remain very unclear. In this context, the case for constitutional recognition of the Nepali language that is being insistently presented by the Indian Nepalis deserves attention. This article examines this case for Nepali with a view to reaching a conclusion that has relevance for policy and legislative action.||Surendra Munshi,Tridib Kumar Chakrabarti

They involve questionable assumptions regarding the nature and implications of technical change in agriculture. At the same time, they are inconsistent with the experience of agriculture in India and even in Japan which constitutes the classic case of agricultural development through yield-increasing (and labour-absorbing) innovations. They may as well conflict with the Plan's own goals of income, redistribution and surplus mobilisation from agriculture. This paper, though based on aggregated data, attempts the limited task of emphasising the need for re-evaluation of the employment implications of agricultural development in the Plan and highlighting a few important but hitherto neglected areas of research. The policy implication of the analysis is that if it is not possible to step up the rate of growth of overall output, the employment target will call for non-conventional, employment-oriented programmes like rural works on a sizeable scale.||J.

This paper, whose emphasis is on the expansion of the beef cattle sector in Latin America and its impact on the availability of food to the large masses of the people in the region, argues that increased beef cattle and meat production in the underdeveloped countries represents a far greater danger to nutrition than even the Green Revolution, and poses an enormous additional threat to the very survival of the peasantry in these countries. The vast amounts being invested in meat production by international financing agencies - and the vaster sums that the underdeveloped countries are being induced to contribute by way of 'counterpart funds' - will only result in availability of cheaper and more plentiful meat to the rich in industrialised countries and, more importantly, in super-profits to transnational agribusiness conglomerates.||Ernest Feder

Over the past few years it has become a major force shaping the economic policies of various countries. The Bank has been establishing permanent missions in underdeveloped countries, often located right within planning ministries. In an increasing number of countries, the Bank puts together and chairs a consortium of the principal bilateral and multilateral lenders that co-ordinates donor contributions and policies. One trump card of the Bank is that it determines governments' international credit ratings. Loans go increasingly to the world's most repressive regimes, those willing to implement fiscal measures dictated by the Bank - measures that penalise workers and peasants. Four countries which have experienced military take-overs and martial law since the early 1970s - Argentina, Chile, the Philippines and Uruguay - will receive a seven-fold increase in World Bank lending by 1979. Loans to all other borrowers will increase only three times.||Joseph Collins,Frances Moore Lappe

The crucial issue for these countries in the 1980s is not primarily the rate of population growth, since fertility reductions can anyway not be achieved without an improvement in the demographic quality of the population. What is crucial is genuine land reform, creation of more employment, improvement in technology and productivity even in the most primitive low-yielding activities, and the ensuring of a minimum quality of life, especially reduction in the rates of infant mortality, maternal mortality and morbidity.||Asok Mitra

This account of the experience of US corporations in India suggests that the US corporations contributed technology and often also commanded finance. Indian firms' contribution was chiefly in terms of marketing. Given their relative strengths and weaknesses, there is little scope for influencing the terms of technology import: all the government can do is to decide, consciously or unconsciously, whether a deal would go through or not. If it wants to influence the terms, the government has to be able to influence the three basic factors: technology, markets and finance.||Ashok V. Desai

The movement which has developed in Kerala since the abolition of tenancy has three main components: successful struggle for higher wages for agricultural labourers; espousal of the demand for 'fair' prices for farm products; and struggle for land. This paper attempts to understand these recent trends in the left movement in the light of long-term changes that have taken place in agrarian relations.||N. Krishnaji

The shift from the caste-tribal approach to a class approach and its effects are examined in the context of certain events in Prakashe, a village in Shahada tahsil. The paper concludes that such problems as faced in Shahada are bound to arise in all tribal movements; and the lessons of Shahada are that class interests do not obey caste or tribal boundaries and movements based purely on caste or tribal questions cannot take up economic issues without modifying their tribal or caste character.||S.
