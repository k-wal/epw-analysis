As such, the knowledge revolution offers a unique chance to leapfrog entire stages of development. This paper argues that in order to make such a leap Tamil Nadu needs to initiate a knowledge-led development policy that builds on the state's successful IT industry. This paper proposes a roadmap to raise the global competitiveness of Tamil Nadu's IT industry, through strengthening both the demand and the supply.||Nirupam Bajpai,Navi Radjou

This government at the centre is however based on principles. It will encourage only private sector activities. Since the state governments do not belong to the private domain, they will not be given permission to promote television channels on their own. Such is the conclusion derivable from the response of the union government to the request of the government of West Bengal for permission to operate a satellite telecasting channel of its own.||A. M.

So in 1878 Lytton proposed a gold standard, upvaluing, and making the rupee a token - unconventional and in parts flawed. Experts and the India Office rejected it rudely. This episode is revealed here for the first time, and examined. The historian of economic analysis will detect a likeness of Lytton's proposal with the exchange standard soon to be cobbled by London, and defended by Keynes in 1913.||Arun Banerji

Howeverm the nature of state intervention within Kashmir over the past 50 years is a critical missing link within academic discourse. A holistic analysis requires careful disentanglement from the evidence and a conclusion that is not biased to any one piece of the puzzle. Of course, this could result in an alternative hypothesis; one that may be a hybrid position and not necessarily a new perspective. A political economy framework sheds new light on the political intrigues that thwarted the welfare maximising benefits of the state's economic policies. Over time, this fuelled dissent, which mobilised into militancy, catalysed by several factors.||Siddhartha Prakash

The non-fulfilment of popular expectations, the swelling number of unemployed registered with the employment exchanges, the shift of sentiment in the refugee belts, suspicion about the proliferation of corruption amongst Left leaders and cadres much in the manner it did amongst Congressmen in the earlier decades, the disillusionment with socialist ideology following the debacle in eastern Europe, and the glamour of life and living in western countries as broadcast by the satellite television channels have gradually led to a steady fall in Left Front support in the urban and semi-urban pockets in the state. Much of what is happening at this moment, the Calcutta Corporation election outcome included, is a reflection of these developments.||A. M.

Evidence from Rural India||This paper empirically addresses the issue of the appropriate policy towards alcohol production and consumption in India by examining the impact of alternative policy prescriptions such as tax increases, prohibition, and the setting of age-limits on purchase on the numbers of people who report consuming alcohol. The paper suggests that an effective alternative strategy for curtailing alcohol consumption is an increase in prices, presumably via tax increases, on alcohol. If some of the tax revenues from an alcohol tax are used to school and educate the public, the gains in terms of reduced alcohol consumption rates would be even greater.||Ajay Mahal
26/2/2000- ||special articles||4408961||Child Health and Immunisation: A Macro-Perspective||The purpose of this paper is to critically evaluate the immunisation programme in a broad macro-perspective on demographic trends and child health. We have collated data on 15 major states starting from the beginning of the 1980s to mid-1990s, though observation on all variables uniformly over the period could not be secured. Our analysis suggests that there has been a slackening of the initial thrust (1990-91) of the EPI, which is of some concern from the point of vaccine preventable diseases (VPDs). Since the population of net infants is in the increasing phase in almost all states, the task of providing full coverage appears to be daunting given the present performance level in the underperforming states. Although the notion of 'herd immunity' is controversial, we may not be totally on the wrong track in concluding that though at the aggregate level VPD occurrence will go down, the incidence of local 'epidemic' in some states cannot be ruled out. It is evident from our studies on immunisation, that the programme lacks on both aspects of incentive and management and this is not due to any shortage in the financial and physical resources devoted to it. This is also corroborated by the better performances of politically better managed states as compared to states which suffered from inept political management and instability.||R. K.

This article examines the pattern of labour-business-state relations embodied in Chile's new compromise. It contends that the evolution of those relations during the 1990s can in large measure be traced to the strategy of opposition that the centre-left adopted toward the military regime and, as a by-product of that strategy, its growing embrace of the regime's economic model and business.||Patrick S.

The crisis did initiate reforms in right earnest, but once the immediate problems were overcome, rather than achieving fiscal consolidation, the attempt in successive budgets has been to create the illusion of achieving fiscal correction rather than really achieving it. The government has been concealing deterioration in the fiscal balance by placing emphasis on the fiscal deficit rather than more meaningful summary measures, and frequently changing its definition and method of measurement. Analysis shows that on a comparable basis fiscal deficit reduction has been marginal. On the contrary, other fiscal indicators have shown significant deterioration. Thus the claims about fiscal adjustment are illusory. Fiscal consolidation in India perhaps requires another crisis.||M. Govinda Rao,H. K. Amar Nath

Besides contributing substantially to foreign exchange earnings, the government expects tourism to provide employment benefits which, through the multiplier effect, can generate myrind other industries, and enable percolation of economic benefits to less developed areas. Goa is one such site, to be constructed as one of the premier beach resorts of India. Yet, such intensive tourist development necessitates marginalisation of the needs of the local population. Not only do the host communities lose control over their land and sea, which get increasingly exploited for tourist consumption, their share in the profits derived from tourist trade is minimal. Moreover, tourism often brings increased levels of crime, prostitution and drug use into local communities and effects the manipulation of their cultural traditions. In short, construction of tourist sites such as Goa is predicated upon a development ideology that defines local people's space as dispensible to the needs of national and transnational capital.||Paul Routledge

An important finding of the study is that rice accounts for a small and declining fraction of the total household income, and that rice income is relatively less unequally distributed than income from non-farm sources. The inequality in the distribution of education and landholdings are more important factors contributing to income inequality than the diffusion of modern rice technologies.||Mahabub Hossain,Fe Gascon,Esther B.

Secondly, the biomedical approach to human suffering is clearly inadequate especially in developing countries. Findings of a study of the leptospirosis epidemic in Gujarat show that the quick supply of drugs, opening of special wards in the hospitals, increased allocation of equipment, doctors, health workers, during the 1997-99 epidemics failed to save lives. The improvement of services and equipment temporarily during epidemics at PHCs and community health centres did not help change the reputation of these institutions overnight.||Purendra Prasad

The purpose of the present paper is to argue that, at least in the context of a society like ours, this is too limited a perspective on the question of democracy. Much more is at stake for the working class movement in defending democracy than merely the freedom to organise. The struggle over the form of government, far from being distinct and secondary to the struggle to alter the class-nature of the state, is in fact intimately enmeshed with the latter, so that one cannot talk of the one without talking of the other.||Prabhat Patnaik

To achieve these objectives, the government will need to play a proactive role. Rather than restricting themselves to issues conventionally covered by competition law, the authors consider, as part of competition policy, all those policy instruments that impinge on the promotion of competition in markets. Consequently, policies relating to trade, investment and technology development also come under the purview of competition policy insofar as they impinge on the process of competition. The formulation and implementation of an effective competition policy in the current context is a difficult task as it needs to be consistent with other policies which are transforming India into a liberal open economy.||Rakesh Basant,Sebastian Morris

Using forest use statistics this article shows that there has been a dramatic shift in the post-Chipko years away from state and commercial appropriation of forest resources. In the absence of visible conflicts, the everyday interaction between the state and local inhabitants has assumed greater importance and this everyday interaction is characterised by a critical difference between 'survival' and 'commercial' activities, as well as a difference in the management of resources that are perceived as 'stable-in-nature' (such as a fishery) and those that are perceived as 'flexible-in-nature' (such as a forest which can be cut down to make agricultural plots). These two differences form the basis for the construction of a 'moral' economy of the state as well as the sound management of common resources.

Various action groups in the coastal region conducted agitations but the issue, over the period, instead getting resolved, has grown complicated. At present, the rampant urbanisation and commercialisation process in the coastal region threatens not only the very livelihood of the tribal communities but also their culture and identity.

A review of the stands taken by the higher courts on cases relating to infrastructure projects on the one hand, and to environmental protection on the other, and an assessment of their implications for changing scope of judicial power throws up interesting issues.||Videh Upadhyay

An apprehension is being openly expressed: should the situation be mishandled, the rupee might collapse in the course of the next few months, giving rise in its wake to a wide array of consequential problems for the nation, even though it would be a bonanza for the advanced industrial countries of the west.||A.

Results indicated that income distribution was less unequal in technologically 'developed villages' than in 'less developed villages'. Agriculture and/or rice income was more equally distributed than non-agriculture income. Thus, the diffusion of modern agricultural technology did not affect the distribution of agriculture income but rather reduced inequality of overall income distribution. Further, rural poverty was lower in technologically 'developed villages' than in 'less developed villages'.||Jawahar Thakur,Manik L. Bose,Mahabub Hossain,A. Janaiah

There are two arguments for resisting this change: That it discriminates against states that have successfully carried out family planning programmes, and that it disrupts the federal balance of the country. The first argument is spurious, elevating one aspect of state policy above basic democratic principles. The second argument fits somewhat uneasily with the conception of the Lok Sabha as a 'house of the people'.||Alistair McMillan

Using data from a field study in Garhwal, this article points out that the analysis on which this evidence is based does not take into account the economic environment at that time. Once the chronic shortage of labour in these economies is explicitly recognised, an alternative explanation for most 'institutions' of resource conservation, based on the need to conserve labour, can be provided. This challenges the prevailing view of the Garhwali inhabitant as traditionally 'conservationist', and has significant repercussions for policy.||Jishnu Das

Anthropology provided a method, the method of intensive fieldwork, but the important thing was to understand events and activities in the broader social perspective of structure and change. Srinivas was deeply interested in change, although he believed, quite rightly, that the sociologist would not be able to make much of change if he let go of the idea of social structure.||Andre Beteille

Child labour in India, when sized down to realistic proportions, remains a ignoble illustration of exploitation and exclusion but a less dramatic illustration than would appear from the exaggerated claims and studies by some western observers. In the tradition of Mamdani, it still often is assumed that children are an economic asset, and that the high fertility, leading to child labour income, is actually a conscious household strategy of rural families. In this, the second part of the article, this view is traced in the course of field work in two villages in Uttar Pradesh. It is argued that advocacy of schooling and of family planning is constrained by limited availability rather than by cultural (de)formations.

Against this background, this paper makes a comprehensive attempt at providing alternate estimates of core inflation for India following the principle of exclusion and limited influence estimators of trimmed mean as well as weighted median. The monthly estimates for the 16-year period from April 1983 to March 1999 reveal that 20 per cent trimmed mean WPI provides a better explanation of inflation dynamics.||Deepak Mohanty,Deba Prasad Rath,M.

This is cause for concern because through judicial activism the court has played the role of legitimising and channelling various movements for social change and social justice. The dissenting judgment of Justice Bharucha, however, encourages hope that the trend of going back to the narrow legalistic paradigm of the judicial process will not be shared by the entire court.||S.

It laid to rest the sanguine prospect generated by the previous census, which showed an improvement in the ratio: to 934 in 1981 from 930 in 1971. Indeed, there has been a secular decline in the sex ratio from the beginning of this century.

Concerned government functionaries, employees and their unions and populist parties and politicians have opposed demonopolisation. But notwithstanding the cacophony, determined and clear-headed ministers acting in the public interest have been demonopolising telecom. They see telecom as electronic and photonic infrastructure for transportation of dematerialised, electronified information (voice, text, image and data). It should be ubiquitous, broad-band, high-speed and inexpensive. Only a multi-policy of competing companies can ensure this. India must put in peace such a policy, ignoring vested interests, and institute an objective sector regulator with enough teeth.||T. H. Chowdary

By minimising transport cost it has reinforced the importance of economic principles like comparative advantage. One cannot, however, speak with the same assurance of the continued relevance of classical political theory: the new communications technology has fused and confused the realms of the local and the global and created virtual domains of globality with major implications for sovereignty and the nation state.||Brishti Guha

The initial optimism regarding the growth in exports during the early years of liberalisation gradually waned after some period of devaluation. Export growth, reported in Indian official trade statistics, came down to actual export growth, reflected in partner country's trade statistics. An explanation like this is derived for India's recent nose-diving export growth. The study is undertaken for the period 1951-94, using US imports statistics. It has been shown that the impact of devaluation in 1966 and 1991 was actually felt on officially reported exports to US and not much on US imports from India.||Sugata Marjit,Byasdeb Dasgupta,Sandip Mitra

There is also a growing consensus that (i) the improved growth since 1980-81 reduced poverty, and (ii) the reforms in the 1990s increased the growth rate further, without dampening the process of poverty reduction. This study seeks to verify these propositions. Further, it examines some dimensions of income distribution - a neglected issue in the recent times - to assess if the developments during the last two decades led to a diffusion of growth - or a polarisation in the economy.||R.

The results show that in order to reduce rural poverty, the Indian government should give highest priority to additional investments in rural roads, agricultural research and education. These types of investment not only have much larger poverty impacts per rupee spent than any other government investment, but also generate higher productivity growth. Other investments (including irrigation, soil and water conservation, health, and rural and community development) have only modest impacts on growth and poverty per additional rupee spent.||Shenggen Fan,Peter Hazell,S.

Child labour in India, when sized down to realistic proportions, remains an ignoble illustration of exploitation and exclusion but a less dramatic illustration than would appear from the exaggerated claims and studies by some western observers. In the tradition of Mamdani, it still often is assumed that children are an economic asset, and that the high fertility, leading to child labour income, is actually a conscious household strategy of rural families.

The period under consideration is from 1970, prior to the adoption of World Health Organisation's Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) by the government of India, to the first National Pulse Polio Immunisation Campaign held during 1995-96. The change in state policy from management and control of the disease to its eradication is an outcome of the interaction between local and global factors in international health. The interface between the Indian state and the medical profession foregrounds the discussion in the present paper. Indian researchers have questioned the OPV immunisation regime promoted by the global EPI. A survey of Indian paediatric literature reveals that concerns with vaccination efficacy and the immunisation schedule are accorded prime importance in the medical research on poliomyelitis. The review of the medical literature shows how studies on country-specific pathogenesis of vaccine preventable diseases result in recommendations for alternative vaccine regimes that contest the universal norms put forward by the global EPI.||Renu Addlakha

This paper assesses the impacts of recent government initiatives on income distribution and poverty under two varying ecosystems, irrigated and rainfed, based on an intensive household survey in four villages during 1996. Major findings indicate that the recent government's policy on the promotion of modern rice technology and irrigation did not increase household income due to farmers' inability to cope with the economic and technical demands of the new rice-based technologies. The study also identifies household size, education and higher proportion of female members in the household as major factors that affected poverty. Finally, the paper suggests strategies and policy reforms to help reduce income inequality and poverty in rural Myanmar.||Yolanda T. Garcia,Arnulfo G. Garcia,Marlar Oo,Mahabub Hossain

This prompts the location of debates on diversity, plurality and the university in a longer 'duree' ranging across the colonial and post-colonial era and framing a wide range of issues. This paper first deals with the concept of the university and its relationship to the liberal imagination and then explores the nationalist debate on how the modern university was conceived. A third section deals with the issue of language and educational policy focusing on the battles triggered by the Mandal Report. The concluding section examines the immediate question of nuclearisation of India and Pakistan and the possible role of the university in this context, outlining a critical role for it.||Shiv Visvanathan

The ecology-centred model emerged in answer, and emphasised the creation of more national parks and sanctuaries. Ironically, this also led to the displacement of a large number of native people and their further marginalisation and sufferings in social, economic and cultural terms. This paper discusses the case of displacement and resettlement of the 'maldharis' of the Gir forest in Gujarat, who were displaced and resettled in 1970s and 1980s as a result of creation of a sanctuary and later a national park in the Gir forest. The state government policy of resettlement had a negative view of the maldharis, and was neither well-conceived nor implemented systematically. At present, there is an eco-development project in the Gir protected area sponsored by the World Bank, which does not approve of forced relocation and provides for voluntary relocation in a participatory way. Accordingly, the state government stance has changed, but on an experimental basis and only for this one project.||Kameshwar Choudhary

By adopting the log-linear country credit rating model, this paper estimates the cost of capital for 136 countries, with or without equity markets. India's low stock return correlation with the return on the global index indicates that if the residents are permitted to hold a globally diversified portfolio, they could significantly reduce their exposure to unsystematic risks. Without this the cost of equity capital (which should compensate only for systematic risk) may be higher.||Yan Qin,Sitikantha Pattanaik

In the first phase nationalist economic doctrines led to a state-dominated pluralism in the IR arena that finally gave way to its crisis of legitimacy. The state slowly began to withdraw from the economic domain. The second phase represents the post-liberalisation period with the 'structural adjustment programme'. The essential thesis of this paper is that the gradual spread of market principles has led to wide inter-regional and inter-sectoral differences in the levels of economic activity resulting in turn in considerable variation in the nature of labour-management relations.

But in the post-Mandal period, the 'secularity' of caste and the dalit movement have proved effective in combating the rising Hindutva forces, even making 'caste' respectable. However, even as the radical and secular potential of caste is stressed, there is little attempt to theorise the question of caste. This paper explores the theoretical implications of a radical, secular politics and to unravel the existentialist dilemmas of dalit politics.||Aditya Nigam

The present paper maintains that the distribution of literates across households also matters, due to the external effects of literacy - the benefits that illiterate members of a household derive from having a literate person in the family. The authors review this argument, draw out its policy implications, and present some suggestive data from Bangladesh to lend substance to the hypothesis that an illiterate belonging to a household with no literates is more deprived than an illiterate belonging to a household with at least one literate member.||Kaushik Basu,James E.

This 'Gujarat model' rests on key assumptions about being able to shape and construct markets through policy intervention. In this paper, empirical comparative data on water markets in two villages shows instead that exchange processes are shaped by: hydro-geological factors which influence the risk of accessing water and the fixed costs of drilling wells; path dependence in the construction of irrigation infrastructure (wells and pipelines); and historical precedent and social norms which determine the institutional rules under which water is sold. But actual patterns of exchange rate shaped by complex local institutions. To understand how terms of exchange are structured and shaped over time requires attention to the micro-analytics of how real markets for groundwater actually function. Accordingly, the paper analyses local informal norms of exchange, and explores how they change over time.||Navroz K. Dubash

Socially responsible resettlement - that is, resettlement genuinely guided by an equity compass - can counteract lasting impoverishment and generate benefits for both the national and local economy. Yet, much too often, those who approve and design projects causing displacement are deprived of an 'equity compass' that can guide them in allocating project resources and preventing (or mitigating) the risks of impoverishment. In an attempt to help develop such an equity compass, this paper proposes a risks-and-reconstruction-oriented framework for resettlement operations. It argues against some chronic flaws in the policies and methodologies for planning and financing resettlement and recommends necessary improvements in policy and in mainstream resettlement practices.||Michael M.

Results show that the adoption of modern rice varieties under irrigated conditions substantially increased rice yield and reduced the unit cost of production, but the profit and income effect was insignificant when they are cultivated under rainfed conditions. The concentration of income and the incidence of poverty were lower in the 'developed' villages than in the 'less developed' villages.||Tran Thi Ut,Mahabub Hossain,A. Janaiah

This would call for privatisation of distribution, and change in the institutional mechanism for the administration of the subsidy. Rather than the detailed regulatory mechanisms which are being pushed by the central government and the regulators, light and price-cap type regulation would suit India better. A model plan for change is put forward for the Gujarat State Electricity Board, which is quite general and could easily apply to other SEBs. A complete separation of distribution from generation is neither necessary nor desirable. Existing IPP contracts would have to be extinguished and methods to carry out the same are suggested. The danger of mounting regulatory risk, either shutting out private power production, or resulting in massive tariff increases taking place are real.||Sebastian Morris

Moreover, Indian firms depend far more heavily on external debt as a source of finance than do firms in advanced countries. This paper argues that an adequate explanation for this would need to weave in two central issues - the institutional structure of the banking sector with government guarantees of stability and viability and the oligopolistic nature of maturing firms that are attempting to dominate the market. An explanation for the structure of corporate finance must, apart from institutional issues, attempt to fathom why the firm as an issuer of securities would resort more to debt than equity. The structure of corporate finance in India is thus the result of a banking system that is protected against failure, oliogopolistic market structures with uncertainty regarding the demand for products. The financing strategy adopted by firms in such an environment, the author demonstrates, is part of an attempt to achieve market dominance.||Errol D'Souza

Militancy in Assam is not a mere law and order problem but a reflection of a deeper malaise afecting the whole society. Neither can it be dubbed as radical politics of the marginalised communities against hegemonising forces. Politics of identity in Assam is basically trapped in the world of appearances, fighting imaginary enemies, and drawing strength from prejudices and misconceptions of groups about themselves and others. Without an understanding of the material and ideological roots that gives birth to militancy, restoring peace in Assam would be an uphill task.||H. Srikanth

The state government appointed an expert committee to look into the problem and suggest remedial measures for dealing with sickness of these factories. One of the recommendations of the committee was the reintroduction of zoning. The writer, a member of the committee, argues in his 'Note of Dissent' on this recommendation that it is not the absence of zoning but the presence of deeply rooted financial and political involvement of the state government and the resultant inefficiency in these factories that is the root cause of the abject condition of these factories.||D.

It reports findings on changes in distribution of landholdings, education and occupation of rural workers, structure and distribution of incomes, and income and non-income dimensions of poverty. The article concludes with the view that policies based on providing better access to capital and education for the poor would make a greater impact on poverty reduction than policies based on interventions in the operation of land and labour markets.||Mahabub Hossain,Binayak Sen,Hossain Zillur Rahman

Front-line health workers, ANMs are the focus of the analysis here, as they constantly negotiate between the health bureaucracy and the communities (local bureaucracies). This article demonstrates how programmatic goals are mediated by local contexts through these health workers, and how their perceptions and practices produce numerical narratives which meet the demands of rule and record bound bureaucratic imagination.||Lester Coutinho,Suman Bisht,Gauri Raje

These are not possible unless the size of the government is reduced and transparency and accountability in decision-making and administration introduced.

Using NSS data on consumption for the 13th to the 53rd Rounds, I compute the Gini coefficient, real mean consumption and the head count ratio for rural and urban sectors and average for 14 major Indian states. The rank concordance index across states does not usually show convergence. Nevertheless, there is (conditional) convergence (in terms of levels) in inequality and poverty measures across states. The coefficients of variation do not show any tendency to fall over time. What is particularly worrisome is that the coefficient of variation of the rural head count ratio seems to be rising over time, indicating greater dispersion in rural poverty across states.||Raghbendra Jha

An Empirical Analysis of Rural India||Developing countries allocate scarce government funds to investments in rural areas to achieve the twin goals of agricultural growth and poverty alleviation. Choices have to be made between different types of investments, especially infrastructure, human capital and agricultural research, and between different types of agricultural regions, e g, irrigated and high- and low-potential rainfed areas. This paper develops an econometric approach and provides empirical evidence on the impact of government investments in rural India. While irrigated areas played a key role in agricultural growth during the green revolution era, our results show that it is now the rainfed areas, including many less-favoured areas, that give the most growth for an additional unit of investment. Moreover, investments in rainfed areas have a much larger impact on poverty alleviation, making them a win-win strategy. These results have important policy implications, and challenge conventional thinking that public investments in rural areas should always be targeted to irrigated and other high potential areas.||Shenggen Fan,Peter Hazell

Free trade with technologically advanced economies, especially with the US, from the initial stages of its birth provided scope for realisation of technological and informational externalities.

Assessing the strength and limitations of India's S and T capacities, the paper finds that the fundamental weaknesses of the Indian technology base are organisational and cultural, including inertia in policy making and strong preferences for tradition and continuity. The education policy has failed to give required impetus to engineering and technology, and consequently, Indian research capacity is primarily directed towards basic science research that has less relevance to advanced industrial applications. Though these shortcomings are a staple of government reports, scientific conferences and newspaper commentary, the government has not taken any initiatives to redress them. If anything, the paper argues, liberalisation will make the problem worse as the leadership is either unaware of the extent of the problem or overly sanguine about the prospects of its solution.||Ravinder Pal Singh

Season has the biggest effect on agricultural work, which dramatically increases during the monsoon season, and fuel collection, which increases during the winter season.

By putting a zero value on trees as timber, it encourages a shift to lower value uses and thus the mining of forest resources. Rather than restricting the notion of property rights of forest dwellers, as the Supreme Court ruling does, the international trend is towards increasing acceptance of property rights and the related commoditisation of the environmental services that forests (i e, the forest dwellers) provide to the external world. Finally, the Supreme Court order specifies that all sawmills should be located only in designated industrial estates. In practice what this would lead to is discrimination against the emerging local capitalist enterprises in favour of those operated by the bigger pan-Indian capitalists.||Dev Nathan

First, it is argued here, the current elite-focused approaches and recipes are insufficient. Politics is getting more localised and there is a special need to study actors and processes that may deepen democracy. Secondly, the problems of attempts at popular politics of democratisation are examined. Third, this view from below is used to analyse the 1999 elections and their turbulent aftermath.||Olle Tornquist

What Kutch needs is rainwater harvesting, livestock development and better techniques of dryland agriculture.||Lyla Mehta

Empirical results show wide disparities in levels of living in terms of economic and social indicators in rural and urban India. The comparison of the distribution with a similar survey conducted in 1975-76 shows the changes in the pattern of income distribution and the gap between the shares of income in rural and urban areas during the last two decades.||Basanta K.

These include the three southern states, minus Kerala, but also Maharashtra. FI is not merely not dying away, it is emerging as a disturbing new phenomenon. That eradication of this practice is not on the agenda of the central or concerned state governments or even of the major political parties reflects the gender insensitivity in our society and polity. However, in Tamil Nadu over the last four-five years, a serious governmental effort is on to address the issue. Evidence from a set of interventions in Dharmapuri district suggests that, with political will, widespread generation of awareness and social mobilisation, a dent can be made in eradicating the evil of FI.||Venkatesh Athreya,Sheela Rani Chunkath

This evidence also suggests that more than three-quarters of this spending includes private 'out-of-pocket expenses'. Despite such a high share of expenditure by individuals, the provision of health care, that is adequate in terms of quality and access, is becoming more and more problematic. Particularly, public delivery of health care is poor in quality, presumably for reasons of inadequate financing. This highlights the need for alternative finances, including provision for medical insurance at a much wider level. The paper attempts to review a variety of health insurance systems in India (defined here as any mechanism which covers the risks of payment for health care at the time of its requirement), their limitations and the role of the General Insurance Corporation as an important insurer agency. It also attempts to develop a prospectus of strategy for greater regulation and increased health insurance coverage by making suitable changes - particularly in claim settlements and the exclusion clause. Also highlighted is the need for a competitive environment (which is at present completely missing), and an opening up of the insurance sector.||Randall P. Ellis,Moneer Alam,Indrani Gupta

In this paper an attempt is made to study the capabilities in R and D in the Indian pharmaceutical industry in terms of magnitude and direction. An analysis based on 33 companies shows that some diversified companies are equally equipped to commercialise biotechnology as most of the dedicated biotech companies but this requires an organised effort by all interested parties, namely, research organisations, the state and the industry.||S.

However, an increasing devolution of self-assertion in recent years has provided such hitherto marginalised groups a new opportunity to claim their rights and reaffirm their identities in a new context. But self-rule needs a history and a reconstruction of Warli history can only begin with a relook at their oral traditions.||Rudolf C. Heredia,Ajay Dandekar

As development makes land more attractive, tribals will need protection - and urgently.||E. Karuppaiyan

Among the range of users, the mother of the child in a distinctive local world emerges as the target user. The East Delhi Introductory Trial constitutes the ethnographic site for an understanding of user constructions among various public health officials. Corresponding to these user representations are the lived experiences of actual users negotiating with health problems in their everyday lives in specific local settings. The concluding section of the paper will compare and contrast providers' representations of the user with the users' self-representations as appropriators of child health services in both the community and biomedical spaces.||Renu Addlakha,Aruna Grover

Systematic studies of tribal demographic behaviour can, however, provide important insights into how different patterns of demographic behaviour can be attributed to socio-cultural differences. Evaluating fertility differences between tribal and non-tribal groups in the past may prove useful for a better understanding of contemporary differences in fertility and their determinants. This paper analyses tribal fertility in comparative perspective, in the late 19th and early 20th century.||Arup Maharatna

Second, I have attempted to understand some macroeconomic implications of the budget making some reasonably realistic assumptions about how the policy scenario might unfold. I have also tried to indicate the policy challenges that will emerge in this scenario and the shortcomings of what I expect the policy response to be as well as what I perceive to be the desired course of action.||Raghbendra Jha

Furthermore, special care has been taken in selecting the medium best suited for relaying the messages. The study also shows how in the process a particular form gets invested with values usually foreign to it. The study also shows how the government, in a subtle shift from its easier image, has been focusing on the creation of a new visuality of progress which is a fission of tradition and modernity.||Mani Shekhar Singh,Aditya Bharadwaj

Today more than three months after the abduction and with no clear end to the crisis, it is critical to take stock of this bizarre event, and its meanings within contemporary Indian political discourse. In the essays that follow, written before Rajkumar's release from captivity, three scholars from Karnataka, Madhava Prasad, Janaki Nair and Tejaswini Niranjana, offer their reflections on the event, on the history of Kannada nationalism and on the cultural productions that construct new meanings of the event, in an attempt to chart the emerging field of forces and its consequences for the shape of not just regional but national political life. In spite of its bizarre and irrational appearance, Rajkumar's abduction is a flash of lightning that reveals, momentarily, the makeshift hinges of the Indian political structure.||M. Madhava Prasad

Tracking (Trans)national Realities in Bangladeshi Factories||Bangladesh's successful entry into the world apparel market has been predicated on the deployment of a predominantly female industrial labour force. Bangladesh can be seen as a quintessentially global site - where the language of public discourse is dominated by a developmentalist vocabulary of civil society - human rights, women's development, citizenship. This essay points out that reducing the lives of Bangladeshi garment workers to a local variation on either the universally subordinated woman or the global worker exploited by capital obscures the implications of work for these women. Shifting the frame of analysis to a more experiential level allows us to overcome the more exclusionary aspects of an ostensibly culture neutral human rights discourse and offers a more complex lens with which to examine the conditions and contours of resistance.||Dina M.

Through improvisations in traditional theatre, where times are at once fluid and interchangeable, and the ecology embedded in ritual cultural practices that ensures their continuity, the essay examines the anti-historical prejudice in colonialist readings of 'Indian time' in juxtaposition with fundamentalist readings of the 'Indian past'. Focusing on the social implications of the 'death of utopia' in the contexts of Kaliyuga and globalisation, the essay offers alternatives to the marketing of memory in Gandhi's affirmation of 'imaginary' villages, Krishnamurti's advocacy of the 'ending of time', and Lohia's envisioning of 'immediacy' in an 'interval during politics'. The essay suggests that a recognition of the mutations of time can begin only through a new alertness to its multiple enigmas.||Rustom Bharucha

Subsequently India refused to become a party to either of them because of the gross changes in the original drafts at the instance of the US, which qualitatively overturned the intent and purpose of these proposals. Similarly, the CTBT - a treaty to end all tests - which was to serve as an initial step in nuclear disarmament, first ended up as a partial test ban treaty (PTBT) which left the door open for unbridled underground tests and remained de-linked from the issue of nuclear disarmament. Some 30 years later, the CTBT was resurrected, but just as before, it has ended up being yet another version of the PTBT and totally divorced from the issue of nuclear disarmament. The present CTBT has several peculiar features which give evidence of US double standards on disarmament issues. Should humanity continue to be a party to this game of deceit or should it put an end to this game once and for all and bring the issue of prevention of nuclear war and nuclear disarmament to the centrestage?||N.

The share of rice in total household income was higher in the irrigated areas than in the rainfed, but the concentration of income from this source was almost the same. Technology-irrigation intensity contributed to higher incomes, but a larger share of the income accrued to land and capital. Rice contributed to an increase in household income inequality but it was offset by a reduction in income inequality from the non-farm sources. The incidence, depth, and severity of rural poverty were much lower in the irrigated ecosystem than in the rainfed.||A. Janaiah,Manik L. Bose,A. G. Agarwal

In this context two sets of questions arise. The first set centres on whether some forms of capit al flows are preferable to others. This issue has to be addressed from the angles of volatility and impact on capital formation and growth. The second set of questions relates to the extent and forms of controls that can be imposed on capital flows. Opening up of capital account need not preclude the imposition of moderate controls, either price based or regulatory, on capital flows. Controls should be selective, designed to achieve the specific objective of containing speculative flows. The Asian crisis is not an argument against capital account liberalisation. Capital account liberalisation is not a discrete event. It is a process and should be done in stages.||C. Rangarajan

29/1/2000-04/2/2000||special articles||4408885||On Predicting Exchange Rates||This paper explores two main issues. First, it attempts to assess the two-way interactions between business cycles and exchange rates: initially by examining some of the main factors that influence exchange rates, and then by considering the role of exchange rates in stabilising business cycles. In doing so, it also looks at some of the relevant theories that seek to explain these stylised facts of interrelated economic fluctuations. Second, the paper provides an analytical framework which, by formalising the nature of the relationships between key macro-economic variables, helps to forecast the exchange rate inter alia in the Indian context. This is accomplished by invoking a unique model closure condition which is based on the extent of (mis)alignment of the actual exchange rate with the 'shadow floating exchange rate'. For the financial year 1999-2000, the results indicate a reserve accretion of $ 2.62 billion, an inflation rate of 5.04 per cent (as measured by the GDP deflator) and a growth rate of 6.03 per cent. They also suggest that the interest rate (on one-year term deposits) should be reduced to about 8.34 per cent from its current level of around 9 per cent; and, most important of all, predict that the nominal exchange rate could depreciate to about Rs 44.59/$ by end March 2000. The plausibility of all these forecasts implies that there is considerable basis for using the model not only for prediction but also for designing growth-oriented stabilisation programmes as well as policy co-ordination strategies.||M.

As a key phrase, personal responsibility operates within a particular cultural logic designed to influence the public imagination about the social lives of young women who mother. Personal responsibility effectively redirects welfare debates away from the structural and political causes of poverty by emphasising the behaviours and decisions of individual women. Poverty becomes explained in terms of behavioural causes that delegitimate political and economic concerns. The portrait that emerges from the ethnographic data on young Puerto Rican mothers from a fieldwork study in New York city for all these young women personal responsibility appeared as an integral aspect of their struggle to support themselves and their children while living in families that were already economically precarious. It calls into question the image of teenage mothers as "feeding off the system" or as non-productive individuals. Such authoritative, state-sponsored cultural narratives about the lives of young mothers make it possible to deflect attention from the actual causes of the declining well-being of the nation. As a racial project, the principle of personal responsibility acts as a non-racial code word that signals to the "American people" who to blame for the decline of its economic (and political) hegemony.||Caridad Souza

Similarly, it would require massive doses of investment in irrigation and R and D before a significant weather-proofing of Indian agriculture can be achieved and to expect that the proposals contained in the budget for 2000-2001 can put agriculture on a sustainable growth path of 4 per cent per annum is naive.||Ashok Gulati

Among our findings are: CPRs made up about 12 per cent of poor households' income; fuel and fodder were the most important CPRs accessed by the poor; and women and girls are mainly responsible for collection of CPRs, which may be why their importance to the poor is largely ignored. Poor people are being systematically excluded from customary access to CPRs, a key element in their livelihoods, at an alarming rate. The main causes of this exclusion are agricultural intensification, commoditisation of CPRs, environmental degradation and population growth. New forms of 'community' management of environmental resources, which have been promoted by governments and aid donors over the last 10 years, may add to the exclusion of the poor.||Tony Beck,Madan G.

This requires not so much additional resources - which would only result in further leakages and swelling of the already bloated bureaucracy - as better policies and sound delivery mechanisms.

The aim should be the satisfaction of the ultimate borrower at minimum cost. Cost reduction per unit of business can be achieved by integration of short- and long-term wings, rationalisation of co-operative structure by removing one of the tiers, exploiting scope and scale economies available in rural lending. The limitations of the co-operative system such as inability to offer all types of financial services that commercial banks/RRBs do such as money transfer, restricted area of operation and activities, inability to cater to credit needs for all purposes from a single outlet, low level of professionalisation, etc, have to be overcome. Real success comes when co-operatives take full advantage of their ability to have close interface with the clientele. This ability almost matches similar ability of non-institutional rural lenders and can never, possibly, be acquired by other institutional agencies.||K. J. S. Satyasai,K. C. Badatya

After controlling for tax capacity we find a negative impact on own tax revenue of lump sum 'untied' grants that are predictable and unvarying. The reduction in own tax revenue is the result of a selective slackening of tax effort. The post-grant pattern of tax incidence will therefore be less transparent than the nominal pattern, less preserving of voter preferences, and possibly driven by corruption towards greater regressivity. The data contradicts the flypaper effect and also theories of fiscal effects of ethnic fragmentation.||Indira Rajaraman,Garima Vasishtha

It is obvious that such intervention affects the exchange rate in two ways, first, by affecting the extent of excess demand in the foreign exchange market, and thereafter through a complex interplay of the macro-economic variables. The stylised literature has addressed this issue by estimating the so-called offset coefficients, a method that is ad hoc and that is marked by the conspicuous absence of an underlying macro-model. In this paper, we build on the stylised Mundell-Fleming model, and derive an estimable reduced form expression that allows us to link exchange rate movements with the RBI's interventions. The model itself, and the subsequent empirical result indicate that the effect of RBI's intervention in the foreign exchange market is at best unclear. Specifically, given the time span of the data, the RBI's interventions in the market seem to have been ineffective.||Sumon Kumar Bhaumik,Hiranya Mukhopadhyay

The paper formalises these links within two analytical frameworks, static as well as dynamic, which by highlighting the concepts of the 'high interest trap' and the 'tight money paradox', respectively, suggests that, for any given deficit, there exists optimal levels of monetisation and market borrowings. The model is then applied to evaluate the implications of the union budget 2000-01 and the results indicate that unless government borrowings are reduced substantially, and about 40 per cent of the deficit is monetised, the inflation rate as well as the interest rate could be much higher than what they fundamentally ought to be.||M.

This approach has the weakness that it requires substantial reliance on supervision. Second, the best practices were introduced without bank behavioural responses to them being well understood. Third, diversification as a means of making the banking system safer has not been explored. It is argued that the introduction of prudential regulation turned a credit liberal regime spawned by implicit government guarantees of bank safety and stability into a credit constrained regime. This regime is characterised by a reduction in lending and change in the composition of lending towards assets with a lower risk weighting such as government securities which is a temporary stock adjustment response by banks as they seek more sustainable balance sheet positions. Shifting from an emphasis on supervision towards more reliance on incentives to ensure safe and sound banking it is argued can be achieved by introducing contingent liability, structured supervision, and diversification.||Errol D'Souza

This paper brings out the inadequacies of the bill and suggests improvements to it as also parallel actions which will help make the proposed act meaningful.||Madhav Godbole

It is also more open in its foreign relations, though the US has hardened its stand.||Ninan Koshy

This paper argues in favour of a season-sensitive information base to empower the rural population with capabilities to make decisions about their lives and their environment. Generation and use of information within the framework of seasonality of rural livelihoods (specific to the temporal and spatial context) is presented as a crucial input for sustainable development. Integrated participatory seasonal observations are the optimum amount of information that enables the rural population to analyse and explain, make decisions about and consciously change their livelihoods. Systems concepts inform all the critical stages of institutionalisation of an integrated participatory seasonal observation system (IPSOS), and participatory formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of counter-seasonal development projects. The IPSOS facility also has scope for participatory monitoring and evaluation of development.||Rajeswari S. Raina

But the expenditure is already too high for a poor country, is used wastefully and, worse, 'national security' is misconceived.||Gautam Navlakha
23/9/2000-29/9/2000||special articles||4409777||Globalisation and Inequality: An Analytical Perspective||With the possible exception of the east Asian countries, increased foreign trade and investment have increased wage inequality in almost all parts of the globe during the last two decades of the 20th century. Theoretically as well as empirically Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson model of trade, with the Stolper-Samuelson result at its core, fails to explain such widening of wage gap between skilled and unskilled labour particularly in the south. This paper discusses alternative variants of the specific factor model accounting for the diverse trade pattern, informal factor markets and existence of non-traded goods, that can help our understanding of the wage gap phenomenon.||Rajat Acharyya,Sugata Marjit

But before all this, we need to improve significantly our governance in Kashmir. An unhappy populace remains the biggest obstacle to peace.||Harsh Sethi

This article examines caesarean sections as a case study in the context of current developments in the health sector, the uneven availability of medicare, people's perceptions of medical interventions, the largely unregulated private sector in medicare and the disturbing trend of unethical medical practices.||Madhukar Pai

This article analyses available evidence to find that industrial concerns have been consolidating their activities to retain competitiveness but research and development has suffered. Quality upgradation is a priority but product differentiation is favoured over improvement in marketing and distribution. Export orientation is limited.||Rakesh Basant

True, the fiscal programme does not provide any answer to the sluggishness in industrial output and investment. Further, the second half of the year may see some pressure on expenditure, particularly non-plan expenditure. Even so, the all-round improvement in government finances augurs well for the financial markets.||EPW Research Foundation

Its proponents assert that its application has improved the way in which the governments of many industrialised countries do business. As for the third world, this paper argues through a case study of emerging trends in the health care sector in Tamil Nadu, that there are many constraints on government capacity to play the complex new roles associated with NPM.||Sara Bennett,V.
