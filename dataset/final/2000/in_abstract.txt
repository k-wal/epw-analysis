But there is much that can and must be saved. Civil society's strong and determined intervention to save the Chilka Lake has shown the way. Environmentalists and social activists must join hands to mobilise public opinion to save the Sundarbans and its 3.5 million small farmers, fishermen, woodcutters, honey collectors, boatmen and the like.||D.

Only in recent years have waste land management programmes accorded higher priority to participatory approaches. This paper discusses the factors affecting participation and suggests possibilities for the horizontal and vertical upscaling of participation in the management of natural resources.||N. S. Jodha

Using forest use statistics this article shows that there has been a dramatic shift in the post-Chipko years away from state and commercial appropriation of forest resources. In the absence of visible conflicts, the everyday interaction between the state and local inhabitants has assumed greater importance and this everyday interaction is characterised by a critical difference between 'survival' and 'commercial' activities, as well as a difference in the management of resources that are perceived as 'stable-in-nature' (such as a fishery) and those that are perceived as 'flexible-in-nature' (such as a forest which can be cut down to make agricultural plots). These two differences form the basis for the construction of a 'moral' economy of the state as well as the sound management of common resources.

A review of the stands taken by the higher courts on cases relating to infrastructure projects on the one hand, and to environmental protection on the other, and an assessment of their implications for changing scope of judicial power throws up interesting issues.||Videh Upadhyay

Results indicated that income distribution was less unequal in technologically 'developed villages' than in 'less developed villages'. Agriculture and/or rice income was more equally distributed than non-agriculture income. Thus, the diffusion of modern agricultural technology did not affect the distribution of agriculture income but rather reduced inequality of overall income distribution. Further, rural poverty was lower in technologically 'developed villages' than in 'less developed villages'.||Jawahar Thakur,Manik L. Bose,Mahabub Hossain,A. Janaiah

Even more important is the issue of how the local people can be made to participate effectively in programmes of development. This is not going to be easy and outsiders, even committed NGOs can only be catalysts.||Ashish Bose

The ecology-centred model emerged in answer, and emphasised the creation of more national parks and sanctuaries. Ironically, this also led to the displacement of a large number of native people and their further marginalisation and sufferings in social, economic and cultural terms. This paper discusses the case of displacement and resettlement of the 'maldharis' of the Gir forest in Gujarat, who were displaced and resettled in 1970s and 1980s as a result of creation of a sanctuary and later a national park in the Gir forest. The state government policy of resettlement had a negative view of the maldharis, and was neither well-conceived nor implemented systematically. At present, there is an eco-development project in the Gir protected area sponsored by the World Bank, which does not approve of forced relocation and provides for voluntary relocation in a participatory way. Accordingly, the state government stance has changed, but on an experimental basis and only for this one project.||Kameshwar Choudhary

Moreover, Indian firms depend far more heavily on external debt as a source of finance than do firms in advanced countries. This paper argues that an adequate explanation for this would need to weave in two central issues - the institutional structure of the banking sector with government guarantees of stability and viability and the oligopolistic nature of maturing firms that are attempting to dominate the market. An explanation for the structure of corporate finance must, apart from institutional issues, attempt to fathom why the firm as an issuer of securities would resort more to debt than equity. The structure of corporate finance in India is thus the result of a banking system that is protected against failure, oliogopolistic market structures with uncertainty regarding the demand for products. The financing strategy adopted by firms in such an environment, the author demonstrates, is part of an attempt to achieve market dominance.||Errol D'Souza

By putting a zero value on trees as timber, it encourages a shift to lower value uses and thus the mining of forest resources. Rather than restricting the notion of property rights of forest dwellers, as the Supreme Court ruling does, the international trend is towards increasing acceptance of property rights and the related commoditisation of the environmental services that forests (i e, the forest dwellers) provide to the external world. Finally, the Supreme Court order specifies that all sawmills should be located only in designated industrial estates. In practice what this would lead to is discrimination against the emerging local capitalist enterprises in favour of those operated by the bigger pan-Indian capitalists.||Dev Nathan

This is happening within and across national boundaries and has been described as teleworking, taking different forms. The development of teleworking represents a convergence between a number of different trends, many of which have major implications for environmental, social and economic policy. How industry, the governments, the policy-makers respond to these changes will seriously impact on the future of the economy, on the employment possibilities as well as the quality of work-life of people.||Swasti Mitter

The other patterns include a trade-off between poverty alleviation and conservation of the environment; necessary conservation which hurts the poor, at least in the short run; development which aggravates both poverty and environmental degradation; and persistent poverty helping the cause of the environment. There are also heartening instances of this cause prospering side by side with that of poverty alleviation.||M. V. Nadkarni

Through improvisations in traditional theatre, where times are at once fluid and interchangeable, and the ecology embedded in ritual cultural practices that ensures their continuity, the essay examines the anti-historical prejudice in colonialist readings of 'Indian time' in juxtaposition with fundamentalist readings of the 'Indian past'. Focusing on the social implications of the 'death of utopia' in the contexts of Kaliyuga and globalisation, the essay offers alternatives to the marketing of memory in Gandhi's affirmation of 'imaginary' villages, Krishnamurti's advocacy of the 'ending of time', and Lohia's envisioning of 'immediacy' in an 'interval during politics'. The essay suggests that a recognition of the mutations of time can begin only through a new alertness to its multiple enigmas.||Rustom Bharucha

Among our findings are: CPRs made up about 12 per cent of poor households' income; fuel and fodder were the most important CPRs accessed by the poor; and women and girls are mainly responsible for collection of CPRs, which may be why their importance to the poor is largely ignored. Poor people are being systematically excluded from customary access to CPRs, a key element in their livelihoods, at an alarming rate. The main causes of this exclusion are agricultural intensification, commoditisation of CPRs, environmental degradation and population growth. New forms of 'community' management of environmental resources, which have been promoted by governments and aid donors over the last 10 years, may add to the exclusion of the poor.||Tony Beck,Madan G.
