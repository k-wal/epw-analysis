As such, the knowledge revolution offers a unique chance to leapfrog entire stages of development. This paper argues that in order to make such a leap Tamil Nadu needs to initiate a knowledge-led development policy that builds on the state's successful IT industry. This paper proposes a roadmap to raise the global competitiveness of Tamil Nadu's IT industry, through strengthening both the demand and the supply.||Nirupam Bajpai,Navi Radjou

It looks at the role played by wastepickers in environment protection and conservation apart from their contribution to economic productivity. It explores the possibilities for legitimising the occupation with a view to improving the conditions of work. It also proposes a framework through which social security benefits can be assured to this section of workers. The article draws upon the authors' own research and experience of working with the Kagad Kach Patra Kashtakari Panchayat (Scrap Collectors Association) and the Department of Adult Education, SNDT Women's University, in Pune city.||Poornima Chikarmane,Lakshmi Narayan

Using forest use statistics this article shows that there has been a dramatic shift in the post-Chipko years away from state and commercial appropriation of forest resources. In the absence of visible conflicts, the everyday interaction between the state and local inhabitants has assumed greater importance and this everyday interaction is characterised by a critical difference between 'survival' and 'commercial' activities, as well as a difference in the management of resources that are perceived as 'stable-in-nature' (such as a fishery) and those that are perceived as 'flexible-in-nature' (such as a forest which can be cut down to make agricultural plots). These two differences form the basis for the construction of a 'moral' economy of the state as well as the sound management of common resources.

Results indicated that income distribution was less unequal in technologically 'developed villages' than in 'less developed villages'. Agriculture and/or rice income was more equally distributed than non-agriculture income. Thus, the diffusion of modern agricultural technology did not affect the distribution of agriculture income but rather reduced inequality of overall income distribution. Further, rural poverty was lower in technologically 'developed villages' than in 'less developed villages'.||Jawahar Thakur,Manik L. Bose,Mahabub Hossain,A. Janaiah

Using data from a field study in Garhwal, this article points out that the analysis on which this evidence is based does not take into account the economic environment at that time. Once the chronic shortage of labour in these economies is explicitly recognised, an alternative explanation for most 'institutions' of resource conservation, based on the need to conserve labour, can be provided. This challenges the prevailing view of the Garhwali inhabitant as traditionally 'conservationist', and has significant repercussions for policy.||Jishnu Das

The results show that in order to reduce rural poverty, the Indian government should give highest priority to additional investments in rural roads, agricultural research and education. These types of investment not only have much larger poverty impacts per rupee spent than any other government investment, but also generate higher productivity growth. Other investments (including irrigation, soil and water conservation, health, and rural and community development) have only modest impacts on growth and poverty per additional rupee spent.||Shenggen Fan,Peter Hazell,S.

The ecology-centred model emerged in answer, and emphasised the creation of more national parks and sanctuaries. Ironically, this also led to the displacement of a large number of native people and their further marginalisation and sufferings in social, economic and cultural terms. This paper discusses the case of displacement and resettlement of the 'maldharis' of the Gir forest in Gujarat, who were displaced and resettled in 1970s and 1980s as a result of creation of a sanctuary and later a national park in the Gir forest. The state government policy of resettlement had a negative view of the maldharis, and was neither well-conceived nor implemented systematically. At present, there is an eco-development project in the Gir protected area sponsored by the World Bank, which does not approve of forced relocation and provides for voluntary relocation in a participatory way. Accordingly, the state government stance has changed, but on an experimental basis and only for this one project.||Kameshwar Choudhary

This 'Gujarat model' rests on key assumptions about being able to shape and construct markets through policy intervention. In this paper, empirical comparative data on water markets in two villages shows instead that exchange processes are shaped by: hydro-geological factors which influence the risk of accessing water and the fixed costs of drilling wells; path dependence in the construction of irrigation infrastructure (wells and pipelines); and historical precedent and social norms which determine the institutional rules under which water is sold. But actual patterns of exchange rate shaped by complex local institutions. To understand how terms of exchange are structured and shaped over time requires attention to the micro-analytics of how real markets for groundwater actually function. Accordingly, the paper analyses local informal norms of exchange, and explores how they change over time.||Navroz K. Dubash

Moreover, Indian firms depend far more heavily on external debt as a source of finance than do firms in advanced countries. This paper argues that an adequate explanation for this would need to weave in two central issues - the institutional structure of the banking sector with government guarantees of stability and viability and the oligopolistic nature of maturing firms that are attempting to dominate the market. An explanation for the structure of corporate finance must, apart from institutional issues, attempt to fathom why the firm as an issuer of securities would resort more to debt than equity. The structure of corporate finance in India is thus the result of a banking system that is protected against failure, oliogopolistic market structures with uncertainty regarding the demand for products. The financing strategy adopted by firms in such an environment, the author demonstrates, is part of an attempt to achieve market dominance.||Errol D'Souza

By putting a zero value on trees as timber, it encourages a shift to lower value uses and thus the mining of forest resources. Rather than restricting the notion of property rights of forest dwellers, as the Supreme Court ruling does, the international trend is towards increasing acceptance of property rights and the related commoditisation of the environmental services that forests (i e, the forest dwellers) provide to the external world. Finally, the Supreme Court order specifies that all sawmills should be located only in designated industrial estates. In practice what this would lead to is discrimination against the emerging local capitalist enterprises in favour of those operated by the bigger pan-Indian capitalists.||Dev Nathan

Today more than three months after the abduction and with no clear end to the crisis, it is critical to take stock of this bizarre event, and its meanings within contemporary Indian political discourse. In the essays that follow, written before Rajkumar's release from captivity, three scholars from Karnataka, Madhava Prasad, Janaki Nair and Tejaswini Niranjana, offer their reflections on the event, on the history of Kannada nationalism and on the cultural productions that construct new meanings of the event, in an attempt to chart the emerging field of forces and its consequences for the shape of not just regional but national political life. In spite of its bizarre and irrational appearance, Rajkumar's abduction is a flash of lightning that reveals, momentarily, the makeshift hinges of the Indian political structure.||M. Madhava Prasad

Through improvisations in traditional theatre, where times are at once fluid and interchangeable, and the ecology embedded in ritual cultural practices that ensures their continuity, the essay examines the anti-historical prejudice in colonialist readings of 'Indian time' in juxtaposition with fundamentalist readings of the 'Indian past'. Focusing on the social implications of the 'death of utopia' in the contexts of Kaliyuga and globalisation, the essay offers alternatives to the marketing of memory in Gandhi's affirmation of 'imaginary' villages, Krishnamurti's advocacy of the 'ending of time', and Lohia's envisioning of 'immediacy' in an 'interval during politics'. The essay suggests that a recognition of the mutations of time can begin only through a new alertness to its multiple enigmas.||Rustom Bharucha

Among our findings are: CPRs made up about 12 per cent of poor households' income; fuel and fodder were the most important CPRs accessed by the poor; and women and girls are mainly responsible for collection of CPRs, which may be why their importance to the poor is largely ignored. Poor people are being systematically excluded from customary access to CPRs, a key element in their livelihoods, at an alarming rate. The main causes of this exclusion are agricultural intensification, commoditisation of CPRs, environmental degradation and population growth. New forms of 'community' management of environmental resources, which have been promoted by governments and aid donors over the last 10 years, may add to the exclusion of the poor.||Tony Beck,Madan G.

The need now is for a pro-active stance that would lead to a genuine devolution. This calls for an enhanced focus on skill development and capacity building for all the stakeholders involved - forest officials, NGOs and the local community that would facilitate a forward-looking and anticipatory approach, to forest management.||N.
