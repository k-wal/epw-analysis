This paper argues that human capital has continued to arrive in the United States from India in many guises.||Binod Khadria

The 1980s marked a major shift in government policy towards the industry. Several new steps were taken under the policy of liberalisation and modernisation and the industry was declared a thrust area for export promotion. This article looks at the different facets of the growth and structure of the industry, such as growth performance, market concentration and ancillarisation in the context of the policy changes.||Sukhpal Singh

To effectively confront the existing paradigm of English studies two questions which have significant implications for both literary theory and pedagogic practice are 'what is to be taught' in English departments and 'how to teach it'. This essay suggests that the ambivalent enterprise of teaching English in India could perhaps be re-evaluated, deflected and re-inflected through the reading of post-colonial texts whose incorporation into the existing paradigm should be resisted by refusing to employ customary ways of reading.||Tejaswini Niranjana
03/11/1990- ||special articles||4396933||Sickness and Growth of India's Textile Industry: Analysis and Policy Options||This article, in two parts, examines the current state of India's textile industry. In 1985 there was an inclination on the part of the government to take a close look at the status of the industry, and suggest methods of rationalisation. Nothing much was done and, if anything, the handloom and mill sectors are far worse off today than they were five years ago. The first part of the article examines the patterns and determinants of household demand for clothing. If the government feels the need to increase per capita purchase of textiles, then there is a strong case for altering relative prices of man-made fibres through a systematic reduction in tariffs. Part II looks at four important issues: powerlooms versus mills; powerlooms versus handlooms; rationalising the workforce in the mill sector; and the myth of modernisation. The data compels the conclusion that there is very little hope for most of the composite mills, especially the nationalised ones, in the face of competition from powerlooms. The options that exist are closely linked to rationalising the labour force which, in turn, requires a definite policy decision by the government backed up by an attractive voluntary retirement package-things that the government has chosen to ignore to the further detriment of the sector. Similarly, without heavy doses of subsidies, the share of the handloom sector is bound to shrink over time. The only winners seem to be the powerloom sector, with its striking cost advantages.

01/9/1990-08/9/1990||special articles||4396711||Kerala Economy at the Crossroads?||Implicit in the development experience of Kerala is the question of the capability of low income agrarian societies to achieve high quality of living levels. This issue is crucial for two reasons. One is related to the sustainability of the kind of social development achieved and the other is the imperative of a more all-round pattern of development. The set of articles presented in this and the following issue are, therefore, addressed to the crucial question of the economic performance of Kerala against the background of its achievements in the social sphere. While a fair amount of literature exists on Kerala's achievements in the sphere of social development, studies on the performance of the directly productive sectors of the economy are still inadequate. These papers constitute an effort to fill a part of this gap in the state of knowledge on the Kerala economy. In this paper an attempt is made to provide, in a preliminary fashion, an analytical framework within which the stagnation/slow growth of the directly productive sectors of Kerala's economy can be understood. Section II of the paper presents a picture of the nature of economic growth in Kerala in terms of the three broad sectors and the following section looks at the continuing constraints on economic growth and development with the focus on the disjunction between labour productivity and product wages, caused probably by the impact of the sudden increase in the flow of remittances since the mid-seventies, which might also explain the relatively fast growth of the tertiary sector.||K.

However, what one discovers is only a veneer of socialism covering a hard core of pragmatism. While pragmatism is no dirty word in today's world, the finance minister was obviously unwilling to consider a little bit of that other non-dirty word, namely, perestroika, in his budget. There is little evidence of any desire to bring about significant restructuring in the fiscal strategy of the union government, a strategy that the National Front has itself been critical about. What we have on offer is a budget of continuity rather than change.||Sanjaya Baru

07/7/1990- ||special articles||4396474||Mirabai and the Spiritual Economy of Bhakti||In an economy where the labour of women and the surplus production of the peasant and artisan are customarily and 'naturally' appropriated by the ruling groups, the high Hindu traditions sought to encompass and retain the management of spiritual 'surplus', and to circumscribe its availability along lines of caste and gender. In this spiritual economy, the liberalising and dissenting forms of bhakti emerge as a powerful force which selectively uses the metaphysic of high Hinduism in an attempt to create an inappropriable excess or transcendent value grounded in the dailiness of a material life within the reach of all. This paper attempts to understand the specific character of Mirabai's bhakti as it finds shape within the overlapping yet contradictory configuration of the patriarchal assumptions of the medieval Rajput state, prescriptive brahminical texts, and the female devotional voice as it develops in earlier and contemporary compositions of male bhaktas. What emerges is, firstly, that though the prescriptions of the smritis and puranas do not survive as law, they are available as ideology which shapes the customary domain and self-description of Rajput ruling groups and constitute the historical moment in which Mira lives. Secondly, in the breaking and remaking of patriarchal relations, Mira's bhakti marks as well as belongs to a longer historical moment in which the prescriptions of the smritis and puranas are selectively internalised, and the customary nexus of religious practice is translated into metaphors and emotional structures. Thirdly, though Mira's compositions are themselves ambivalently situated, there are significant differences in her personal practice and in her ideological location when compared to earlier and contemporary male bhaktas. And, finally, etched into Mira's enterprise is not only the difficulty of being 'original' in an oral tradition, but also the recalcitrance and the precariousness of personal rebellion.

Because of the numbers involved and its complexities it also overwhelmed the capacity of the macrosystem, that is, the social and administrative structures to respond. An epidemiological perspective and method of study is vital to understanding the pattern and distribution of the adverse outcomes in the community and can provide a variety of data.

31/3/1990- ||review of agriculture, march 1990||4396098||Crop Rotation in Traditional Farming Systems in Selected Areas of India||Crop rotation is an important feature of traditional farming systems in the semi-arid tropics. Using farm-level data on plot-specific cropping histories covering a period of 10 years, the paper discusses different dimensions of rotation practices in three agro-climatic regions of SAT India. Despite realising the importance of rotation, the farmer finds it difficult to rotate crops or cropping systems as he wants. Weather, market forces, and other factors tend to interrupt the rotation sequences. By sensitising agro-biological research on crop rotations to these factors, new options for rotation can be made more relevant to the farm-level realities, which in turn can help in their easy adoption by the farmer. Cultivars with different maturity periods, suitable for intercropping systems, can help generate more options for effective crop rotations.||N. S. Jodha,R. P. Singh

Simultaneously, it should favour crops which are either efficient import substitutes or exportables to save (earn) foreign exchange in balance.

It argues that there is a critical silence ubiquitously present in all their works, that essentially constitutes a kind of theorisation which has insidiously erased from its corpus the criteria of class/mass struggle communism and the distinction between potentiality and actuality. This paper argues that this omnipresent silence, characterised as 'reification'-the process of losing sight of vital criteria of knowledge-engenders a significant crisis in Marxist theory which can be overcome only by breaking the silence inherent in their theorisation proper.||Arun K.

It is shown that, the two selves of the mill worker-of the peasant and of the worker-were both situated in contexts where colonialism was the biggest determinant. The peasant in north Bihar could experience for himself the tacit alliance between the state, the planter and the landlord operating in his daily life. When he came to the city, he again could see a different version of the same alliance dominating him. It is in this context that the jute mill workers' communal involvement should be placed. His community orientation may have been part of his pre-bourgeois self, but this was no unalloyed extra-colonial nativity. On the contrary, it functioned within the colonial framework, and blossomed under its dispensation.||Parimal Ghosh

A sample of about 30 assets is considered, including the most popular savings instruments. It is found that the ranking of assets after income taxes differs across tax brackets, which implies a distortionary tax system. Further-more, tax deductions favour upper bracket taxpayers the most, so much so that tax incentives for savings may end up discouraging saving in higher brackets due to excessive subsidies. It is also shown that the term structure of interest rates displays only a weakly increasing pattern as the holding period increases. The treatment of assets under current tax practice is also compared to proportional expenditure taxes using the Index of Fiscal Privilege. Budgetary implications of tax concessions are analysed and found, in many cases, to be a cause for concern. Some comments on the implications of these findings for investment and government debt are also made.||A. Das-Gupta

The increases over the previous budget in market borrowings of the central government and of subsidies, not to mention the increase in defence spending, hardly reverse the trends initiated by the previous regime. Nor is there reason to believe that the inflation rate is going to be lower despite the reduction in the estimated deficit. However, the budget contains the germ of sensible thinking on some longer term issues concerning the relationship between targets and instruments. Here the finance minister has shown himself to be pragmatic and refreshingly non-doctrinaire. But he cannot hope to maintain the present stance towards agriculture next time round.||Pulapre Balakrishnan

This is more so in the relatively high-risk, low-productivity areas such as the arid and semi-arid tropical regions of India. Historically, (i) the presence of factors less favourable to rapid privatisation of land resources; (ii) community level concerns for collective sustenance and ecological fragility; and (iii) dependence of private resource based farming on the collective risk sharing arrangements, constituted circumstances favourable to the institution of common property resources in these areas. CPRs in turn contribute to the production and consumption needs of rural communities in several ways. However, notwithstanding their private contributions CPRs are faced with a serious crisis, as reflected by their area shrinkage, productivity decline, and management collapse. This article, based on field studies of CPRs in the dry tropical regions of India, presents micro-level evidence on contributions of CPRs, their present crisis, and future prospects.||N. S. Jodha

The analysis is confined to the southern region particularly the state of Andhra Pradesh. The aim of the paper is to highlight the irrigation policy of the colonial administration which led to skewed development. The forces of colonial exploitation extended to the farmlevel during the second half of the 19th century. As their main objective was to shift as much surplus as possible from the periphery to the centre, the administration had to concentrate on relatively better endowed regions where extortion was easy. In the process backward regions were neglected.||V. Ratna Reddy

Useful as they are in indicating some broad trends, these forecasts are unable to capture variations between crops, regions, operations and levels of technology used. The disaggregated energy demand forecasts are more meaningful for policy decisions. The present study is limited to only commercial or conventional form of energy, that is, electricity and petroleum products. Also, the energy demand estimations are restricted to six major crops, viz, paddy, wheat, sugarcane, cotton, oilseeds and pulses. In terms of energy inputs into agriculture, the demand estimations are made in relation to land preparation, fertiliser (NPK), pumping irrigation, harvesting (including transport from farm to village) and threshing (relevant for paddy and wheat only).||T.

They came into being on account of decisions in the former princely states to wind up departmental activities and organise them in the form of autonomous public enterprises. SLPEs have become a potent tool in the hands of state governments to implement public policy and account for a significant share of state capital outlays. This paper investigates whether such enterprises can earn a rate of return and if so, what can be done to achieve the same.||T. L. Sankar,R. K. Mishra,R. Nandagopal

In particular, the attempt at linking transfers to offset the fiscal disadvantages of states is noteworthy. However, the commission has missed the opportunity to make an integrated assessment of the revenue accounts of the states. The continued adherence to the compartmentalised approach to assessing the plan and non-plan sides of the states' budgets is clearly a disappointment. Also, it is doubtful that the states and the centre will adhere to the plan of phasing our revenue deficits. While non-adherence by the states will largely reduce their investments, that by the centre will hurt the economy as a whole.||M. Govinda Rao

28/7/1990- ||special articles||4396561||Costs of German Unity||The debate on German unification has deeper ideological implications. Contrary to the fond hope of innumerable socialists in the not-too-distant past, international capitalism today is not only vibrant, but also seems to be ousting in peaceful competition 'existing socialisms' from countries stretching from China through the USSR to East Germany. In some ways developments in East Germany will be crucial. Apart from being the most prosperous country in East Europe, the GDR's growth record has been respectable, and she has avoided the fate of her neighbours groaning under enormous debts in hard currency. Yet should her industries, after unification, be either swept away in the torrent of competition or turned into branch plants belonging to West German companies, and should her population survive on West German charity, it could be a major blow against socialism or, indeed, any form of non-capitalist development. This is the not-so-hidden agenda behind the speculation on the huge costs of German unification. The perspective changes drastically if it so happens that the East Germans are able to manage on their own without western subsidies, and a good part of their industry maintains its own identity in the competitive market place. Which scenario will prevail, time alone can tell.||Nirmal Kumar Chandra

For it is these lists, and not any other arrived at after proper enumeration, which have been used to fill the three backward classes categories envisaged by the Constitution.

21/7/1990- ||special articles||4396527||Socialism at the End of the Century: Reflections on an Epoch Passed||The Russian Revolution of 1917 fashioned the contours of a new global epoch. The conclusive termination of this epoch by the events of 1989 and the transition to a new historical time have generated a crisis of Marxism. The project of renewal of Marxism and the identification of its sources demand a response in terms of a fundamental re-evaluation of the project undertaken in the name of socialism for the past seven decades. To this end the present essay makes an attempt to comprehend the crisis through an examination of the developments in the Soviet Union since 1917. Proceeding from an examination of the Bolshevik experience the study traces the defeat of the revolution and inauguration of Stalinism to the unreconciled disjunctions in the theory and practice of the Bolshevik paradigm. Positing a distinction between early Stalinism (1929-39) and late Stalinism (post-45) when the system moves into crisis the paper studies the consolidation of Stalinism through the collectivisation and industrialisation drives. The industrialisation of the 1930s is seen to have shaped the emergence of a social formation in the logic of which inhered waste, low productivity, absence of innovation and worker apathy and whose constitutive relations of production were mediated through tripartite links between workers, managers and the state. It is in these relations of production that the genetic origin of the extant crisis is located. Comments on the crisis of late Stalinism from Khrushchev to Gorbachev are followed by discussion of the impact of the crisis on the Indian left. The essay concludes with observations on the prospects for socialism at this juncture. [The paper is published in two parts. The second part will appear next week. References are appended to part two.]||Krishnendu Ray,Ravi Sundaram

This evolution was marked by staying power, a capacity to encounter volatile configurations of power and flexibility to incorporate changes demanded by circumstances. A combination of circumstances such as the urge to follow an independent foreign policy, the pragmatic choice of befriending a powerful socialist state like the USSR and commitment to promote peace shaped the concept as well as the praxis of non-alignment. In the process of its evolution, non-alignment inspired smaller Afro-Asian states striving to carve out their identities in a world torn between stereotype social systems. The eventual merger of these states within the mainstream of the non-aligned movement transformed the movement's principal concerns from east-west tensions to north-south issues and the new international economic order.||Rajen Harshe

01/9/1990-08/9/1990||special articles||4396714||Dissecting Agricultural Stagnation in Kerala: An Analysis across Crops, Seasons and Regions||The authors' analysis indicates that the yield stagnation in agriculture in Kerala is all-pervasive, including in paddy. The observed increase in yield of paddy is not due to any technical change, but to marginal land going out of cultivation. There is thus technological stagnation throughout Kerala's agriculture since the mid-seventies. Farmers have, moreover, resorted to increased mixed cropping to minimise earnings fluctuation from a given acreage. The most important component of any strategy for agricultural development of Kerala is, therefore, to make technical change as the main source of growth. Given the intensity of land-use, cropping pattern, abolition of intermediation through land reforms, existence of a network of agricultural research, extension and credit services and, above all, the relatively higher level of education among the farming community and their receptiveness to new ideas, Kerala's agriculture seems to have reached a threshold warranting an induced innovation strategy so as to break out of its technological stagnation.||K.

Intellectuals are very sensitive to changes in power. Intellectual shifts between the 1960s and 1980s reflect the changes in the relationship of power. The fundamental paradox of our time, however, is that the tilts in power are not accompanied by the consolidation and expansion of capitalist economic and social systems: the fragility of western economies, the disintegration of the inner cities, the volatility of the financial markets, the polarisation of classes and regions of the world economy, the destruction of the environment all speak to the failure of capitalism to solve any of the basic problems posed by Marxism. If the retreat of the intellectuals is largely a product of shifts in power and if the economic foundations of that power are indeed fragile, we can expect a new cycle of radicalisation with the next economic crises and resurgence of popular power.||James Petras

It is also important to identify the lessons the financial change and innovation in foreign markets offer to countries like India in shaping our future financial policies. The main issues discussed in this paper are (1) national differences in the approach to financial innovation, (2) the main causes of financial innovation and the future outlook, (3) the cost-benefit aspects of financial innovation, and (4) the lessons for India.||S.

The category of structural factors has here been broadened to include not only industrial composition but also variations of the industrial sector in terms of its organisation-household industries, organised industries, and size of factories. It is the author's contention that regional factors have retarded industrialisation in Kerala. If the regional factors had not been so adverse, the structural factors should have in fact raised the rate of industrial growth in Kerala above the all-India rate.||Alice Albin

Child nutrition indicators may not be good calibrators for anti-poverty targeting, and vice versa, if such a misfit is widespread. A number of reasons have been advanced to account for relationships of misfit between poverty and malnutrition. All such reasons concern the interpretive significance of indicators and concepts used. If these explanations can be taken as hypotheses with which the relation between material conditions and nutritional welfare may be explored, it would follow that considerable empirical variation is possible and that empirical specification is necessary. This article has taken, for comparison and contrast, two localities at extremes of their food systems. At the start of a food system is a set of four small hamlets near Warangal. By contrast, at the end of a food system, festers a slum in the port city of Khulna in Bangladesh.||Barbara Harriss,Stuart Gillespie,Jane Pryer

Extending over a period of more than fifty years (1935-1988) these novels reveal the material powerlessness of the mother while she is eulogised as life-giver and nurturer, as individual, as country, as goddess. They expose the tremendous ideological burden which the individual woman has to bear and act out and also capture the stirrings of female discontent against such role-constructs.||Sangeeta Dutta

25/8/1990- ||review of industry and management, august 1990||4396679||Outline of an IR Theory of Industrial Conflict||Focusing on Bombay, locations around Bombay and more distant labour market areas in the state and on the basis of a sample of about 180 plants or other establishments controlled by 125 companies belonging largely to the private sector, this paper elaborates an industrial relations theory of industrial conflict. Conflict is seen as part of a bargaining process and the notion that the strike experience of individual plants is determined fundamentally by the industry to which they belong is rejected. Conflict is seen as belonging not to the plant itself but to its experience and the space described is phenomenological and not objective. Consequently there is no determinism which can explicate a pattern of conflict and the diversity of available choices does not bind workers to set responses. Likewise even if management behaviour conforms to certain determinisms even managers have choices. The study concentrates on plants in manufacturing sectors which may be called 'modern', that is, whose evolution was a product of the industrial expansion of the 1950s.||Jairus Banaji,Rohini Hensman

Due to paucity of funds, there has been deceleration in the state's plan expenditure in recent years. This along with other exogenous factors have contributed to a slow expansion of the state's resource base. As a result, the own resources of the state are inadequate, despite larger resource mobilisation efforts, to meet even its current non-plan commitments. The absence of any surplus on non-plan account has led to the reduction in size of the state's plans, given the present formula for determining state's plan outlays. A major policy change is called for to get Kerala, as well as other backward states, out of this vicious circle of small volume of resources, small plan outlays and small resource base.||K. K. George

This article systematically explores the employment potential in the rural areas with particular emphasis on agriculture and allied sectors. It attempts an analysis of trends in distribution of operational holdings on the basis of the available time series data. The employment potential of animal husbandry and allied activities and their spatial distribution are also discussed, and a later section deals with the irrigation resources of the country and their regional distribution. A detailed analysis of labour absorption in the crop sector on the basis of cost of cultivation data for all the major crops in the country is presented with a discussion of issues emerging from the present analysis which have a bearing on public policy planning for the current decade.||N.

The issues involved in the controversy include the non-viability of the RRBs and the question of parity of their staffs' pay scales and service conditions with those of commercial banks. One influential view that emerged advocated merger of the RRBs with their sponsor banks. However many other important issues involved have been, by and large, glossed over.

On the basis of an efficiency analysis of the different modes of transport the paper concludes that inland water transport has benefits to offer which are not being adequately exploited due to the decline that this particular mode has undergone on account of government neglect. The paper makes a plea for the revival of inland water transport and an increase in the share of rail traffic in order to remove the high burden on the road transport system.||K. P. Sunny

24/11/1990- ||review of industry and management, november 1990||4397023||Cost and Time Overruns in Public Sector Projects||Delays and cost overruns in public sector investments can raise the capital-output ratio in the sector and elsewhere, bringing down the efficacy of investments. Yet there are no estimates of the delays and cost overruns, and of their opportunity cost. This study arrives at rough estimates of the delays and cost overruns, and the opportunity cost in terms of the extra 'capital X time' that is used up. Cost overruns (at 80 per cent) and the extra 'capital X time' incurred (about 190 per cent) are very large; even after removing the increase due to inflation. The reasons for this are also identified and rated. Factors internal to the public sector system and government largely account for the delays and cost overruns: Poor project design and implementation, inadequate funding of projects, bureaucratic indecision, and the lack of co-ordination between enterprises. Appraisal by the government very often is devoid of meaning when the emphasis is only on the form of the project proposal rather than on its content. Since public enterprises particularly those in the core sector have large dealings with each other, a 'vicious circle of delays' has been built up. The politically expedient tendency to take up large numbers of projects and short fund them all, except those with the very highest priority, is perhaps the most important factor in delays. The government's ad hoc approach in according high priority to certain sectors-oil and natural gas, and petroleum-while perhaps overcoming the problem in these sectors have compounded the problem elsewhere, particularly in the infra-structural areas-railways, coal and steel.||Sebastian Morris

Policy signals have also emphasised a modernisation of consumption almost at the cost of, or at least in preference to, the modernisation of the production structure of the economy. Finally, by relying almost exclusively on non-tariff forms of protection at high rates, in conjunction with increasing delicensing of entry, the policy has led to excessive entry, high costs of production and lack of competitive quality in domestic industries. There is no easy method by which the concerned industries can now be brought back to the path of international competitiveness. Yet this has to be achieved if Indian industrialisation is not to be a saga of high costs, loss of consumer welfare and dependence on government subsidies and protection barriers. It is necessary, therefore, to initiate a shift towards a tariff-based regime of protection for industries. Policy measures should encourage industries which are in line with the country's comparative advantage and are based on broader segments of domestic demand.||Vijay L. Kelkar,Rajiv Kumar

What is needed is a more comprehensive and radically new paradigm for an alternative approach to health care. Two critical approaches are outlined here: the older political economy critique and the newer socio-cultural one. Both have their implicit assumptions and specific concerns. The 'social medicine' urged by the first and the 'holistic health' defined by the second are complementary rather than contrary. For only when our medicine is genuinely 'social' can we really have 'health for all', and only if this health is authentically 'holistic' can we truly be 'healthy people'.||Rudolf C. Heredia

The data were analysed using the Women as Managers Scale (WAMS), developed by researchers in the United States to measure bias.

21/4/1990- ||special articles||4396185||Money, Output and Prices: A Macro Econometric Model||This paper presents an econometric model of the Indian economy which emphasises the interrelationships among money, output and prices. The main linkages in the model are as follows: The stock of money varies endogenously through the feedback from reserve money, which changes to accommodate fiscal deficits. The price level is determined by money supply and output. The government budget is affected by the price level and output. The latter is influenced, among other factors, by changes in real money supply acting as a proxy for real credit. The empirical results show that the price effects of an increase in money supply are stronger than the output effects. Since government revenue collections do not keep pace with government expenditures as nominal incomes rise, the resource gap widens during a period of continued price increases. The policy simulations show that while a substantial increase in government capital expenditures increases output, its impact on output and prices also depends on the extent of the resource gap met by borrowing from the Reserve Bank. As the proportion of the resource gap met by borrowing from the Reserve Bank increases, the trade-off between output and prices worsens sharply.||C. Rangarajan,R. R. Arif

The opposite of the homogenisation launched by the state becomes plurality, the counterposition of standardisation becomes distinctiveness and variation, the inversion of class becomes 'people' and the reverse of macro-processes becomes micro-episodes. This paper argues that there can be no understanding of the significance of class struggles unless we refer to political economy, and political economy of the state is bereft of substance unless seen as the product of class struggles. Thus attention needs to be paid to locating the state in civil society, seeing it as the focus of class struggles but not viewing the state as the ultimate domain where class struggles are resolved. We do not then need an 'anti-essential' post-Marxism to understand civil society. We need to return to classical Marxism, to class struggle being the force of history and to looking at the specificity of oppression and resistance.||Neera Chandhoke

Against this background, this paper analyses the short-term dynamics of budget deficit, money supply, inflation and economic growth in the Indian context. The study, first, assesses the validity of the hypothesis of inflation-induced deficits in the Indian context and, having found empirical support for the phenomenon, takes a closer look at the modelling efforts for capturing the inter-relationships among budget deficit, money supply, inflation and economic growth and identifies several feedback effects which are conspicuous by their absence in these efforts. The authors then make an exploratory attempt to develop a more elaborate econometric model. The model is estimated with Indian data covering the period 1970-71 to 1987-88 with satisfactory results. Static and dynamic simulations are also conducted to assess the overall tracking ability of the model.||Narendra Jadhav,Balwant Singh

Noting the inadequacy of the existing protection afforded to local technology, this paper argues that such protection needs to be complemented by price protection.||Nagesh Kumar

But with the introduction and development of the new capitalist forces of production these blocks have undergone a fundamental change. From being a hereditary unity of caste and occupations they have become a unity of this old contradiction plus the new contradiction of caste and class. This basic contradiction in Indian society can be resolved neither by subjectively subtracting the old contradiction from the new one nor by excluding either class or caste from the new set of opposites. The methodology proposed by the Mandal Commission is appropriate for identifying backward castes, but not for abolishing castes. The problem of defining the present contradictory unity of caste and class, not in isolation from each other but in inseparable relation to each other, remains unresolved.||Sharad Patil

Thus far, these have been restricted to choices between supply options in particular, centralised energy technologies. But, this restriction to centralised sources is running into two major difficulties: (a) shortages of capital, and (b) popular opposition to the resulting local and global environmental degradation. Furthermore, what matters to a consumer of energy is not energy per se, but the services that energy provides. Hence, the true indicator of development is not the magnitude of energy used, but the level of energy services provided. It has, therefore, become essential to extend the list of options for energy decision-making so as to include both decentralised sources of supply, and energy efficiency improvements and other conservation options. This paper, therefore, attempts a comparative costing of electricity generating and saving technologies. The treatment covers the centralised technologies of nuclear power plants (CANDU type), coal-based thermal power plants, hydroelectric plants and natural-gas-based thermal power plants, the decentralised technologies of small hydroelectric plants, biogas-driven gensets, producer gas-driven gensets, diesel gensets and wind farms, and conservation technologies involving solar water heaters, improved irrigation pumpsets, replacement of standard motors with efficient motors, replacement of incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps, solar ponds, and cogeneration in sugar factories.||Amulya Kumar N.

For this purpose, demand functions have been estimated for various petroleum products, and an import function has been estimated for petroleum. The results of the analysis indicate that the gap between domestic demand for petroleum products and domestic production of crude oil is the main determinant of petroleum imports. International price of petroleum and the foreign exchange availability also exert some influence on the government's decision to import petroleum. An important finding of the study is that both domestic demand for petroleum products and import demand for petroleum are not much responsive to price changes.||Bishwanath Goldar,Hiranya Mukhopadhyay

Identification of the critical constraints on the expansion of the material commodity producing sectors is thus not only of relevance for policy-making but may even point to alternative development paradigms. Keeping this in view, the growth experience of manufacture in the factory sector in Kerala is attempted in this paper.||K. K. Subrahmanian

27/1/1990- ||review of political economy, january 1990||4395872||The 1990s: Decade of Global Economic and Political Crisis||The centrally-planned states of the east, while professing socialism, harbour fundamental social contradictions between the working class and the bureaucratic ruling elites. The bursting of the bubble in eastern Europe and momentarily in China confirms the political and economic crisis of statism. However, the advanced capitalist countries of the west too bear not only fundamental social contradictions, but also unprecedented imbalances which threaten to burst the bubble of relative prosperity. The global debt crisis, burgeoning government deficits, escalating bank failures, increasing volatility in securities markets, and widening disparities in the distribution of wealth threaten world economic stability and are likely to precipitate a great depression in the 1990s. Avoidance of a depression necessitates fundamental economic changes in the west in general, and the US in particular, which their ruling elites are unlikely to either recognise or accept. The consequences of the dual crises in the east and west will be political upheaval and profound economic changes in both camps.||Sharat G. Lin

There is as much disagreement among them about it now as there was in the past, even though they have trimmed their ambitions considerably about what they can expect from such a method in the study of society and culture. However, while it is doubtful that we will ever have a comparative method, like some ideal method of the natural scientists, about whose proper use sociologists and social anthropologists will reach complete agreement, it is a fact that our deepest insights into society and culture are reached in and through comparison. We have to improvise and to exercise our judgment as well as our imagination, and beyond that we can only hope that our comparisons-as well as our contrasts-will be illuminating and fruitful. At any rate, it will be futile to suspend our comparisons until the perfect classification or the perfect typology of human societies is placed within our grasp.||Andre Beteille

This would be especially true of low rainfall, water scarce and drought prone states like Maharashtra, which may present a picture completely different from the all-India one. This study is an attempt at an inter-regional time series analysis of agricultural production in Maharashtra for the period 1956-57 through 1984-85. It specifically examines the growth rates in production, area and yield of foodgrains; the variability in production, area and yield of these crops; trends in instability in the production of foodgrains and other crops; relationship between growth and instability and the impact of irrigation on the variability in crop production.||Ashok K.

10/11/1990- ||special articles||4396966||Sickness and Growth of India's Textile Industry: Analysis and Policy Options||This article, in two parts, examines the current state of India's textile industry. In 1985 there was an inclination on the part of the government to take a close look at the status of the industry, and suggest methods of rationalisation. Nothing much was done and, if anything, the handloom and mill sectors are far worse off today than they were five years ago. The first part of the article examines the patterns and determinants of household demand for clothing. If the government feels the need to increase per capita purchase of textiles, then there is a strong case for altering relative prices of man-made fibres through a systematic reduction in tariffs. Part II looks at four important issues: powerlooms versus mills; powerlooms versus handlooms; rationalising the workforce in the mill sector; and the myth of modernisation. The data compels the conclusion that there is very little hope for most of the composite mills, especially the nationalised ones, in the face of competition from powerlooms. The options that exist are closely linked to rationalising the labour force which, in turn, requires a definite policy decision by the government backed up by an attractive voluntary retirement package-things that the government has chosen to ignore to the further detriment of the sector. Similarly, without heavy doses of subsidies, the share of the handloom sector is bound to shrink over time. The only winners seem to be the powerloom sector, with its striking cost advantages.

The long hours of work in the mills exhausted the workers both physically and mentally. The physical environment of their homes was no better; neglected by the authorities and exploited by private builders, the workers lived in ill-lighted, ill-ventilated dens in largely undeveloped, undrained areas. To find solace from this hard life of labour the workers often resorted to alcohol drinking. The regular intake of alcohol coupled with their hard work in the mills and the polluted atmosphere both at home and in the mills weakened their resistance and made them easy prey to various diseases. The lack of organised labour activity during the period under study was also attributable to the grim daily routine of the workers.||Shashi Bhushan Upadhyay

Those who are broadly in sympathy with the thrusts of the National Front's economic policy, particularly the need to change the growth and development policies of the immediate past, will therefore be disappointed. Change doesn't happen: it has to be carefully planned for, and decisively brought about. In the days to come when the administration moves into its next concrete statement on economic policy-the draft of the Eighth Five-Year Plan-many will watch to see whether it is all wind or whether there is discernible evidence of directional change.||C.

Holding that the use of market under socialism is but an instrumental step, he underlines that the two cannot be put at par. While he may be correct in terms of formal logic, this does not really shed any light on the basic problem. In reality, both democracy and market are instrumental to socialism, although certainly of different orders.||Ajit Roy

These include general decline of the national political economy along with a general increase in the rates of profit of particular corporate groups, world-wide decline of American political influence and global acceptance of its 'free market' discourse, the harnessing of US technology by Japanese and European investors increasing foreign takeovers of American productive units. Arguing against the use of non-class categories and in discussions of the US decline the author suggests that it is a class determined and class experienced crisis.||James Petras

The 21-day general strike in princely Mysore's Kolar Gold Fields in 1930 reveals an incomplete hegemony process of outside organisations and ideology and constitutes a historical moment when the forces contesting each other to represent workers achieved a degree of unanimity on the question of who should speak for the working class.

20/1/1990- ||special articles||4395844||Bombay Metropolitan Region: Some Issues in Spatial Development||Eventhough academic studies highlight the need for integrated development of metropolitan regions, they show a bias towards development of urban fringe, and rural peripheries have often been neglected. Such development measures are, however, in the form of palliatives rather than a final solution. It is necessary to lay special emphasis on the development of rural peripheries which are expected to provide ecological cushioning for the cities. This alone would bring in the necessary cohesion in metropolitan regional development. The present paper analyses the nature of evolution of the Bombay region and suggests some ways in which the integration could be brought about. The development of rural hinterland cannot be achieved by superimposing new activities on it but by making residents effectively participate in the existing city-oriented activities. Some institutional changes are suggested for the purpose.||V. S. Phadke

Though their mandate is for a real change, the political philosophy of the group as a whole is too vague to permit bold policy initiatives. That is why one finds so much emphasis on continuity and consensus, instead of imaginative advances in new directions. Further, the bureaucracy, which has been as much responsible for the country's ills as the political leaders, continues to rule the roost. Leave alone any basic administrative reform, what is alarming is the naive faith of the new government leaders in the bureaucracy as a neutral and efficient instrument of change.||H. K. Paranjape

The woman was the human counterpart of land in a patriarchally organised agricultural society-a passive factor of reproduction. Such a society placed a premium on sons as potential producers and as inheritors of property. Motherhood however came to be increasingly glorified as compensation for an imposed reality in which women merely gratified society's preference for male progeny. The texts suggest that in rituals associated with marriage, conception, gestation and birth as also in the upbringing of the child the woman was overshadowed by the man-all that was permitted to the mother were acts of self-sacrifice and ritual observances for the well being of the father and son.||Sukumari Bhattacharji

Through a study of the Namasudra-Muslim disturbances that occurred in May 1911 in the Jessore-Khulna region of eastern Bengal, the paper argues that collective action was imperative for submerged groups to establish their self-image and, in the process, they repudiated accepted norms of reverence, leading to friction, both violent and non-violent, with those accustomed to being revered.||Sekhar Bandyopadhyay

Firstly, the behaviour of the nominal exchange rate bears little relationship to the behaviour of the real exchange rate or to important domestic price ratios such as the relative prices of traded and non-traded goods which provide the mechanism through which balance of payment adjustment is meant to occur. Secondly, a policy of continuous nominal devaluation creates expectations of future depreciation which in turn operate to increase current import expenditure and exert other negative influences on the current account. Thirdly, even the real exchange rate does not appear to be a major factor in determining export growth, which appears to be more strongly related to real economic variables.||Jayati Ghosh

Artisanal fishermen adversely affected by this responded at two levels-organised protest against destructive fishing and the adoption of new technology to enhance their declining harvest. The result has been the ruinous overuse of a common property resource. This paper examines the combination of economic, technological and social factors operating in a specific context that has led to this overuse and highlights the deleterious consequences of this to the marine eco-system and concludes with suggestions for resolving the crisis.||John Kurien,T.

The experiences of these countries vary. The liberalisation of the financial systems in some countries led to financial collapse and the return to controls. In some others it succeeded, though in varying degrees, in improving the quality and lowering the cost of financial services and in raising growth rates. While we all have much yet to learn about the design and execution of financial liberalisation, some preliminary lessons can be gleaned from recent experience.

This result is found to hold even when the observation for 1979-80 (a statistical outlier) is dropped. Moreover, the statistically significant break with a positive sign since 1979-80 also is evident for GDP excluding 'public administration and defence'; and even after adjusting for the observed lowering of the growth of the latter in the revised (with 1980-81 as the base year) series of National Accounts Statistics.||R.

It uses farm-level data from four periods commencing with the 1880s in order to study the variations in labour used for different crops. The evidence suggests that agriculturally progressive areas showed declines in labour intensity by the 1950s, while increases are observable elsewhere.

These may relate to differences in property holdings, in what may be called capability-skills, qualifications, etc-or variations of income from occupation to occupation or the effect of family composition in terms not only of age and sex but more crucially earners and dependants on income. This paper investigates three problems in this area: how much does income vary among persons of comparable educational qualifications due to the fact of their being employed by different employers? To what extent does the inequality of per capita family income differ from that of income earned by earners individually? How do differences in level of living relate to differences in per capita family income?||Sukla Chatterjee,Ashok Rudra

Noting the limitations of attributing the improved growth rate mainly (or solely) to an increase in the output of consumer durables and/or to the (once over) changes in the policies, the paper then attempts to explore the possible 'real' factors to account for the observed phenomenon in the context of the debate on industrial growth and 'stagnation'. A re-examination of some of the prominent hypotheses in the light of the experience of the eighties suggests (a) some favourable changes in the composition of capital formation, (b) an improvement in the rate and structure of public investment in general and (perhaps as a result of it) performance of infrastructure industries in particular, and (c) a reversal of the adverse movement in intersectoral terms of trade; all of which could have favourably contributed to the observed higher growth rate of the manufacturing sector. Highlighting some of the (micro economic or sectoral) areas of concern for sustaining the improved industrial performance, this study concludes by raising a few issues having a bearing on policy for further enquiry.||R.

In this context, certain striking features of the Indian developmental experience, which should find a reflection in analytical exercises, are taken note of.||Krishna Bharadwaj

Most of the studies examining the issue relate to the all-India rural sector. But since the green revolution has not spread evenly in all the regions, the changes in the level of poverty reported in these studies do not strictly relate to the phenomenon. Haryana is one of those few regions where new agricultural technology has spread more widely than others and therefore the experience of its farmers should provide us a better picture of how poverty among farmers changes with the spread of new farming technology.||Satya Paul

Aggregate terms of trade, it is argued, do not seem to enter as such in the calculus of farmers' production decisions. On the other hand, real factors which promote growth of crop yields and which impart relative stability to agriculture have a deciding influence on profitability of agriculture. Perhaps the causality is from production to terms of trade.||R. Thamarajakshi

In this empirical study, the pattern and nature of control exercised by the Indian parents, local parties, and possible transnational capital and local-government equity participants is estimated and analysed. Indian control over the 'joint ventures' is quite large, larger than what the average 30 per cent Indian participation may seem to indicate. There is little portfolio investment from Indian firms. Transnational capital based in India has hardly ventured abroad, yet indigenous capital when it had the entrepreneurial initiative has extensively collaborated with transnational corporations, chiefly in the larger ventures abroad. Collaborations with local governments have also helped the Indian parents to exercise control over large enterprises with much less financial commitment and with little interference from the governments. While the larger business houses dominate the phenomenon, there is significant FDI from 'independent' private businesses. Some of the business houses like the Birlas and Thapar are substantially transnational.||Sebastian Morris

While tentative moves towards reducing the deficit by tapping the black economy have been made, an increase in overall deficit seems likely and may lead to double-digit inflation. Given the magnitude and complexity of problems faced, it would be unrealistic to expect one budget to solve them. Yet some indications of long-term fiscal policy were expected.||D. T. Lakdawala

Because of the numbers involved and its complexities it also overwhelmed the capacity of the macrosystem, that is, the social and administrative structures to respond. An epidemiological perspective and method of study is vital to understanding the pattern and distribution of the adverse outcomes in the community and can provide a variety of data. The article, in two parts, uses an epidemiological perspective to appraise and review available literature concerning the health impact of the disaster and discusses methodological issues relevant to an epidemiological approach to the study of such a disaster.

30/6/1990- ||review of agriculture, june 1990||4396435||Fertiliser Use and Development of Institutional Infrastructure: A Preliminary Analysis||Future growth of fertiliser use in India depends much on the development of institutional infrastructure. Hence a shift in the focus of attention from the conventional 'demand'-oriented agro-economic variables to complementary agricultural institutions is essential for understanding the dynamics of fertiliser use. At the present level of fertiliser use, what is of importance is the strengthening of institutional facilities like extension, credit, distribution and marketing (for both inputs and output) such that farmers' potential demand for fertilisers can be made effective. However, in reality, many of these rural institutions are not well developed. Therefore, the extent to which farmers compromise with such bottlenecks depends on two factors-one, their resource position and two, the level of agricultural development of a given region. The former implies that the access to these rural institutions and the benefits accrued therefrom are not equal to all sections of the peasantry, and the latter indicates the importance of the regional factors in the development of such institutional infrastructure. This article argues that without a proper understanding of these processes and accompanying policy measures, the task of attaining optimum levels of fertiliser use would be formidable.||Sunitha Raju

This raises issues such as: how are these prices determined? What is their impact on open market prices? How do they affect the volume of procurement and output by entering into the incentive structure of farmers? This paper explores these issues in an empirical framework. The results indicate that procurement prices are largely influenced by movements in cost of production and lagged open market prices with occasional bonanzas emanating from non-economic considerations; procurement prices have a decisive influence on current market price formation with other factors like stocks with government and zoning playing only marginal roles; the volume of procurement is significantly affected by level of output and difference between procurement and open market prices weakly supported by administrative measures; the supply of wheat and rice is influenced by their open market prices, suitably deflated, and non-price variables like irrigation. The elasticity with respect to shifter variables is much greater than price elasticity. Results for wheat are more robust than for rice. In all cases state-level results reveal greater diversity. The study contemplates a supportive role for prices which becomes critical when non-price factors are in place.||Ashok Gulati,Pradeep K. Sharma

This evaluation of the organised development of animal husbandry in the state, which commenced during the First Five-Year Plan, reviews the factors facilitating the spread of crossbreeding. The paper examines trends such as the extent of utilisation of artificial insemination services, changes in the composition of cattle population, contribution of breed improvement to productivity of milch animals, demand for and returns from milk production and concludes with comments on the prospects for cattle development and milk production.||K.

In exploring these questions, this paper examines the resource potential of south Asia and the extent of its degradation and presents an outline of an approach to sustainable development through establishing a link between two levels of development praxis-grassroots organisation on the one hand and regional co-operation on the other.||Akmal Hussain

This paper makes an attempt in this direction. It examines past trends in the distribution and growth of consumption and assesses their relative impact on the poor and the ultra poor, over time and across states. The paper addresses the following questions: How has the distribution of per capita consumption changed over time across the states, and to what extent it has nullified the beneficial impact of growth on poverty? How have the poor and the ultra poor fared in the wake of changes in consumption and its distribution? What have been the regional patterns and to what extent can these patterns be explained by our knowledge of the characteristics and public interventions in operation in different regions/states? The authors consider the potential indirect role of agriculture and manufacturing, as well as the contribution of direct anti-poverty programmes that have been in operation for over a decade now and the trends in social sector expenditures and their outcomes.||N.

Extending this argument, the author suggests that the specific resolution of these tensions through the introduction of English education is enabled discursively by the colonial practice of translation. European translations of Indian texts prepared for a western audience provided to the 'educated' Indian a whole range of Orientalist images. Even when the anglicised Indian spoke a language other than English, he would have preferred, because of the symbolic power attached to English, to gain access to his own past through the translations and histories circulated through colonial discourse. English education also familiarised the Indian with ways of seeing, techniques of translation, or modes of representation that came to be accepted as 'natural'.||Tejaswini Niranjana

Such benefits however have considerable impact on the level of well-being of workers concerned and the differences in them cause further distortions in the distribution of income earnings. This paper draws attention to the wide range of such somewhat invisible, facilities enjoyed by a small group while the vast majority remain under-nourished and have to strive even for a bare existence. The authors also argue that there are wide differences even amongst those who are fortunate to have got into organisations that disburse such benefits.||Manabendu Chattopadhyay,Robin Mukherjee,Ashok Rudra

In the early 1980s, the overriding concern of the IMF was the threat to the stability of the international financial system arising from the exposure of hundreds of commercial banks, big and small, principally in Latin America, but also in eastern Europe and Africa. The new phenomenon of large-scale private bank lending to developing country governments, on floating interest rates, and short maturities, hailed as a creative initiative of the private sector in the 1970s, proved to be an all-round disaster, prolonging and deepening the adjustment of debtor countries to conditions of recession, falling commodity prices and rising interest rates. Adjustment replaced development, finance replaced sensible economics, exports replaced production for domestic use, and crisis management replaced economic and social planning. The human costs have been horrendous.||Kari Levitt

In many genres of representation however, women are not only visible: they are prominent objects of attention. The issue is then transformed into one of the correctness or incorrectness of the representation, or of the socially constraining nature of the stereotypical imagery, or of the relationship between women's subjectivity and objectivity. This paper looks at the representation of women in a little discussed genre of Indian popular art-what has been called 'calendar art' or 'bazaar art'. These representations are seen as instancing two processes, the commoditisation of women and the tropising of the feminine, within an overall cultural context that was both homogenising and hegemonising.||Patricia Uberoi

28/7/1990- ||special articles||4396562||Socialism at the End of the Century: Reflections on an Epoch Passed||The Russian Revolution of 1917 fashioned the contours of a new global epoch. The conclusive termination of this epoch by the events of 1989 and the transition to a new historical time have generated a crisis of Marxism. The project of renewal of Marxism and the identification of its sources demand a response in terms of a fundamental re-evaluation of the project undertaken in the name of socialism for the past seven decades. To this end the present essay makes an attempt to comprehend the crisis through an examination of the developments in the Soviet Union since 1917. Proceeding from an examination of the Bolshevik experience the study traces the defeat of the revolution and inauguration of Stalinism to the unreconciled disjunctions in the theory and practice of the Bolshevik paradigm. Positing a distinction between early Stalinism (1929-39) and late Stalinism (post-45) when the system moves into crisis the paper studies the consolidation of Stalinism through the collectivisation and industrialisation drives. The industrialisation of the 1930s is seen to have shaped the emergence of a social formation in the logic of which inhered waste, low productivity, absence of innovation and worker apathy and whose constitutive relations of production were mediated through tripartite links between workers, managers and the state. It is in these relations of production that the genetic origin of the extant crisis is located. Comments on the crisis of late Stalinism from Krushchev to Gorbachev are followed by discussion of the impact of the crisis on the Indian left. The essay concludes with observations on the prospects for socialism at this juncture. [The paper has been published in two parts. The first part appeared last week.]||Krishnendu Ray,Ravi Sundaram

Given the highly skewed distribution of land and assets and the marked regional concentration of irrigated areas, the policy package was bound to promote both inter- and intra-regional inequalities. One can thus perceive a built-in regressive element in the price policy and locate it within the overall policy of promoting growth through various production incentives, a policy not based on sufficient consideration of its distributional consequences.||N.

This is particularly true when the trading partners are not both centrally-planned economies. Further, these effects are likely to become even more pronounced as perestroika progresses in the Soviet Union.

In this spiritual economy, the liberalising and dissenting forms of bhakti emerge as a powerful force which selectively uses the metaphysic of high Hinduism in an attempt to create an inappropriable excess of transcendent value grounded in the dailiness of a material life within the reach of all. This paper attempts to understand the specific character of Mirabai's bhakti as it finds shape within the overlapping yet contradictory configuration of the patriarchal assumptions of the medieval Rajput state, prescriptive brahminical texts, and the female devotional voice as it develops in earlier and contemporary compositions of male bhaktas. What emerges is, firstly, that though the prescriptions of the smritis and Puranas do not survive as law, they are available as ideology which shapes the customary domain and self-description of Rajput ruling groups and constitute the historical moment in which Mira lives. Secondly, in the breaking and remaking of patriarchal relations, Mira's bhakti marks as well as belongs to a longer historical moment in which the prescriptions of the smritis and Puranas are selectively internalised, and the customary nexus of religious practice is translated into metaphors and emotional structures. Thirdly, though Mira's compositions are themselves ambivalently situated, there are significant differences in her personal practice and in her ideological location when compared to earlier and contemporary male bhaktas. And, finally, etched into Mira's enterprise is not only the difficulty of being 'original' in an oral tradition, but also the recalcitrance and the precariousness of personal rebellion.

But as the endogenous process of technology acquisition, absorption, diffusion and local adaptation gets going and as more and more people are productively employed, the rate of growth will pass that achieved under the inequalising spiral strategy and, besides, will be more sustainable in the long run.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

10/3/1990- ||special articles||4396020||Consumption Disparities, Food Surpluses and Effective Demand Failures: Reflections on Macroeconomics of Drought Vulnerability||Beginning with the issue of increasing vulnerability to drought in India, this paper attempts to inquire into the underlying reasons for this trend. The following crucial elements of an explanation are identified: (1) evidence of low consumption levels, (2) signs of an accentuation of inter-regional inequalities and particularly disparities in agricultural incomes, and (3) increases in the overall savings rate and changes in the composition of savings and asset holdings in rural areas. It is argued that the persistence of low consumption levels is both a cause and a consequence of the growing differentiation in the rural economy, and both these explain why-despite the fact that the system can mobilise an effective response to a weather-induced crisis like the drought-it cannot generate sufficient demand to mop up the large food surplus. It is in this sense that the demand constraint has become structurally embedded into the Indian economy. In this light, the rise in the savings rate is merely a reflection of growing disparities, and some of the savings may well have been brought about through a reduction in real consumption. This interlinked set of factors helps to explain why variations in weather cycles tend to cause larger swings in income and employment.||B. Gopalakrishna Kumar

They have also extended their limited spaces in dignified, creative encounters in ways that are qualitatively different from surrender, manipulation or destructive confrontation. One way has been to extend this space without rejecting or evacuating it but by exploring and working within it with unexpected richness. "Thumri" is the limited space of women in the world of Indian classical music which they have enriched in such a manner.||Vidya Rao
