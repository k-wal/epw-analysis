Consequent to growing concern about environmental health in the 1970s, public interest groups and unions began to recognise occupational hazards as a problem. Having little experience with hazards problems, unions requested outside help. The Bhopal accident forced wider attention on occupational hazards. These preliminary efforts have yet to impact shop-floor conditions, for, several impediments exist: inadequacy of the law, industry structure, labour attitudes, inadequate public interest lobby and union co-operation, resource constraints and so on.||S.

By implication, a desirable cropping pattern would be one which favours crops which are labour-intensive and have greater second-round employment effects. Simultaneously, it should favour crops which are either efficient import substitutes or exportables to save (earn) foreign exchange in balance. Further, given water as the binding constraint, the cropping pattern should attempt to maximise returns to this input and favour crops that are ecologically sustainable. This paper seeks to delineate broad contours of such a cropping pattern.||Ashok Gulati,Pradeep K. Sharma

This article looks at the geographical distribution of EGS employment in Maharashtra in order to examine to what extent the scheme has been responsive to the unmet employment needs reflected in the agro-ecological and other economic conditions affecting their employment opportunities relative to the growth of their labour force.||Hannan Ezekiel,Johann C.

This is more so in the relatively high-risk, low-productivity areas such as the arid and semi-arid tropical regions of India. Historically, (i) the presence of factors less favourable to rapid privatisation of land resources; (ii) community level concerns for collective sustenance and ecological fragility; and (iii) dependence of private resource based farming on the collective risk sharing arrangements, constituted circumstances favourable to the institution of common property resources in these areas. CPRs in turn contribute to the production and consumption needs of rural communities in several ways. However, notwithstanding their private contributions CPRs are faced with a serious crisis, as reflected by their area shrinkage, productivity decline, and management collapse. This article, based on field studies of CPRs in the dry tropical regions of India, presents micro-level evidence on contributions of CPRs, their present crisis, and future prospects.||N. S. Jodha

On the basis of an efficiency analysis of the different modes of transport the paper concludes that inland water transport has benefits to offer which are not being adequately exploited due to the decline that this particular mode has undergone on account of government neglect. The paper makes a plea for the revival of inland water transport and an increase in the share of rail traffic in order to remove the high burden on the road transport system.||K. P. Sunny

The government's own disaggregated data shows that 56 out of the 69 talukas of water starved Saurashtra, two-thirds of Gujarat's drought-prone or arid talukas and 42 out of the state's 47 tribal talukas and pockets are to get no water from the SSP.||Baba Amte
02/6/1990- ||special articles||4396355||Comparative Costs of Electricity Conservation: Centralised and Decentralised Electricity Generation||Energy planning, and the associated decision-making, requires choices between energy technologies. Thus far, these have been restricted to choices between supply options in particular, centralised energy technologies. But, this restriction to centralised sources is running into two major difficulties: (a) shortages of capital, and (b) popular opposition to the resulting local and global environmental degradation. Furthermore, what matters to a consumer of energy is not energy per se, but the services that energy provides. Hence, the true indicator of development is not the magnitude of energy used, but the level of energy services provided. It has, therefore, become essential to extend the list of options for energy decision-making so as to include both decentralised sources of supply, and energy efficiency improvements and other conservation options. This paper, therefore, attempts a comparative costing of electricity generating and saving technologies. The treatment covers the centralised technologies of nuclear power plants (CANDU type), coal-based thermal power plants, hydroelectric plants and natural-gas-based thermal power plants, the decentralised technologies of small hydroelectric plants, biogas-driven gensets, producer gas-driven gensets, diesel gensets and wind farms, and conservation technologies involving solar water heaters, improved irrigation pumpsets, replacement of standard motors with efficient motors, replacement of incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps, solar ponds, and cogeneration in sugar factories.||Amulya Kumar N.

This would be especially true of low rainfall, water scarce and drought prone states like Maharashtra, which may present a picture completely different from the all-India one. This study is an attempt at an inter-regional time series analysis of agricultural production in Maharashtra for the period 1956-57 through 1984-85. It specifically examines the growth rates in production, area and yield of foodgrains; the variability in production, area and yield of these crops; trends in instability in the production of foodgrains and other crops; relationship between growth and instability and the impact of irrigation on the variability in crop production.||Ashok K.

The long hours of work in the mills exhausted the workers both physically and mentally. The physical environment of their homes was no better; neglected by the authorities and exploited by private builders, the workers lived in ill-lighted, ill-ventilated dens in largely undeveloped, undrained areas. To find solace from this hard life of labour the workers often resorted to alcohol drinking. The regular intake of alcohol coupled with their hard work in the mills and the polluted atmosphere both at home and in the mills weakened their resistance and made them easy prey to various diseases. The lack of organised labour activity during the period under study was also attributable to the grim daily routine of the workers.||Shashi Bhushan Upadhyay

20/1/1990- ||special articles||4395844||Bombay Metropolitan Region: Some Issues in Spatial Development||Eventhough academic studies highlight the need for integrated development of metropolitan regions, they show a bias towards development of urban fringe, and rural peripheries have often been neglected. Such development measures are, however, in the form of palliatives rather than a final solution. It is necessary to lay special emphasis on the development of rural peripheries which are expected to provide ecological cushioning for the cities. This alone would bring in the necessary cohesion in metropolitan regional development. The present paper analyses the nature of evolution of the Bombay region and suggests some ways in which the integration could be brought about. The development of rural hinterland cannot be achieved by superimposing new activities on it but by making residents effectively participate in the existing city-oriented activities. Some institutional changes are suggested for the purpose.||V. S. Phadke

Yet, the reduction called for by the protocol, of 50 per cent of 1986 production levels by the year 2000, is seriously inadequate and a complete phase out is needed.||Arjun Makhijani,Amanda Bickel,Annie Makhijani
