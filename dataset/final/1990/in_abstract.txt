Given the kind of work environmentalists had done in Uttara Kanara, would this not have been more useful than a single token parliamentary candidate?||Kalpana Sharma

Consequent to growing concern about environmental health in the 1970s, public interest groups and unions began to recognise occupational hazards as a problem. Having little experience with hazards problems, unions requested outside help. The Bhopal accident forced wider attention on occupational hazards. These preliminary efforts have yet to impact shop-floor conditions, for, several impediments exist: inadequacy of the law, industry structure, labour attitudes, inadequate public interest lobby and union co-operation, resource constraints and so on.||S.

By implication, a desirable cropping pattern would be one which favours crops which are labour-intensive and have greater second-round employment effects. Simultaneously, it should favour crops which are either efficient import substitutes or exportables to save (earn) foreign exchange in balance. Further, given water as the binding constraint, the cropping pattern should attempt to maximise returns to this input and favour crops that are ecologically sustainable. This paper seeks to delineate broad contours of such a cropping pattern.||Ashok Gulati,Pradeep K. Sharma

This article looks at the geographical distribution of EGS employment in Maharashtra in order to examine to what extent the scheme has been responsive to the unmet employment needs reflected in the agro-ecological and other economic conditions affecting their employment opportunities relative to the growth of their labour force.||Hannan Ezekiel,Johann C.

This is more so in the relatively high-risk, low-productivity areas such as the arid and semi-arid tropical regions of India. Historically, (i) the presence of factors less favourable to rapid privatisation of land resources; (ii) community level concerns for collective sustenance and ecological fragility; and (iii) dependence of private resource based farming on the collective risk sharing arrangements, constituted circumstances favourable to the institution of common property resources in these areas. CPRs in turn contribute to the production and consumption needs of rural communities in several ways. However, notwithstanding their private contributions CPRs are faced with a serious crisis, as reflected by their area shrinkage, productivity decline, and management collapse. This article, based on field studies of CPRs in the dry tropical regions of India, presents micro-level evidence on contributions of CPRs, their present crisis, and future prospects.||N. S. Jodha

The Club of Rome has the distinction of spreading the awareness of doomsday with puissant reports linking environmental issues with population growth. This paper attempts to show the neo-Malthusianism inherent in some global perspectives on environment and the reflection of these perspectives on Indian policies and programmes.||K. R. Nayar

This is because the prevailing patterns of science, technology and growth are propelling humankind towards mass impoverishment and also creating a survival crisis.||Sailendra Nath Ghosh

There are also large gaps in the technical data forming the basis of the dam. It is ridiculous therefore to dismiss the opposition to the project as the work of "so-called environmentalists for completely putting a stop to development", as union minister Arif Mohammad Khan has sought to do.||Jayanta Bandyopadhyay
02/6/1990- ||special articles||4396355||Comparative Costs of Electricity Conservation: Centralised and Decentralised Electricity Generation||Energy planning, and the associated decision-making, requires choices between energy technologies. Thus far, these have been restricted to choices between supply options in particular, centralised energy technologies. But, this restriction to centralised sources is running into two major difficulties: (a) shortages of capital, and (b) popular opposition to the resulting local and global environmental degradation. Furthermore, what matters to a consumer of energy is not energy per se, but the services that energy provides. Hence, the true indicator of development is not the magnitude of energy used, but the level of energy services provided. It has, therefore, become essential to extend the list of options for energy decision-making so as to include both decentralised sources of supply, and energy efficiency improvements and other conservation options. This paper, therefore, attempts a comparative costing of electricity generating and saving technologies. The treatment covers the centralised technologies of nuclear power plants (CANDU type), coal-based thermal power plants, hydroelectric plants and natural-gas-based thermal power plants, the decentralised technologies of small hydroelectric plants, biogas-driven gensets, producer gas-driven gensets, diesel gensets and wind farms, and conservation technologies involving solar water heaters, improved irrigation pumpsets, replacement of standard motors with efficient motors, replacement of incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescent lamps, solar ponds, and cogeneration in sugar factories.||Amulya Kumar N.

20/1/1990- ||special articles||4395844||Bombay Metropolitan Region: Some Issues in Spatial Development||Eventhough academic studies highlight the need for integrated development of metropolitan regions, they show a bias towards development of urban fringe, and rural peripheries have often been neglected. Such development measures are, however, in the form of palliatives rather than a final solution. It is necessary to lay special emphasis on the development of rural peripheries which are expected to provide ecological cushioning for the cities. This alone would bring in the necessary cohesion in metropolitan regional development. The present paper analyses the nature of evolution of the Bombay region and suggests some ways in which the integration could be brought about. The development of rural hinterland cannot be achieved by superimposing new activities on it but by making residents effectively participate in the existing city-oriented activities. Some institutional changes are suggested for the purpose.||V. S. Phadke

Yet, the reduction called for by the protocol, of 50 per cent of 1986 production levels by the year 2000, is seriously inadequate and a complete phase out is needed.||Arjun Makhijani,Amanda Bickel,Annie Makhijani

This period should be used not only for a careful reappraisal of the projects but also to examine alternative methods of achieving the same development aims.||Bharat Dogra

This paper examines these three positions using cost-benefit methodology but including environmental and social implications and touches upon 'alternatives' to big dams.||Satyajit K. Singh
