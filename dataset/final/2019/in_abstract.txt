Analysing the recent deaths in Bengaluru’s sewage treatment plants and underground drainage systems, the understandings of manual scavenging as an “archaic” practice and opposed to the “rule of law” are rejected. The contractualisation of sewer maintenance instrumentalises “untouchable” bodies, making the calibration of caste power coincidental with the calibration of urban sewerage. Urban manual scavenging is shown to be an emergent application of caste power that resolves ecological impasses in contemporary sewerage. The objectification of caste power in urban infrastructures nevertheless opens up new locations for politicising normative caste embodiment.||Shreyas Sreenath
17-10-2019||insight||---------||Sukracharjya Rabha (1977–2018) : Empowering Community through Theatre in Assam||Sukracharjya Rabha, a visionary theatre practitioner, established the Badungduppa Kalakendra in a remote village at Rampur and was also the director of the well-known “Under the Sal Tree” annual theatre festival. His theatre practice that was rooted materially, economically and ecologically at the heart of an indigenous community, creates a distinctly different political economy, which departs radically from previous attempts by the exponents of the “Theatre of Roots” movement to indigenise theatre in India and formulates a critique of it.||Rajdeep Konar
27-09-2019||special articles||---------||Geographies of Drinking Water (In)securities in Peri-urban Hyderabad : A Political Ecology Perspective||​A political ecology framework has been employed to analyse patterns of drinking water (in)securities peculiar to peri-urban geographies. Primary field data have been used in the analysis. The many institutional arrangements that have emerged in peri-urban Hyderabad and how such arrangements have shaped the water ecology in the region and outcomes with respect to access to drinking water are described here. It argues that the water environment, both in terms of scarcity and pollution, and the social relations around water, co-produce each other, in sometimes unexpected ways. A primary finding is that the varying degrees and forms of private sector engagement in the drinking water sector produce different kinds of sub-geographies of distress in peri-urban spaces.||Sucharita Sen,Anshika John,Shreya Chakraborty,Manoj Jatav
13-09-2019||review of environment and development||---------||Towards a Conception of Socially Useful Nature||This article provides some theoretical and methodological reflections on the way in which the relationship between humans and nature has been captured in dominant forms of valuation of nature.It makes a critique of these methods and highlights the need to articulate a concept of “socially useful nature.” It uses this concept to interrogate dominant perspectives in the contemporary debates and methods on valuing nature from a Marxian perspective and shows the limitations of the tools and conceptual frameworks based on the principle of the commodification of nature in and for the market. In the context of this general theoretical framework, the article considers the methods promoted by the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting in valuation of nature and shows its inadequacy in arriving at a non-commoditised conception of “socially useful nature.”||Archana Prasad
13-09-2019||review of environment and development||---------||Many Environments : Rethinking Development and Environment in North Andaman||An ethnographic analysis of the interconnectedness of labour and landscape in North Andaman reveals a distinct discourse on the environment among the descendants of settlers there. They acknowledge that the labour of their ancestors created the landscape they inhabit. Yet, this entanglement of labour and nature seems irrelevant to their current understanding of the environment. This shift in discourse mirrors development and conservation expertise that imagines the environment of the Andaman Islands as devoid of labour. Unpacking the discursive, environmental and material circumstances in which the descendants of settlers produce their lives, allows us an insight into the widespread legitimacy accorded to the state to remake nature in the Andaman Islands today.||Anupama Ramakrishnan
13-09-2019||review of environment and development||---------||Eco-labour’s Challenge to the Neo-liberal Understanding of Nature : Conversations with Workers||A conversation is constructed around three themes that mediate the encounter between labour and nature. The first is external pollution and internal hazards, that workers know it is the same toxins affecting their workplace that are responsible for the impact on the environment. The second is collective labour and cumulative nature, that as workers collectivise at work to press their demands for justice, they become conscious of the cumulative impact of labour on ecosystems. The third is externalities and exertions, that the invisible costs of production immanent in waste streams are similar to the invisible appropriation of labour’s surplus. These three streams are brought together to show how labour’s alienation from nature is not rooted in the nature of labour, but is a construct of capitalism that can be overcome only when industrial society is challenged and transformed.||Dunu Roy

This requires an understanding of the politics of knowledge and examining knowledge claims made both for and against any particular innovation. Through the case of a specific agroecological innovation, the System of Rice Intensification in India, the barriers to a sustainable transition from a green revolution to an agroecological paradigm that reveals path dependence on certain agricultural futures—such as the New Plant Type or genetic transformation in rice—are highlighted.||C Shambu Prasad
19-07-2019||commentary||---------||Harvest of Uteruses||Forced to migrate to sugar belt for work, women face multiple reproductive health problems, due to the back-breaking work and poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, including menstrual hygiene. This situation along with an absence of public health facilities, allows a fertile and lucrative ground to the private healthcare facilities to provide unnecessary and extreme treatments even for minor gynaecological ailments, including the removal of their wombs. More than 4,605 hysterectomies are said to have been performed in the Beed district alone in the last three years.||Abhay Shukla,Seema Kulkarni
12-07-2019||special articles||---------||The Question of Organisation : Beyond Marx, the Enduring Legacy of Lenin||The “Organisation question” necessarily devolves into two others—Organisation for What? Organisation by Whom? This question is faced by those whose goal is to carry out, in perhaps the very long term, the project of dramatically reducing, even seeking to completely eliminate, various human relations of oppression and exploitation while establishing an ecologically stable balance between human society and nature. Then, how are we to go about this given that our current context is marked by a dynamic and interacting economic-political duality of a capitalist process of globalisation and a persistent multiple nation states system? Since the nation state is and will remain for the foreseeable future the most important political unit, progressive transformations in some major countries are necessary to kick-start and accelerate the desired transformation at the global level.||Achin Vanaik

Using a framework of indicators in the domains of pest management, fertiliser use, soil health, water conservation, biodiversity, and efficient use of inputs, statewise report cards on ecological sustainability of agriculture are provided. There is much variation in the sustainability of production practices across the country, with some states characterised by high use of pesticides, low soil organic content, depletion of groundwater levels, low crop diversity, high energy use, and widespread nitrate contamination of groundwater.||Divya Veluguri,Ramanjaneyulu G V,Lindsay Jaacks
07-06-2019||special articles||---------||The Politics of Farm Loan Waivers : A Comparative Study||Loan waiver policies are ostensibly political decisions, but surprisingly there have been no political analyses of the policy. The paper presents a political study on the policy through a descriptive analysis of a comprehensive primary data set that comprises all loan waiver announcements in India over the last three decades. The findings bring into light the political, economic and environmental factors that have had a bearing on the politicians’ choice to introduce waivers. Further, it highlights that politicians choose from a variety of waiver policy designs, and this choice has substantive implications for the size of the waiver programme.||Ajit Phadnis,Aishwarya Gupta
07-06-2019||special articles||---------||Doubling India’s Farm Incomes : Paying Farmers for Ecosystem Services, Not Just Crops||The Government of India aims to double farm incomes by 2022. A mechanism of payment for ecosystem services, which would compensate farmers for the value of the non-market agroecosystem services they produce, would address the issues of farm income and the deep ecological crisis in agriculture. This strategy would be within the fiscal ability of the government and would only use the existing allocation for agriculture. The institutional framework required to implement PES already exists. If properly implemented, PES could persuade Indian farmers to adopt ecologically sensitive agricultural practices which, in turn, could double farm income.||Lalit Kumar,M Manjula,Ramachandra Bhatta,L Venkatachalam,D Suresh Kumar,P Indira Devi,Pranab Mukhopadhyay

Refusal by the European and other advanced capitalist countries to acknowledge the root causes and own up to their responsibilities have blurred the line between life and death for migrants travelling through the Sahara to reach the Mediterranean.||Vijay Prashad

17-04-2019||special articles||---------||Neo-liberal Conservation : Analysing Carbon Forestry and Its Challenges in India||Carbon forestry projects such as REDD+, A/R CDM and the Green India Mission are based on the neo-liberal principles of privatisation, commoditisation, and marketisation. These market-oriented tools abstract forests from their sociocultural and ecological contexts and reduce their value for carbon forestry. These projects promote plantations of fast-growing species and undermine local knowledge and institutions. The available empirical evidence on the carbon forestry projects indicates that these have an impact on the rights and livelihoods of forest-dependent communities adversely. Hence, it is imperative to critically analyse them before scaling them up.||Ashish Aggarwal
04-04-2019||special articles||---------||Sustainability of Urban Water Supply and Sanitation in Dryland Areas : A Study of Indore City||The attainment of financial, environmental and social sustainability of urban service provision has become problematic nowadays. Within urban services, the supply of water and its disposal after use have become very important because water has to be brought from distant sources and the waste water needs to be treated before being discharged into natural waterbodies, both of which are very costly propositions. In dryland areas, which are physically water scarce and constitute some 70% of the country, the problem becomes even more acute. The water supply and sanitation services in the city of Indore in Madhya Pradesh are critically reviewed, and suggestions are made for alternative measures for a more equitable and sustainable water management system.||Rahul Banerjee

It has emerged as a multifaceted movement that has political, ethnic, and ecological overtones.||Anjana Singh
28-02-2019||commentary||---------||Mumbai’s Blinkered Vision of Development : Sacrificing Ecology for Infrastructure||Drawing on a discussion of five infrastructure projects in Mumbai, the lack of comprehensive focus in policy on environmental issues is highlighted. A project-wise focus and an unsustainable pattern of urbanisation have distanced the city development plans of Mumbai from achieving essential, interdependent goals of ecological health, environmental justice, and well-being.||Amrita Sen,Harini Nagendra

Even as these waterways open up for commercial shipping and navigation, and for interventions like dredging, river training, construction of terminals, and land acquisition, the legally binding regime of environmental clearance is evaded.||Shripad Dharmadhikary,Avli Verma
