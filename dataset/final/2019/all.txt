The failure of the mobilisations to project an alternative, the BJP’s hold among tea tribe communities, and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh activism at the grassroots are possible reasons that blunted the impact of the anti-CAB mobilisations. However, ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act could unsettle the calculations of theBJP in Assam.||Akhil Ranjan Dutta
27-12-2019||special articles||---------||Reservation Policy for Backward Classes : Extent and Determinants of Support||This paper examines the extent and determinants of popular support for reservation policy for the Scheduled Castes and the Other Backward Classes in India, using an individual-level opinion survey data set. It argues that the reservation policy, as well as its longitudinal extension and expansion into the private sector, is more supported than opposed, even though public opinion is polarised regarding its expansion to the private sector. Aside from the control variable of reservation status, those who are highly educated, female, rich, caste conscious, or have inter-caste friendships are likely to support reservation, whereas upper castes are less likely to support it.||Jungug Choi,Narender Kumar
27-12-2019||special articles||---------||Maharashtra Legislative Assembly Elections 2019 : Changing Social Equations||Despite the Bharatiya Janata Party’s conscious efforts to colour the state election campaign with national-level issues such as Article 370, or invoke the popular welfare schemes throughout the campaign in order to turn the beneficiaries into its loyal vote bank, it did not gain as much traction this time as it did in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The election results have shown that caste still continues to remain one of the significant factors at the level of local politics. The role of caste and shifting social bases of the political parties in this election can be analysed with specific focus on the consolidation of Maratha votes and shifts in the voting patterns of the Other Backward Classes.||Vivek Ghotale,Mukta Kulkarni

While Marx never devoted a specific work to a discussion of life after capitalism, in large part due to his aversion to indulging in utopian and speculative reflections about the future, his distinctive critique of the central realities of capitalism—such as the dual character of labour, socially necessary labour time, and the law of value and surplus value—intimates a form of future social relations that is far more liberatory than has generally been appreciated.||Peter Hudis

Emphasising this component of remittances that India has witnessed during the post-liberalisation period, the article investigates the demand-side macroeconomic effects of the flow of private transfers on key variables such as consumption, investment, imports, and income in India during the post-reform period of 1996–2014.||Isha Gupta

Building on the electoral management model proposed by Netina Tan, it suggests that a critical overview of ongoing efforts can help determine the readiness of Indian regulatory structures to respond to digital disruptions during elections and emphasises the need for a co-regulatory mechanism.||

Since 2001, however, there has been no attempt to examine the quality of the sample registration system.

The author analyses how Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were successfully able to employ the Chowkidar slogan on social media and integrate it with their offline campaign. The Chowkidar campaign and use of social media, the author argues, are a part of Modi’s populist playbook, noting the similarities the most recent campaign has with the BJP’s Chaiwala campaign in the 2014 general election.||

In this paper, we present our findings from an ongoing research study of primarily non-mainstream journalism, and the use of digital tools in the coverage of elections in 2019. Our main argument is that as the boundaries of professional journalism have withered, a culture of openness, rather than objectivity, has emerged as the defining aspect of political journalism. This shift towards being more transparent, and direct can enrich news-making, particularly in terms of dealing with misinformation, and responding to trolls who often act on behalf of party political agenda. However, as yet, few organisations seem prepared for training journalists in coping with the challenges of abuse and exclusions that are exacerbated during the election period.||

The Bharatiya Janata Party won all ten Lok Sabha seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha election, and with an electoral agenda in Haryana that was strongly influenced by national issues, the party was expected to return to power in the state with an even larger mandate.

Its association with educational attainments and urbanisation is testimony to the brighter side of the development story of India. Further, this rise, against the backdrop of the falling share of the informal sector employment, may suggest that the labour market participants can now afford to remain unemployed instead of getting residually absorbed in petty activities. However, this must not undermine the larger issue of employment creation, which has been a matter of great concern since long.||Arup Mitra,Jitender Singh

What goes into building the urban, both materially and perceptively is the accumulated capital, which in turn gets both (re)produced and consumed within the same set-up. The present circulation and accumulation of global capital has resulted in the creation of First World spaces within Third World cities, heterotopias which complicate claims to urban “city”zenships. The emergence of capital-infected cities and heterotopias is explored along with differential claims to urban “city”zenship using an interface with the Indian city as a context.||Apala Saha

Researchers and government officials in India have set up the Million Death Study to address this situation. First, how the study produces quantitative estimates of the burden of mortality in India is explored by collecting symptomatic data, using that data for diagnostic purposes, and aggregating those diagnoses into an overview of mortality in India. Second, the limitations of the perspective on public health based on discrete and specific diseases that result from this approach are addressed. Numbers alone cannot solve the public health issues India faces, rather cognitive justice towards a broader range of perspectives on major public health problems is required to develop effective political interventions.||Erik Aarden

Ethnographic accounts of union struggles highlight when trade unions resort to workplace-based activism for wages and when they prioritise agendas such as skill-enhancement, “development,” or workers’ welfare rights. What conjuncture of local contexts and circumstances enables one and which makes the other necessary? A discussion on three case studies shows how both “old” and “new” forms of collective organising co-constitute trade union activism involving women labouring in precarious livelihoods in the informal sector.||K Kalpana

The stickiness in price adjustment is evaluated in the context of the Indian economy by using the Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers data. The findings suggest that the monthly frequency of price changes is greater for the food group compared to the non-food group, and evidences are also found of exogenous versus menu cost-driven pricing behaviour in India.||Shesadri Banerjee,Rudrani Bhattacharya
13-12-2019||special articles||---------||School Choice in Rural India : Perceptions and Realities in Four States||Indian parents are faced with more choices of schools, but with less information on schools and schooling. The study across four states in rural India suggests that perceptions of teaching–learning, discipline, and safety of children in schools determine school choice among parents. Expenses are a critical consideration for parents who send children to public schools, while the English medium is important for parents of children going to private schools. However, parental choices of low-fee private schools are often not based on accurate information, and parents emphasise many educationally unimportant but aspirational factors. The marketing efforts of schools and cultural aspirations of parents reinforce each other, allowing for a situation in which actual educational outcomes can be subordinated, or worse, undermined.||Rahul Lahoti,Rahul Mukhopadhyay

Further, reducing agency costs does not necessarily remove the need for identity-based voting, and such voting behaviour is a means for engaging in the capture of public and private benefits by these groups.||Raghbendra Jha,Hari K Nagarajan,Anirudh Tagat

First, a hyphenated citizenship associated with the NRC, which made citizenship contingent on conditions of descent specific to each state, and second, a national citizenship associated with the CAB which has made religion a principle of distinguishability in the creation of bounded citizenship.

Interstate comparison reveals that lower levels of aggregate literacy for a state do not mean lower levels of literacy for all age cohorts. Group disparity in literacy is highest among the oldest age cohort and lowest for the youngest age cohort. With an appreciation of the concept of proximate literacy, the literacy pattern is verified in a household perspective.

A typical chowkidar is a middle-aged male with poor education and skills, working in urban areas on a low salary and without any written job contract or social security coverage. Instead of appropriating them as a metaphor for political gains, ensuring their job security should be a policy priority.||Sarthak Gaurav,Rayees Ahmad Sheikh

29-11-2019||review of urban affairs||---------||Becoming Waste : Three Moments in the Life of Landfills in Mumbai City||Colonial municipal planning discourses imagined waste as infrastructure to build Bombay city by filling creeks and reclaiming land. Waste as land was reassembled through the judiciary’s remaking of the landfill as a zone of pollution to be “scientifically” closed through waste treatment technologies. Even as science attempts to comprehend its complexity and contain it, waste possesses an agency of its own that disrupts the social, haunting reclaimed real estate with its fugitive gaseous presence.||Shireen Mirza
29-11-2019||review of urban affairs||---------||Urban Waste and the Human–Animal Interface in Delhi||It is well-documented that urban waste contributes to the economy by creating livelihoods. Less is known, however, about the role of urban waste in producing human–animal ecologies involving livestock and wild birds. Here, four aspects of human–animal relationships in two urban subsystems involving waste as raw material for both stall-fed livestock (focusing on cows) and foragers (focusing on kites) are discussed. These are the roles of waste as feed; complex spatial relationships between animals, humans and their wastes; high densities of animals and humans leading to conflict over waste; and emerging threats of diseases spilling across social and physical barriers between animals and humans mediated by waste, with implications for the health of urbanised living beings.||Nishant Kumar,Aparajita Singh,Barbara Harriss-White
29-11-2019||review of urban affairs||---------||From Balmikis to Bengalis : The ‘Casteification’ of Muslims in Delhi’s Informal Garbage Economy||The reorganisation of informal household garbage collection work in Delhi is analysed, as migrants from eastern states like West Bengal have begun doing manual waste work, even as their Balmikis deal only with monthly cash payments. Drawing on fieldwork, the effect on the Balmiki jamadars is noted, and the Bengali Muslims, who newly contend with the practices of untouchability in their neighbourhoods of work, are focused on. These newer migrants come to justify the shame they experience by focusing on the equivalence of scrap with money, which has redemptive potential. This reveals a dynamic process through which caste differences are being remade—”casteification”—in relation to economic life.||Dana Kornberg
29-11-2019||review of urban affairs||---------||Numbing Machines : Manual Scavenging’s Reconstitution in 21st-century Bengaluru||What forms does manual scavenging take after its legal abolition? Analysing the recent deaths in Bengaluru’s sewage treatment plants and underground drainage systems, the understandings of manual scavenging as an “archaic” practice and opposed to the “rule of law” are rejected. The contractualisation of sewer maintenance instrumentalises “untouchable” bodies, making the calibration of caste power coincidental with the calibration of urban sewerage. Urban manual scavenging is shown to be an emergent application of caste power that resolves ecological impasses in contemporary sewerage. The objectification of caste power in urban infrastructures nevertheless opens up new locations for politicising normative caste embodiment.||Shreyas Sreenath
29-11-2019||review of urban affairs||---------||Neo-liberalising Inclusion? : Waste Picking, Data Activism, and the State||Non-governmental organisations and civil society actors have mobilised in several Indian cities around issues facing informal waste pickers. Data (surveys, narratives, visualisations) is a key basis on which ngos premise such negotiations with the state. How a data-based ngo–state collaboration can provide the state new modalities of intervention and control over informal labour and its unaccounted value chains is discussed. However, the state’s response, as observed in Chennai, had been fractured and idiosyncratic. Given this, it is also shown how this selective “hearing” by the state is articulated with certain dynamics of data and ngo activism to facilitate the roll-out and rollback processes of neo-liberalisation in Chennai.||Harsha Anantharaman
29-11-2019||review of urban affairs||---------||The Colonial Roots of India’s Air Pollution Crisis||Tracing the genealogy of the scientific claim that Indian lung capacity is deficient vis-à-vis the “European norm,” it is argued that the pathologisation of the Indian lung that once justified colonial-era segregation has made a troubling contemporary return, producing state imperceptibility of pollution-induced illness. Specifically, colonial theories of tropical air suggest that the Indian lung is uniquely suited to a dusty environment. When invoked in the present, this obviates the need for urgent pollution abatement action.||D Asher Ghertner

The analysis is based on the 60th and 71st rounds of the National Sample Survey for 2004 and 2014. Even though comparisons of prevalence and shares between men and women are relied on in the analysis, some glaring disparities emerge. The growing menace of NCDs in the context of a rapidly increasing older population calls for bold policy initiatives, which are currently either underfunded or limited in coverage and uncoordinated. A drastic overhaul of the health system and behavioural changes are thus emphasised.||Pratima Yadav,Veena S Kulkarni,Vani S Kulkarni,Raghav Gaiha

A significant rise in mean temperature is observed in both the rice- and wheat-growing periods. Rainfall during the rice-growing period has decreased 7% annually over the past 30 years. Significant climate change will lower the rice yield by 8.10% by 2080 and wheat by 6.51%. To mitigate the effects of climate change, it is necessary to adopt climate-resilient crop choices and irrigation practices and technologies.||Sunny Kumar,Baljinder Kaur Sidana

While the decreasing trend is undisputed in Western nations, the perception in India is that the crime data has been manipulated by the police. The examination of constituent units composed of a diverse selection of districts in India suggests that the trends are generally similar across the country and are not an outcome of deliberate police practices. Police practices do not present any evidence of geographical bias in the registration of crime.||Arvind Verma,Hanif Qureshi,Michael Frisby,Alok Mohan

Using a comprehensive database on start-ups retrieved from Tracxn, a business data and analytics company, the authors find that venture capital concentrates amongst graduates stemming from a handful of prestigious education institutes in India and abroad. The article analyses the role of entrepreneurship policies and argues for a shift of focus and resources towards the building of a more inclusive start-up ecosystem.||Yves-Marie Rault,Shawn Mathew

India has three FTAs with the members of Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Korea and Japan, which were expected to increase India’s exports. Exports did not increase as Indian enterprises lack competitiveness, but imports from the partner countries expanded, leading to the haemorrhaging of domestic manufacturing. Future participation in FTAs must be conditioned on improving the competitiveness of domestic entities.||Biswajit Dhar

A closer look at the data for the period 2011–12 and 2017–18 shows that it is the net result of a dynamic process of job creation and destruction. Those who have lost jobs are all with low education, that is, less than secondary level of education. From a gender perspective, rural women workers are the net losers. From a social point of view, the net losers belong to two groups: Muslims and Hindu Other Backward Classes. These are clear signs of rural India in distress with strong gender and social dimensions.||K P Kannan,G Raveendran

We find that despite a reduction in bollworm infestations, secondary pest pressure is high. Farmers use pesticides indiscriminately and there is widespread practice of using “pesticide cocktails.” Farmers also mix pesticides with fertilisers. The use of weedicides and “tonics” is also widely prevalent. Farmers who perceive pesticides as yield-enhancing input spent more per acre on them. These findings raise concerns about the role of agricultural input dealers in filling up the agricultural information void for pest management.||Thiagu Ranganathan,Sarthak Gaurav

Though he wanted a common language for the country, but that language was Hindustani written in Devanagari and Persian script. The present-day Hindi, however, is markedly different from Hindustani, the admixture of Hindi and Urdu, which Gandhi had advocated.||

However, in 1954, the Delimitation Commission of India clubbed the electorates of the erstwhile Thoubal subdivision (excluding Bishenpur tehsil) with the Outer Manipur constituency to "balance" the number of voters in the two constituencies, thereby increasing the number of non-tribal voters in Outer Manipur. This arrangement denies non-tribal people the right to contest elections and makes ST candidates dependent on non-tribal votes for electoral success.||

However, there is an upward surge in the technology protection, incubation and other commercialisation activities in recent times. This can be attributed to the recent transformation of the agribusiness ecosystem in the country due to policy initiatives and more focused research in applied and frontier areas.||Manoj P Samuel,Karim Maredia,R Kalpana Sastry

Rather than combing through the entirety of the work in question, it is essential to capture the sense of vision that constitutes a part of the challenge of Practicing Caste.||Sasheej Hegde,Sanjay Palshikar
25-10-2019||special articles||---------||Are You Talking about ‘Jungle Patta’? : FRA Implementation in West Bengal||The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 attempts to empower forest-dwellers for their own governance. This article examines the validity of conservationists’ apprehension of “land loot” after 10 years of implementation of the act. It shows, with empirical evidence from West Bengal, that actual land recognition is far less compared to what has been stated in the act. In effect, recording of land rights became a contraction of legal access to existing forest resources, which might lead to conflicts in future. The state used this act for political benefits, reducing it to a mere “beneficiary scheme” of panchayat-level governance, with the whole implementation becoming a patta-giving exercise to forest-dwellers.||Bidhan Kanti Das

Just how viable, however, are individual and household efforts for addressing the water challenges on the horizon? Drawing from a selection of documents and interviews, it contends that several disincentives deter people from acting on the clarion call of household-level rainwater harvesting. The observations shift the onus of responsibility back onto the centralised water system and the municipal agencies charged with water management.||Georgina Drew
25-10-2019||special articles||---------||Subaltern Historiography, the Working Class, and Social Theory for the Global South||The Indian Freedom Movement (1857–1947) was a significant period which had a politically important impact on the Indian state’s subsequent formation. The historiography of the movement was until recently much more monochromatic than the movement itself, highlighting the contributions of “great men.” The Subaltern Studies Collective (1980s–present) rejected this approach, taking a broader and more productive approach to telling the story of the movement via the bottom-up contributions to Indian history. Surprisingly, however, what became known as Subaltern Studies has downplayed the empirical role of the working class. One reason for this underemphasis is a specific and culturally essentialist mode of appropriating the work of E P Thompson, Carlo Ginzburg, and Hayden White, who are declared influences on Subaltern Studies. Why that was so remains an important question.||Kristin Plys

17-10-2019||special articles||---------||What Is the Effective Delivery Mechanism of Food Support in India? : A Demand-side Assessment of Alternative Apparatus||The public distribution system is the cornerstone of anti-poverty initiatives in India to address the issue of hunger and malnutrition, but is plagued with leakages and corruption. Though several possible reasons account for these problems, one factor that is generally overlooked is the lack of assessment of the preference of the beneficiaries in terms of product portfolio, selection, and delivery mechanisms. Through a mixed methods analysis across Bihar, Odisha and (eastern) Uttar Pradesh, this paper assesses the factors explaining the diversity in the preference for the delivery mechanism. What would be a straightforward choice problem among delivery mechanisms turns out to be far more intricate when mediated by contextual heterogeneity and unequal power relations at different levels. The results highlight the centrality of demand and build a case for demand assessment in improving the effectiveness of the system.||Mamata Pradhan,Devesh Roy,Vinay Sonkar
18-10-2019||special articles||---------||Medical Negligence and Law : Application of the Bolam and Bolitho Rules in India||India has adopted the Bolam rule from the United Kingdom and has been using it to adjudicate cases of medical negligence. The evolution of the Bolam rule in the UK as well as the way the rule is applied in India by the Supreme Court reflects a balance between judicial intervention and deference to medical expertise. Although it is settled that it is the courts and not medical experts who must finally decide on whether the conduct of a doctor is negligent, the standards to be used when evaluating expert evidence and the extent to which such cases must be deferred to are evolving. The Supreme Court has not clearly stated the judicial standard against which it will test these differing opinions of medical experts and has not been consistent in its willingness to do so. Therefore, the application of the Bolam rule in India has been inconsistent and this is likely to have an impact on the decisions made by medical practitioners.||M P Ram Mohan,Vishakha Raj

As a result, the Indian state has relied on a non-preference, non-discrimination framework to address the issues of backwardness and under-representation of Muslims. This article attempts to partially reconcile the contradiction between religion-based preferential treatment and secularism, and it is argued that the determination of welfare policies for religious minorities, particularly Muslims within the non-preference, non-determination framework, either has to be justified in the public philosophy of the state or social justice has to be given a relative preference to secularism, especially when the policies formulated within the non-preference, non-discrimination framework have not proven to be effective in targeting the relative backwardness of Muslims.||Zubair Ahmad Bader

Falling levels of capacity utilisation, building up of food stocks and the state of liquidity in the economy sufficiently prove that the problem today is the lack of demand. Rural distress, rising inequality and falling real wages are driving down demand. The government’s response to the slowdown has been woefully inadequate. The biggest impediment to policymaking is not the lack of ideas, but the blinkered vision of economics.||Ishan Anand,Rohit Azad

A recent study of slums in Angul and Dhenkanal—two small towns in Odisha—shows that culture does not operate in isolation. It is determined by multiple factors such as the availability of physical space in urban areas, the resources to be invested, essential infrastructure such as water, and accessible, cost-effective technology. There are aspects of culture that people compromise on, but certain cultural norms are non-negotiable. This calls for a decoding of the cultural determinants of sanitation.||Ranjita Mohanty,Anju Dwivedi

Looking at the political discourse of cultural–religious assertions in the lives of the Balmikis, it is evident that after 1917, the Indian National Congress lured the untouchable communities to remain as bystanders for its political objectives. As a result, the Arya Samaj, the Hindu Mahasabha, and the All India Anti-Untouchability League (later known as the Harijan Sevak Sangh) began to redefine Hindu religious traditions through the process of cultural–religious assertions among the “Chuhra Balmikis.”||Rajiv Atwal

If implemented as such, the comprehensive approach of the National ECCE Policy 2013, where care, nutrition, health, and early learning are seen as inseparable elements assuring the holistic development of a child will give way to a split-system where early education is prioritised at the cost of all other components, raising fears of “schoolification” of early childhood years.||Neenu Suresh

The Maoist movement’s communitarian approach to rights, where every fight for justice is reduced to “us versus them,” comes at a high cost to overall justice in society. Instead, the only reasonable approach is one that recognises multiple credible claims to justice from myriad interests of individuals and groups across society.||Tanay Balantrapu

Migrant communities’ precarious experiences of the city significantly shape the educational experiences of children. The out-of-school construct has to be understood in a nuanced and layered manner in order to envisage meaningful educational initiatives for migrant children.||Vijitha Rajan

03-10-2019||special articles||---------||Reconciliations of Caste and Medical Power in Rural Public Health Services||Drawing from an ethnographic study conducted in a Karnataka village, the unfavourable differential treatments against Dalit patients in rural public health services are delineated. An analysis of medical interactions shows that as compared to non-Dalits, Dalit patients experienced more apathy, denial, and avoidance behaviours from service providers. Surprisingly, most Dalits did not attribute this to their caste, but to the flaws of the public health delivery system. Caste and allopathic medical practice are embedded in the rural public health delivery system, and both camouflage and normalise discrimination in paternalistic medical interactions. This sustains the favourable environment for caste-based discrimination in rural public health services even in places where Dalit consciousness is strong.||Sobin George

The differential effects of the covariates on wage gap at different locations of the wage distribution are estimated by applying the quantile regression model. After estimating the differential effects, the relevance of the glass ceiling or sticky floor hypothesis has been tested with Indian data. The wage gap between temporary and permanent employment is decomposed into the endowment effect based on the difference in labour market characteristics and coefficient effect based on the difference in returns for the same characteristics.||Panchanan Das

Primary field data have been used in the analysis. The many institutional arrangements that have emerged in peri-urban Hyderabad and how such arrangements have shaped the water ecology in the region and outcomes with respect to access to drinking water are described here. It argues that the water environment, both in terms of scarcity and pollution, and the social relations around water, co-produce each other, in sometimes unexpected ways. A primary finding is that the varying degrees and forms of private sector engagement in the drinking water sector produce different kinds of sub-geographies of distress in peri-urban spaces.||Sucharita Sen,Anshika John,Shreya Chakraborty,Manoj Jatav

Treating human, municipal and industrial waste released into the Ganga is a long-term project requiring vast resources and political energy, besides behavioural change on a mass scale. But, Ganga’s dry season flows can be quickly improved by basin-scale conjunctive management of the surface water and groundwater. Irrigation in the Ganga basin today depends on tubewells far more than canals. A multipronged protocol is outlined to manage the old canal network and new hydropower storages in order to maximise irrigation benefits and improve dry season river flows.||Tushaar Shah,Abhishek Rajan

Growth will decelerate further without a programme of deep fiscal adjustment. How a fiscal space, amounting to over 6% of the gross domestic product, can be freed through such an adjustment programme is demonstrated. This space can be potentially used for an inclusive public expenditure-led strategy for reviving growth.||Sudipto Mundle,Satadru Sikdar

No other region illustrates this better than the North East. This complex topic is examined with reference to the “tribal metropolis” of Shillong in Meghalaya, which is experiencing a rapidly changing urban landscape. How urban space is governed in Shillong is analysed. In doing so, contestations by various stakeholders regarding urban expansion and development along with its implications for the tribal population living in the vicinity of the city are examined.||Aashish Khakha

The measures of general standard of living and mainstreaming of the marginalised are quantified using the National Sample Survey cross-sectional estimates of household private consumption for Uttarakhand, juxtaposed with those for its parent state of Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and the national context of India for 2004–05 and 2011–12. Uttarakhand seems to have done well in realising the goals in the national context, but it has a long way to go in mainstreaming the marginalised social groups in both rural and urban sectors within the state.||M H Suryanarayana,Rajendra P Mamgain

The most significant aspect of this crisis is the efforts to make manufactured water (h2o) available for human beings, leaving behind contaminated poisonous water for all non-human living beings. To tide over this crisis, it will be necessary to recognise that only the hydration of non-human living beings will ensure water availability for human beings. The primordiality of water in landscapes (and not h2o) will have to be given a foundational position in the modern world view, as the reflexive labor it metabolises can restrain the instrumental labour metabolised by h2o.||

In the context of this general theoretical framework, the article considers the methods promoted by the United Nations System of Environmental-Economic Accounting in valuation of nature and shows its inadequacy in arriving at a non-commoditised conception of “socially useful nature.”||Archana Prasad
13-09-2019||review of environment and development||---------||Many Environments : Rethinking Development and Environment in North Andaman||An ethnographic analysis of the interconnectedness of labour and landscape in North Andaman reveals a distinct discourse on the environment among the descendants of settlers there. They acknowledge that the labour of their ancestors created the landscape they inhabit. Yet, this entanglement of labour and nature seems irrelevant to their current understanding of the environment. This shift in discourse mirrors development and conservation expertise that imagines the environment of the Andaman Islands as devoid of labour. Unpacking the discursive, environmental and material circumstances in which the descendants of settlers produce their lives, allows us an insight into the widespread legitimacy accorded to the state to remake nature in the Andaman Islands today.||Anupama Ramakrishnan

Field sciences such as fisheries science offer an opportunity to examine how workers engage with the field to produce value. Tracing historical influences that contribute to dissimilar identities and experiences with the field among scientific workers in India today reveals how value in routinised forms of field-based scientific labour is better understood through embodied skills and cultural relations forged by fieldworkers.||Aarthi Sridhar
13-09-2019||review of environment and development||---------||Eco-labour’s Challenge to the Neo-liberal Understanding of Nature : Conversations with Workers||A conversation is constructed around three themes that mediate the encounter between labour and nature. The first is external pollution and internal hazards, that workers know it is the same toxins affecting their workplace that are responsible for the impact on the environment. The second is collective labour and cumulative nature, that as workers collectivise at work to press their demands for justice, they become conscious of the cumulative impact of labour on ecosystems. The third is externalities and exertions, that the invisible costs of production immanent in waste streams are similar to the invisible appropriation of labour’s surplus. These three streams are brought together to show how labour’s alienation from nature is not rooted in the nature of labour, but is a construct of capitalism that can be overcome only when industrial society is challenged and transformed.||Dunu Roy

But, in India, the economic dependence of states on the centre is rather high because of widespread disparities in their levels of economic development. The federal transfers to the states through the Finance Commission, Planning Commission and centrally-sponsored schemes are investigated. The role of the union government in equitable direct investment, subsidy, and private investment policy for unbiased regional development is also underlined . The data proves that although the Finance Commission’s transfers are progressive, the share of devolution for low-income states is gradually decreasing. Unfortunately, all other transfers and efforts by the centre are regressive to address the regional inequality issues.||Bakshi Amit Kumar Sinha,Barna Ganguli

Four hospital efficiency indicators based on annual hospital statistical reports from 2005–06 to 2015–16 were studied and compared with the respective figures of other countries.

The party’s success in neutralising opposition to the controversial bill amongst non-Muslims and diverting attention towards the increase in the percentage of Muslim population, marked a continuation of the trend witnessed in the 2016 assembly elections, when it managed to patch up a “rainbow coalition” with regionalist groups raising the issue of protection of land and identity from “illegal Bangladeshi Muslim migrants.”||Dhruba Pratim Sharma,Vikas Tripathi

This article argues that this vision of the future is based on a selective understanding of India’s agrarian past as backward and needing redemption. There is inadequate evidence to support the claim that India was food-insecure in the 1960s. Moreover, evidence suggests that India’s food and nutritional insecurities today are the aftermath of the green revolution strategy promoted since the 1960s. This article is a small contribution towards comprehensively outlining that past so that we can begin to imagine a new vision for India’s agrarian future.||Richa Kumar

Though controversial, the advanced biological control approach has re-emerged as a strong alternative in the last decade and is shaping the trajectory of technological change in the fight against mosquitoes and associated vector-borne diseases. Since these efforts might change the way India manages its huge infectious disease burden in the long term, it is important to understand how certain technoscientific visions and ideas persist even while being controversial.

16-08-2019||commentary||---------||NDA’s Big Victory in Bihar||The National Democratic Alliance registered its best ever performance in Bihar in the Lok Sabha elections 2019. Not only did it win all but one seat, but it won mostly with huge margins. Two reasons stand out for the performance of the NDA: its reconstitution to include Janata Dal (United) and the high level of trust in the leadership of Narendra Modi. With assembly elections in the next year, it remains to be seen if and how the opposition alliance will be able to recuperate from its defeat.||Mohammad Sanjeer Alam,Rakesh Ranjan
16-08-2019||commentary||---------||The Enigma of the 2019 Parliamentary Elections in Telangana||The first Lok Sabha election results after the formal creation of Telangana and its wider implications for both state and national politics are assessed. Coming as it did, within a few months of the state assembly polls, the electorate in the state made a clear distinction between the earlier state election verdict and the present verdict in the national election. What factors contributed to this change and what are the implications for the politics in the state?||H Vageeshan,Ramya Chitrapu
16-08-2019||commentary||---------||Election Results in Odisha : Welfarism versus Hindutva||The 2019 elections in Odisha present a unique case where Narendra Modi becomes the most acceptable face as Prime Minister, but the Biju Janata Dal gets an upper hand in vote shares and seats. While the Bharatiya Janata Party has substantially gained in terms of vote share, the BJD has retained its popularity. The decline of Congress and the emergence of a women-centric political discourse in Odisha must be seen in this context.||Hilal Ahmed,Gyanranjan Swain
16-08-2019||commentary||---------||A Big Pay-off for BJP’s Aggressive Campaign in Jharkhand||The success of the Bharatiya Janata Party in Jharkhand in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections was enabled by the popularity of Narendra Modi as the prime ministerial candidate, people’s perception of the BJP being the saviour of the nation, and a sense of satisfaction with the performance of its government at the centre. However, most of these factors will not be able to mobilise the voters in favour of the party in the forthcoming assembly elections.||Harishwar Dayal
16-08-2019||commentary||---------||An Outlier in the North : Success of the Congress in Punjab||The most significant development of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Punjab was the victory of the Congress, making the state an outlier in almost all of India, except for Kerala. Neither the Bharatiya Janata Party’s narrative of national security nor its strong leader could find much traction in the state. The significant loss of the core social constituency’s (read the Sikhs) support of the Shiromani Akali Dal and the decline or almost decimation of the Aam Aadmi Party were important developments of this election.||Jagrup Singh Sekhon,Ashutosh Kumar
16-08-2019||budget 2019-20||---------||Road Map for Structural Reforms in Budget 2019 : A Reality Check||There were great expectations of fast-tracking reforms in the budget. However, it disappoints in setting a road map for creating a virtuous cycle of investment and growth. On the fiscal front, the overambitious revenue projections raise questions of credibility and feasibility of containing the deficits at the budgeted level. The wait for banking and financial sector reforms continues. The selective increases in import duties are retrograde, and increase in the taxes on the super-rich complicates the tax system without much gain in revenues. The centralisation through the levy of surcharges does not match the lip service given to cooperative federalism.||M Govinda Rao
16-08-2019||budget 2019-20||---------||Betting on Animal Spirits : Budget 2019 in a Neo-liberal Bind||Budget 2019–20 is more concerned with getting private finance for investment, especially in infrastructure, rather than with finding ways to finance much needed state action to address slowing growth and welfare shortfalls. However, even that stance does not free it from the neo-liberal fiscal bind it finds itself in.||C P Chandrasekhar
16-08-2019||budget 2019-20||---------||Much Ado About Nothing : Financial Sector in the 2019 Union Budget||The announcements for the financial sector in the 2019–20 budget are either too little or too grandiose relative to the actual requirements of the sector. Given this, the author questions the razzmatazz about the budget as the “auspicious” occasion for which government policy initiatives need to wait to be announced.||Partha Ray
16-08-2019||budget 2019-20||---------||Putting the Cart before the Horse : Agri-food in the Union Budget 2019–20||The 2019 union budget has neither proposed any bold policy moves, nor any big allocations for investments in the agri-food sector. What it has is massive welfare programmes, predominantly the remnants of its predecessor government’s welfare policies. It appears that India has already become a welfare state before generating enough wealth. Has the budget for the agricultural sector actually put the cart before the horse?||Ashok Gulati
16-08-2019||budget 2019-20||---------||Growth, Employment and Labour through a Budget Lens||Despite the rhetoric in the budget speech of the finance minister, the larger picture emerging from the recent data is a slowdown in growth and a net decline in employment. Not only is this a case of jobless growth, but also one of job-displacing growth. Men have gained and women have lost. The rural economy has suffered the most. In the meantime, there is a process of downgrading the rights of labour. There is very little to cheer about the economy.||K P Kannan
16-08-2019||budget 2019-20||---------||Social Sector in the 2019 Union Budget||The 2019 Union Budget has touched on all the components of the social sector in bits and pieces. However, the overall framework for the sector is not clear. Though a key initiative of the current government has been the increase in direct benefit transfers for welfare schemes, there is a need for increasing the state capacity, particularly of the poorer states, as the major social sector expenditures, mainly on health and education, are done by the states.||S Mahendra Dev
16-08-2019||budget 2019-20||---------||Vision for Industrial Growth in Budget 2019–20||The budget articulates a vision for the growth of the manufacturing sector which is built on three pillars: (i) increase in investments, private investments in particular, (ii) enabling of conditions for small firms to grow and move into the next strata, and (iii) enhancement of the rate of growth of exports. However, as it turns out the vision has been clouded by some illusions. The challenge of growth acceleration of the industrial sector is confounded by the fact that factor augmentation is at a slow pace despite an increase.||M Suresh Babu
16-08-2019||special articles||---------||Census Towns in Uttar Pradesh : Understanding the Transformation of Rural Economy into Urban Economy||An understanding of the emergence of new census towns, as reported by the 2011 Census, necessitates an investigation, specifically at a micro level, into the factors behind the shift of the male working population from the farm sector to the non-farm sector. The emergence of census towns at an all-India level and the history of census towns in Uttar Pradesh are examined. Census towns in selected districts of UP have been analysed to comprehend the trends and patterns of urbanisation resulting from the transformation of rural areas into urban settlements. A case study of Soraon, a census town in Allahabad district of UP, has also been undertaken to further understand the urbanisation process along the rural–urban continuum.||Prem Kumar
14-08-2019||perspectives||---------||Can India Raise Its GDP Per Capita to $5,000 by 2030?||The ebbs and floods of investment and growth in the Indian economy in the past two decades are rooted in the movements in steel prices. Short-cuts used in the compilation of macro statistics obscure the policy debate by creating incongruous images: real investment growth is rising, but the rate of investment is sliding; doing business is easier, but business activity is growing slower. If policies are pursued to facilitate business activity, and better methods are used to measure it, India can raise its gross domestic product per capita to $5,000 by 2030 (from $1,965 in 2017).||Jayanta Kumar Mallik

09-08-2019||h t parekh finance column||---------||A Rate Cut That Failed to Please||The decision of the United States Federal Reserve to cut short its cycle of interest rate increases and reduce rates, while announcing a halt to its quantitative tightening programme, is likely to restore an environment of excess and cheap liquidity. While justified as a means to strengthen the US recovery, this move would in all probability deliver increased financial speculation rather than higher growth. If that triggers another financial boom–bust cycle, slow growth could be followed by another deep recession.||C P Chandrasekhar
09-08-2019||alternative standpoint||---------||A Blinkered View of Humanities Education?||The draft National Education Policy, 2019 (DNEP) is an important document. It has had a fair share of criticism but that is to be expected given the diversity of opinions about education in our country. It is a sincere attempt to present a vision for the future of education in India. It is holistic in that it combines the vision of education from school to higher education within one document. It thus attempts a kind of unification of the aims and practices of education. Most importantly, as part of this vision, it strongly promotes a basic foundation of multidisciplinarity and liberal arts education at all levels. To say this in explicit terms and to say it with enough detail to make it seem as if it is workable is indeed commendable.||Sundar Sarukkai

09-08-2019||commentary||---------||What Swayed the Delhi Voters towards BJP?||In a triangular contest in Delhi, the Bharatiya Janata Party won all the seven Lok Sabha seats. The National Election Study 2019 of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies–Lokniti points towards three reasons for the BJP’s victory. The first is the increasing gravitation of Delhi voters towards the BJP in Lok Sabha polls. The second is the satisfaction of voters with BJP’s governance at the centre. The final factor is that the BJP gained votes among all segments of society.||Biswajit Mohanty

09-08-2019||commentary||---------||Elections in Andhra Pradesh : Voter Preference for YSRCP||The Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party, by defeating regional and national parties in the 2019 parliamentary and assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh, has secured a massive mandate. Its victory in this multiparty contest can be attributed to the padayatra, consistency in the stand for special category status, promise to implement welfare schemes, and its effective campaign.||E Venkatesu
09-08-2019||commentary||---------||BJP’s Sweeping Electoral Victory in Haryana||The Bharatiya Janata Party’s sweeping victory in Haryana in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections has highlighted the changing nature of politics in the state. The BJP overshadowed the regional parties which used to be its coalition partners in past elections. Dynastic politics which was one of the main features of Haryana politics was rendered ineffective as the BJP was accepted across various socio-demographic indicators.||Kushal Pal,Jyoti Mishra
09-08-2019||commentary||---------||BJP Replaces the Congress in Maharashtra||Long known for its Congress system, Maharashtra is transiting into a new party system under the leadership of the Bharatiya Janata Party. The second consecutive victory for the BJP–Shiv Sena alliance in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019 attributes a leading role to the BJP in the politics of the state. With the help of the National Election Studies 2019 data, this article tries to decipher the aspects of the still unfolding political dominance of the BJP and comments on the prospects of the state politics in the context of upcoming state assembly elections.||Rajeshwari Deshpande,Nitin Birmal

09-08-2019||perspectives||---------||Food Subsidy in Cash or Kind? : The Wrong Debate||The need for the public distribution system varies widely across states and districts. In some districts, the poor draw more than 80% of their grain from thePDS, but in other districts this share is less than 10%. A wide diversity of relationships with the PDS exist, suggesting a need for alternative modes of provisioning. A variable geometry of food provisioning might emerge, with cash working better for the needs of some districts and grain supply continuing to work better in other districts. Only a well-designed empirical test of the alternative modes will help ascertain the preferred shape of the PDS for a particular state or district.||Anirudh Krishna,Tushar Agrawal
09-08-2019||perspectives||---------||In Quest of Inclusive Growth||Economics needs an integrated approach for inclusive growth. But, this purpose is lost in the excessive focus on the separation of the subject into micro and macro and the obsession with rationality and general equilibrium for theoretical perfection. In such a context, the analysis of the factors contributing to the changes in the gross domestic product overlooks the distributional aspects, whereas statistics focuses on distribution in its search for approximating the regularity in data generated in a multivariate space. The feasibility of a new multidisciplinary framework for organising economic data in the quest of a paradigm inclusive growth is explored.||R B Barman
09-08-2019||special articles||---------||From Mobile Access to Use : Evidence of Feature-level Digital Divides in India||The digital divide is the disparity between individuals with respect to access to information and communication technologies. The growing prevalence of mobile phones in India is often linked to phones becoming access points to various government schemes and services. However, ICTs have various features that are not uniformly operated by different users. The use of mobile phones is examined using micro-level data to highlight how the socio-demographic characteristics of individuals (age, gender, literacy, etc) influence their engagement with the various features of a mobile phone.||Jang Bahadur Singh,M Vimalkumar
09-08-2019||special articles||---------||Restricted and Unrestricted Fiscal Grants and Tax Effort of Panchayats in India||The impact of restricted and unrestricted fiscal grants on tax effort of panchayats is examined using nationally representative panel data on finances. Three pathways are proposed through which these impacts accrue: wages, profits, and incentives. In order to deal with the simultaneities of grants received and taxation, a system of equations is estimated simultaneously, where the first stage equations predict the grants. The results show that a wage impact on taxation exists, but is very small and the productivity impact of grants on taxes is negligible. This means that incentive effects associated with the specifics of the intergovernmental fiscal system in the states are the main determinant of village taxation. Several policy conclusions are advanced.||Raghbendra Jha,Hari K Nagarajan,Anirudh Tagat
09-08-2019||special articles||---------||Groundwater, Gurus, and Governmentality : Seva in the Neo-liberal Development Regime in India||Temples and religious organisations undertaking community projects and welfare work have been a part of the history of South Asia. However, in the neo-liberal era, international governmental platforms, international funding agencies, multinational corporations, central and state government bodies, and international Hindu religious organisations are coming together to effect large-scale developmental efforts. The nuances of this shift are traced by comparing the groundwater management and conservation projects undertaken by the Swadhyay Parivar in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat in the early 1990s, and Art of Living across the country in the last decade. While many would argue that non-governmental organisations and faith-based organisations have occupied the void created by a neo-liberal state disappearing from the public sector, this paper shows that the state–international bodies–MNC–religion complex has regimented a large population in an all-pervasive governmentality.||Srirupa Bhattacharya

02-08-2019||commentary||---------||Verdict 2019 : Reinforcing Dravidian Identity Politics in Tamil Nadu||The Lok Sabha election results in Tamil Nadu clearly show the reconsolidation of the caste base and minorities and reinforcement of the Dravidian Tamil identity politics. The victory of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam establishes the second round of ideological discourse on linguistic cultural nationalism, secularism, and the regional aspirations within the framework of Hindutva. The election results in some ways indicate the reassertion of Dravidian identities and the key role for the Dravidian parties in the politics of the state.||P Ramajayam

This article examines the reasons for theBJP’s success and the failure of the Congress–Janata Dal (Secular) alliance to transform an anticipated dividend from electoral arithmetic. Caste calculus and ground-level chemistry had clearly adversely impacted on the Congress–JD(S) alliance and led to theBJP recording its best ever victory in the state.||Sandeep Shastri,Veena Devi

In particular, it investigates factors affecting the utilisation of maternal care services and choice of facilities between the pre- and post-NHM periods; assesses the success of the Janani Suraksha Yojana in enhancing institutional delivery, particularly in public facilities; and estimates the out-of-pocket expenditure on maternal care in the pre- and post-NHM periods and identifies factors affecting such expenditure levels.||Saswata Ghosh,Zakir Husain

02-08-2019||special articles||---------||Redesigning the Fiscal Transfer System in India||An overwhelming proportion of the poor live in low-income states in India. These states are home to over two-thirds of the children in the 0–14 age group. Therefore, provision of comparable levels of basic social services and physical infrastructure is important to ensure balance and stability in the Indian federation. This underlines the importance of intergovernmental transfers. Conceptually, general purpose transfers are given to enable the states to provide comparable levels of public services at comparable tax effort, and specific purpose transfers are given to ensure a minimum standard of public services. The shortcomings in both the design and implementation of the transfer system in India hinder its ability to achieve the objectives.||M Govinda Rao

While the 2019 draft bill includes all emigrant workers and students within its purview, it continues to exclude the family and undocumented migrants. Given the magnitude of family migration from India, this is a major oversight. Of the different stages of the migrant life cycle, the 2019 draft bill focuses mostly on pre-departure while ignoring the rights of migrants at their destination and their eventual return migration. For the draft Emigration Bill, 2019 to be truly effective, it needs a rights-based approach inclusive of all Indian migrants abroad.||S Irudaya Rajan,Varun Aggarwal,Priyansha Singh
25-07-2019||perspectives||---------||Unmoved by Stability : Capital Formation in the Modi Economy||The electoral promise of transformational economic change had potentially played a role in the decisive victory of Narendra Modi, particularly in the 2014 general elections. In power, his government actively pursued macroeconomic stability and a business-friendly regulatory framework. However, the investment rate of the economy has actually slid, and has remained mostly at a level that is lower than what it was when the government assumed office in 2014. This outcome is interpreted as the result of the pursuit of macroeconomic stability, in the belief that it is conducive to growth, however it may be achieved.||Pulapre Balakrishnan

25-07-2019||special articles||---------||Elementary Education in 19th-century Bengal : Education Policy of the British||In order to analyse the educational policy of 19th-century Bengal, two factors should be studied and evaluated critically. These are the changing notions of British imperialism and the educational development of contemporary Britain. The reasons for the neglect of natives’ education are many. These included keeping the Indians dependent on foreign rule for as long as possible, a fear that education would encourage liberal ideas and create a large class which would demand independence, or perhaps because Britain was backward in the development of education in the 19th century.||Sweta Dey

The history of internationalisation of higher education in China, including crucial phases from the Deng era, beginning in 1978 to the Xi Jinping regime is described.

A practical framework is presented to determine an EHP, considering coverage and equity perspectives for service delivery, financial protection and morbidity burden in the population. An analysis of morbidity data, unmet need for treatment, and impoverishment due to out-of-pocket spending reveals that a significant reduction in oop expenditure and impoverishment is possible through targeted inclusion of potentially high impoverishment-causing morbidities in EHPs. Such an approach may offer the desired flexibility in decision-making to policymakers, without compromising on benefits transferred to the needy.||Shankar Prinja,Atul Sharma,Indrani Gupta,Samik Chowdhury,Mayur Trivedi

Using 2011 enumeration block-level census data for five major cities in India—Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai—it is shown how patterns of caste-based urban residential segregation operate in contemporary India. The first visual snapshot of caste-based residential segregation in an Indian city is presented using geo-referenced enumeration block-level data for Bengaluru.||Naveen Bharathi,Deepak Malghan,Andaleeb Rahman

Through our three-part series we seek to initiate a debate towards prisoners’ civil and political rights. This series will cover prisoners’ right to vote, to write and to strike with the understanding that these rights, if granted, will expand the ever so shrinking spaces for an incarcerated person to express and reach out to the world outside highlighting conditions of the prison and their experiences, including those of torture.||

The article stresses why writing should be a duly recognised right of the prisoner. Further, the article shows how the writings of prisoners have contributed to reforms in prison conditions in India.||

This situation along with an absence of public health facilities, allows a fertile and lucrative ground to the private healthcare facilities to provide unnecessary and extreme treatments even for minor gynaecological ailments, including the removal of their wombs.

18-07-2019||perspectives||---------||Why India Needs a Crime Victimisation Survey||To be effective, policies on sexual violence against women must be evidence-based. In India, the National Crime Records Bureau publishes crime statistics based on first information reports. These constitute a useful summary, but do not provide policymakers the understanding to formulate a crime-fighting strategy. A national crime victimisation survey would supplement the NCRB data with critical inputs. Survey data could be used to further research in criminology and police reforms, assess the impact of punitive measures such as of the death penalty on the crime rate, and make informed decisions on legalising offences such as marital rape.||Nithya Nagarathinam

The increase in life expectancy has not translated into a healthier life, as prevalence of disabilities, their severity, and their association with non-communicable diseases have risen. Given the lack of access to assistive devices, specialised medical services, rehabilitation, and stigma attached to disability, the temptation to offer simplistic but largely medical solutions must be resisted. Instead, a multidimensional strategy is needed that helps the elderly overcome physical and socio-economic barriers as well as address the issues related to prevention and treatment of their underlying health conditions.||Veena S Kulkarni,Vani S Kulkarni,Raghav Gaiha
18-07-2019||special articles||---------||Braverman’s Legacy : Degraded Labour, Automation and Information Technology in the Era of Globalisation||Capitalism has countered the possibility of organised labour’s opposition to the deskilling and degradation of labour in terms of wages and labour power. This has occurred due to the implementation of global information technology and the imposition of international policies that ensure the free movement of capital and, to a lesser degree, the free movement of labour. This article attempts to explore, through the lens of Harry Braverman’s seminal work, the idea that skill degradation is not about the replacement of total aggregate labour by automation, but rather one of the means by which capital ensures that there is continued division and internal conflict of labour itself within and between national borders, and that labour competes with automated systems in terms of profitability.||Jamshed Sheriyarji

This state of innovation in India is analysed through the Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration for the period 2005–06 to 2016–17. The analysis shows that most of the innovations are management innovations, followed by technological innovations. They indicate some degree of direction in good governance and replicability. There is also need for some scouting mechanism for public administration innovations and for providing a replicable yet flexible template to promote them across the country.||Dipti Gupta,Ashok Kumar Pandey,Amit Garg

Emphasis, therefore, must be on the development of human capital. But, public education and health are not enough to break out of the middle-economy track. The world’s most pressing problems, from climate change to the future of work are all manifestations of inequality. The role of government is to not only be a more effective provider of learning and health, but also to be an agent for greater access to opportunity and changing patterns of ownership at all levels.||Avinash Persaud

Though the high level of uncertainty about its manifestation makes it difficult to deal with climate change, one of the most effective tools to deal with it is agro-biodiversity. It is important to move away from an exclusive focus on techno-fixes and towards time-tested resources like genetic diversity and indigenous knowledge.||Suman Sahai
12-07-2019||on practicing caste||---------||Destitute Thinking||Practising Caste embraces a courageous minimalism to tease out minimal, lowest-level constituents in the making of caste from practices of touch and counterposes them to the idea of society. Ethical impoverishment, the book tells us, is a precondition for and the initial form of new thinking and living. Destitution prepares the ground for inventing new forms of sociality.||Udaya Kumar

It strives to dispossess itself of caste as a marker of injustice in India. It presents a tropology that studies caste as the regulation of touch/untouch, pitching it at the level of intelligibility of the assembly language of computers that does not presuppose anything like a meaningful social whole.||Sanil V

11-07-2019||perspectives||---------||Amalgamation of Existing Laws or Labour Reform?||The Draft Labour Code on Social Security, 2018 of the National Democratic Alliance government was expected to reform existing labour laws and improve the state of the economy and labour. However, a close reading of the proposed code suggests that it is an amalgamation of existing laws, and the government has neither removed redundant provisions nor overhauled the existing provisions to make employment benefits available to employees in a quicker, simpler, and effective manner. The alteration of taxonomy and unification of older laws in the new code is likely to weaken the legal doctrine by destroying the comprehensibility of the law, and will lead to poor implementation.||Santanu Sarkar
11-07-2019||special articles||---------||How Much Public Debt Is Too Little?||Virtually, the entire literature on public debt is on determining “how much is too much,” beyond which it becomes a systemic threat to the economy. On this basis, about 80 countries, including India, have fiscal rules designed to steadily reduce public debt. This article argues that there is a minimum stock of public debt, below which it is also a systemic threat, and outlines some of the considerations which should be taken into account. It further argues that the composition of public debt is equally important, but has been totally neglected. Both the level and composition of public debt, therefore, should be taken into account while framing fiscal rules.||Pronab Sen

A comparison between the indices for public sector banks with private sector banks reveals that differences in governance structures cannot be explained fully in terms of ownership only. This is a welcome feature, as with some efforts on the part of the majority shareholder, corporate governance in all the banks can be brought on par with the best-performing bank, by ensuring greater compliance with corporate governance benchmarks.||Rekha Misra,Anwesha Das
12-07-2019||special articles||---------||The Question of Organisation : Beyond Marx, the Enduring Legacy of Lenin||The “Organisation question” necessarily devolves into two others—Organisation for What? Organisation by Whom? This question is faced by those whose goal is to carry out, in perhaps the very long term, the project of dramatically reducing, even seeking to completely eliminate, various human relations of oppression and exploitation while establishing an ecologically stable balance between human society and nature. Then, how are we to go about this given that our current context is marked by a dynamic and interacting economic-political duality of a capitalist process of globalisation and a persistent multiple nation states system? Since the nation state is and will remain for the foreseeable future the most important political unit, progressive transformations in some major countries are necessary to kick-start and accelerate the desired transformation at the global level.||Achin Vanaik

The increasing presence of migrant workers in the industry is a direct consequence of the deregulation of the gold industry in the early 1990s. While resorting to a labour process framework, this paper elucidates the process of recruitment and the composition of workforce. The empirical data is based on the findings and observations gathered through intensive fieldwork conducted during the course of three years, from 2010 to 2013, in the gold jewellery making industry in Thrissur and Kozhikode districts. This work also relies on a larger data set, the Inter-State Migrant Survey conducted by the Centre for Development Studies in 2012, which collected data on migrant workers from four districts of Kerala.||Sumeetha M

The existing literature makes a case for delivery of a host of specific interventions referred to as the direct nutrition interventions, along with sector-wise or systemic interventions, to bring about significant reductions in prevalence of stunting among children. An analysis of the delivery of DNIs in the said states shows that apart from the decline in fiscal priority for the DNIs during 2014–15 to 2017–18, there are also significant resource gaps for some of these interventions, which underscores the need for enhancing fiscal priority for these interventions.||Saumya Shrivastava,Nilachala Acharya,Chandrika Singh,Vani Sethi,Richa S Pandey,Rabi Parhi,Sourav Bhattacharjee,Abner Daniel,Preetu Mishra
04-07-2019||special articles||---------||Middle-class Women’s Labour Migration in Post-liberalised Cities in India||Despite the growing visibility of middle-class women in diverse service sector jobs in Indian cities post 1991, scant research has been directed to study the linkage between their migration dynamics and post-liberalisation changes in the country. This article investigates the patterns and trends of urban migration of middle-class women through the period of pre- and post-liberalisation (1983 to 2007–08); and the socio-economic correlates of their contemporary migration using the data from the National Sample Surveys. Contrary to the dominant stereotypes around women’s “unproductive” migration, the middle-class women’s employment- and education-linked migration turns out to surpass their marriage and family associated movements. The multivariable regression analysis shows that labour migration of educated middle-class women becomes more probable for single, Scheduled Tribe women, aged 21–59 years, having a certificate/diploma, and work experience as a regular/salaried employee at the origin, and coming from rural areas of another state.||Tina Dutta,Annapurna Shaw

Most Hindi film stories revolve around affluent Indians and endorse the social, religious, and cultural values of the Hindu middle class. By doing so, such films are also trying to construct a new form of nation and nationalism that is not fully inclusive.||Amit Ranjan

Self-managing cooperatives, which were to be independent of state control, started getting promoted as the preferred instruments for Cuba’s transition to 21st-century socialism. Drawing on fieldwork in Cuba and on secondary material, it is argued that these cooperatives have a fair chance of success, but that uncertainties exist, especially with respect to the project of “downsizing the state.”||Joseph Tharamangalam

But increasing private interventions for water control, such as farm ponds, mark the emerging importance of in-situ irrigation systems for India’s agrarian dynamism. A case study of farm ponds in Jharkhand finds the contribution of these in increasing the agrarian surplus through yield enhancement, crop diversification and crop intensification. However, the financial viability of such a system is scale dependent with farm ponds of only a certain size generating high benefit-cost ratio and internal rate of return.||Nirmalya Choudhury,Meghna Mukherjee

One of the important reasons for the disappointing outcomes in the state is the proliferation of the expenditure heads of public outlays by successive governments at different levels. Further, the rural sector has consistently lost its importance in the state’s public outlays, with a progressive diversion of public spending on the rural sector towards local-level administration, bypassing key sectors of rural development such as human resources development. This aspect has been a major driver of the unending rural crisis in the state. The evolving levels and patterns of the public expenditure on the rural sector over time are examined.||Baldev Singh Shergill,Ramanpreet Kaur
01-07-2019||review of rural affairs||---------||Uncertain Climate, Vulnerable Livelihoods : Role of MGNREGS in Risk Reduction among Rural Households in Telangana||With limited water resource endowments and a predominantly agrarian base, livelihoods in the semi-arid tropics are particularly vulnerable to climatic uncertainties and frequent droughts. The low levels of development of diversified livelihood options in the non-farm sector and a lack of skill base compel households to seek multiple low-income livelihoods to sustain the household in lean resource years. Among these, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme has provided the most significant coping mechanism for most households, particularly the poorest and most backward sections. The scheme may thus be seen as a prominent drought risk reduction policy. However, challenges of implementation arise when the policy manifests on field realities which tend to reduce the effectiveness and weaken its impact.||Manoj Jatav,Shreya Chakraborty

Using a framework of indicators in the domains of pest management, fertiliser use, soil health, water conservation, biodiversity, and efficient use of inputs, statewise report cards on ecological sustainability of agriculture are provided. There is much variation in the sustainability of production practices across the country, with some states characterised by high use of pesticides, low soil organic content, depletion of groundwater levels, low crop diversity, high energy use, and widespread nitrate contamination of groundwater.||Divya Veluguri,Ramanjaneyulu G V,Lindsay Jaacks

Programmes extending insurance cover for crops in India have long been in operation, but have not been able to include the majority of the agricultural sector within their ambit. Analysing the 70th Round Situation Assessment Survey data, collected by the National Sample Survey Office, the performance of crop insurance at the household level is examined and factors that determine its adoption are identified using an econometric analysis. The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is then analysed by looking more closely at the structure of the scheme.||Meenakshi Rajeev,Pranav Nagendran

The impacts of such capitalist development on rural livelihoods are explored. It is argued that reform in agriculture—through setting up of special agricultural zones and other similar means—needs to be undertaken for further rural economic development, in general, and for protection of agriculture-related livelihoods, in particular. The prospects of the rural industrial sector are also examined and, in this context, it is argued that the clustering of rural non-farm enterprises can pave the way for an alternative development paradigm.||Subrata Dutta

Other issues to be addressed include the scope of disaster management, the creation of mitigation funds, the financing of such funds, the procedure for states to draw from these funds and accepting foreign aid for disaster relief. This article examines these and related issues. It may not be desirable to complicate the GST structure by levying a cess on either state GST or central GST or integrated GST for funding disaster management. The option of increasing the yield of the present national calamity contingency duty or introducing a cess similar to the GST compensation cess may be preferable.||V Bhaskar,Vijay Kelkar
21-06-2019||special articles||---------||Intra-industry Trade of India : Is It Horizontal or Vertical?||The structure of India’s intra-industry trade, more specifically, decomposition of IIT into horizontal and vertical trade is analysed using support vector machines as the existing approaches to disentangle IIT into horizontal and vertical trade suffer from some limitations. For the period 1978–2013, at the SITC 5-digit disaggregated level, more of India’s IIT is of the horizontal type when compared to the Greenaway-Hine-Milner approach. This has important policy implications as far as trade-induced adjustments costs are considered. However, over time the share of HIIT in total IIT is declining, whereas the share of VIIT is rising which may indicate technological improvement.||Anwesha Aditya,Ishan Gupta

It also focuses briefly on issues of language and the way in which historical precedents are invoked. This is followed by a discussion on the wide-ranging changes envisaged in higher education. I suggest that the document needs far greater scrutiny than it has received so far, and that a hasty implementation will have grave consequences, diluting if not reversing the serious and painstaking attempts that have been made to democratise the contexts, and contents of education for decades.||

The first was the outbreak of the American Civil War, when seven slaveholding states declared their secession from the United States. The second was the uprising of the ­Polish people against Russian occupation. Marx’s analysis of these historic episodes also influenced his political efforts through the International Working Men’s Association. How Marx’s studies of both these events were relevant for his theoretical development and his political engagement is examined.||Marcello Musto

There is constant criticism of teachers’ performance on the grounds that despite paying high salaries to teachers, children are not performing well in examinations because the majority of teachers are not competent enough. An analysis of six Indian states offers the opportunity to address this debate from the lens of public provisioning for teachers in the school education system. The performance of teachers needs to be judged on the basis of factors like their training, working conditions, and, above all, resource allocation by the government.||Protiva Kundu

Yet, in their articulation, they allow us to engage with the ignored dimensions of Dalit personhood and reveal facets of city life that are less attended to.||Sadan Jha

And, it needs to be made clear at the outset that it is not the moralistic non-violent tenets underpinning Buddhism that attracted B R Ambedkar to it. Rather, the arguments put forth by Ambedkar for his conversion to Buddhism are much more nuanced. If we contemplate on these nuances and provide room for a creative reading of his need to embrace Buddhism, it opens up some interesting questions for our study of political theory, particularly concerning our understanding of violence and non-violence in politics.||Sreejith Sugunan

The findings bring into light the political, economic and environmental factors that have had a bearing on the politicians’ choice to introduce waivers. Further, it highlights that politicians choose from a variety of waiver policy designs, and this choice has substantive implications for the size of the waiver programme.||Ajit Phadnis,Aishwarya Gupta

A mechanism of payment for ecosystem services, which would compensate farmers for the value of the non-market agroecosystem services they produce, would address the issues of farm income and the deep ecological crisis in agriculture. This strategy would be within the fiscal ability of the government and would only use the existing allocation for agriculture. The institutional framework required to implement PES already exists. If properly implemented, PES could persuade Indian farmers to adopt ecologically sensitive agricultural practices which, in turn, could double farm income.||Lalit Kumar,M Manjula,Ramachandra Bhatta,L Venkatachalam,D Suresh Kumar,P Indira Devi,Pranab Mukhopadhyay

Moreover, this stress is only getting aggravated, even though Kerala’s tax effort has been recognised as above average. Studying available data with an alternative approach points to the failure of public resource mobilisation as the primary cause of this fiscal stress. The inability to harness the state’s fiscal potential, an incorrect perception about the state’s fiscal situation, and a lack of political will to address the situation have exacerbated the crisis.||Jose Sebastian

An assessment of existing tax efficiency and strengthening the tax administration could be one such alternative. The efficiency of tax administration varies across states. Given tax capacity, measuring tax efficiency is important to identify states where enhancing tax efficiency is likely to raise revenue gains considerably.||Sacchidananda Mukherjee

Women’s preference is overwhelmingly tilted towards the former employment opportunities as compared to the latter, due to flexibility of work and possibility of working from home, given certain sociocultural constraints and poor working conditions in other sectors. Moreover, limited access to capital for women’s own enterprises ensures that the chances for expansion and formalisation of their small enterprises are minimal.||Indranil De,Mukul Kumar,H S Shylendra

By studying conversion as a movement, this paper concludes that displaced subjects, say Dalits, who are perennially positioned out-of-space (outcaste), search and move towards an imagined home continuously.

Income inequalities, irrespective of farm size, are large, though these have not widened much over time; major sources are non-farm income, land, and farm assets. The relationship between growth in household income and land size is positive; it does not augur well for the government’s professed objective of promoting inclusive development. To bridge income gaps, mechanisms need to be developed to ensure the viability of increasingly small and fragmented landholdings.||Seema Bathla,Anjani Kumar

Drawing on five months of ethnographic fieldwork, the strategies of coercion and co-optation employed by the state government to persuade local landowners to part with their land and the socio-economic effects of dispossession and unemployment in Dalit communities are investigated. The urbanisation scheme can be characterised as a disaster in the making, with civil society unable to resist as the state government follows a high-modernist ideology of simplifying nature and society, implementing its plans through coercive power.||Dag Kolstø
17-05-2019||special articles||---------||Household Expenditure on Higher Education : What Do We Know and What Do Recent Data Have to Say?||Data from the two recent National Sample Survey Office surveys are analysed to provide estimates of higher education expenditure and loans. Households that participate in higher education spend 15.3% of their total expenditure on average in rural areas; in urban areas, they spend 18.4%. This share is larger in southern states, where individuals are more likely to be pursuing technical education in private, unaided institutions and are more likely to have outstanding borrowings for education. At the all-India level, poorer households are less likely to borrow for higher education, possibly because they are risk-averse and uncertain about future returns.||S Chandrasekhar,P Geetha Rani,Soham Sahoo

After the 1991 reforms, the government made inclusive growth the theme of development and undertook policy initiatives to boost rural employment. One such initiative, the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, 2005, aims to provide landless labourers and marginal farmers work in the lean season and, thus, income. It seems to have succeeded, although it has not created new jobs in general.||Hanjabam Isworchandra Sharma

08-05-2019||special articles||---------||Reporting of Violence against Women in Indian Newspapers||The media shapes public understanding of violence against women and girls, but until now there has been no systematic review of reporting on violence against women and girls in Indian media. This paper presents the results of analysis of over 1,500 articles from four mainstream Indian newspapers—two English and two Hindi—and measures these articles against several sets of guidelines for reporting on violence against women and girls. This analysis revealed that mainstream newspapers’ reporting on violence against women and girls is overwhelmingly incident-based, presenting this violence as a series of isolated events rather than a systemic social issue. Thematic reporting that explicitly challenges common myths about violence against women and girls, describes the difficulties survivors face in seeking justice, and provides information about support and resources for survivors, is very rare.||Amanda Gilbertson,Niharika Pandit

Based on the simple counting of food consumed by 240 households and conversations with women, this article explores the contrast between local knowledge of what constitutes a “good diet” and the deficient meals consumed by people in Odisha, a state in eastern India. Effective interventions need to look beyond “maternal responsibility” and address entitlement uncertainties and gender inequality, in order to ensure essential nutrition and good health of vulnerable groups such as women and children.||Sohini Sengupta

03-05-2019||perspectives||---------||The Neglect of Ambedkar : Perennial Problem of Sociology in India||Indian sociologists and historians have retained a certain foundational bias and blindness regarding caste. M N Srinivas’s theory of “Sanskritisation” saw underprivileged castes as aspirational, seeking social mobility. Socio-economic changes were seen as destabilising caste relations and leading to their disappearance. The persistence of upper-caste hegemony, and the resistance to it from underprivileged sections, does not corroborate the thesis forwarded by Srinivas and other sociologists and historians. The neglect of B R Ambedkar has been part of a strange refusal to acknowledge the political in caste.||Manash Firaq Bhattacharjee
03-05-2019||special articles||---------||An Inquiry into the Theoretical Structure Underlying the Labour Market Flexibility Argument in India||The theory underlying the labour market flexibility argument in India is identified and critically examined. A review of the empirical studies reveals that this argument is based on rigid real wages, in turn, explained by hiring and firing costs. Such explanations are provided by the insider–outsider theory of employment and unemployment due to Lindbeck and Snower (1988). A scrutiny of the I–O theory reveals that it could not even explain the existence of involuntary unemployment under reasonable assumptions. Further, it is shown that its policy recommendation necessarily assumes Say’s law. Thus, it is concluded the theoretical foundation underlying the LMF is unsound.||Anamitra Roychowdhury

The failure of the recent rules to recognise the role of the huge informal sector in collection and recycling of solid waste, one of the major reasons for the failure of BMHR, undermines their effectiveness. To overcome this drawback, an EPR mechanism integrating the informal collection system with formal recycling along with elimination of informal recycling units has been suggested.||Yamini Gupt,Samraj Sahay

An outline is presented here of the nature and effects of four decades of activism, policy interventions, and practice by South Asian feminist groups in Britain. This activism is located within the context of government policy and statutory practice that has shifted from multiculturalism to multi-faithism, and highlights the implications for women’s and girls’ rights, and the costs to secular feminist provision, particularly in relation to combatting violence against women and girls. How the recent neo-liberal policies of austerity and shrinking welfare provision pose key ideological challenges for South Asian feminist organising is analysed.||Sundari Anitha,Sukhwant Dhaliwal
26-04-2019||review of women's studies||---------||Minority Struggles and Quiet Activism : Experiences of Indian–Australian Women||The challenges that “minority” women encounter in Australia play a crucial role in expanding the language of feminism. From the author’s position as a diasporic Australian woman of Anglo-Indian Christian heritage, she explores the emotional struggle to challenge institutional racism in a country where whiteness provides symbolic and material privileges. This struggle has its roots in everyday acts of “quiet” activism that unfolded in Kolkata, India, where she was born. She had failed to see these as performances of feminism, however, because it veered away from the Brahminism of the feminist movement. The event of migration and racialisation as “ethnic,” “NESB” and “Indian” was a visceral experience that opened her eyes to the possibilities for more hopeful futures in Australian cities.||Michele Lobo

These market-oriented tools abstract forests from their sociocultural and ecological contexts and reduce their value for carbon forestry. These projects promote plantations of fast-growing species and undermine local knowledge and institutions. The available empirical evidence on the carbon forestry projects indicates that these have an impact on the rights and livelihoods of forest-dependent communities adversely. Hence, it is imperative to critically analyse them before scaling them up.||Ashish Aggarwal

A close examination of ancient Indian scriptures and colonial archival texts reveals how both had very different views about the so-called “criminal tribes,” which in turn affected the ways in which power hierarchies were constructed and maintained. Nevertheless, these marginalised groups put forth their own counter-discourse, which becomes evident through the analysis of two photographs from colonial archives.||Poulami Sarkar

Although crisis centres, known as helplines, exist to support those who experience violence, little is known about the experiences of women who use these services. Two rounds of surveys of 200 women who approached the government-sponsored helplines, conducted about four months apart, reveal that physical and sexual violence perpetrated by husbands and/or family members fell significantly in the inter-survey period. Women were also less likely to report suicidal thoughts and many reported a sense of economic security, happiness, self-confidence, and peace of mind. These findings underscore the importance of facilities offering women a haven in which they may learn about their options, have access to empathetic advocates, and secure support for addressing the violence they face at home.||Shireen J Jejeebhoy,K G Santhya

The Court has required the government to specifically authorise each resolution exercise and not delegate blanket authority to theRBI. This would matter in cases such as in the power sector where a misplaced privatisation policy explains the non-performing assets, which the government would now have to take into account. The Court’s order also makes it difficult for theRBI to pretend that it had no role in the generation of theNPAs.||C P Chandrasekhar
12-04-2019||commentary||---------||Investigating the Hunger Index : Evidence from Karnataka||The Global Hunger Index has directed attention to several methodological issues in understanding hunger. An attempt is made to formulate a Karnataka District Hunger Index using a modified version of GHI’s methodology, developed by the International Food Policy Research Institute. The findings show that backward pockets in the state have a higher hunger index, which also holds for socially and economically backward populations. The database at the subregional level should be strengthened for a better understanding of hunger-related issues.||S V Hanagodimath,V B Annigeri

In the facilitative aspect, 80% of the firms explicitly mention the reporting authority. Similarly, 80% of the firms have elaborated on how the reporting should happen, whereas only 10% of the firms allow complaints to be registered over phone. The findings indicate an urgent need to develop and enforce corporate policies to protect the whistle-blowers.||M V Shivaani,Thiagu Ranganathan
12-04-2019||commentary||---------||Challenges in Water Governance : A Story of Missed Opportunities||Seriously water-stressed and facing an unprecedented crisis, India is confronted with many challenges in the water sector, including the lack of reliable information on water, absence of any initiative to restructure the water institutions, a distressed groundwater lifeline, push for large dams, increasing footprint of the urban water sector, and the sorry state of its rivers. Yet, these fail to be taken up as electoral issues.||Himanshu Thakkar
10-04-2019||perspectives||---------||Constitutional Rights, Judicial Review and Parliamentary Democracy||While the contribution of the Supreme Court towards asserting the inviolability of constitutional rights is undeniable, the rightful limits of judicial intervention in the executive and legislative domains need to be questioned. In this context, the debate on related jurisprudential issues in the framework of a functioning parliamentary democracy is taken forward, and the principles defining the philosophy of judicial review have been discussed towards a holistic appreciation of the larger politico-constitutional issues.||Ashwani Kumar
12-04-2019||special articles||---------||Institutional Exclusion of the Hill Tribes in Manipur : Demand for Protection under the Sixth Schedule||Ever since the colonial government brought the hill areas by annexation into the fold of Manipur, which was then only the Imphal Valley, the hill tribes and the valley community have been “living together separately,” with certain separate administrative arrangements. The problems of present-day Manipur are the consequences of this forced integration of two different entities. After India’s independence, the hill tribes in the North East were protected under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, but the Manipur hill tribes were left out. This denial of the extension of the Sixth Schedule to Manipur is a process of institutional exclusion, which has led to the demand for greater autonomy.||L Lam Khan Piang
12-04-2019||special articles||---------||Medical Devices Manufacturing Industry : Estimation of Market Size and Import Dependence in India||Not much is widely known about the market size and dynamics of the Indian medical devices industry. The size of the market for medical devices and equipment in India and its dependence on import is estimated. The market size of medical devices and equipment has been estimated for the period from 2010–11 to 2013–14, which was found to have accelerated from $2.7 billion to $4 billion, while imports served 70% of the total domestic needs in 2013–14. The share of medical devices-based diagnosis in households’ out-of-pocket expenditure on health has increased from 2.2% in 1993–94 to 7.6% in 2011–12. Regulatory mechanisms must be put in place to bring all key medical equipment under price control in order to drive down prices.||Pritam Datta,Sakthivel Selvaraj

The FAO has developed a sound conceptual model for estimating the prevalence of dietary energy deficiency. However, the estimation methodology of the prevalence of undernourishment has been a subject of much debate. Important modifications are suggested in the estimation of the distribution of average calorie intake and average minimum dietary energy requirements. Using the latest available data and the revised methodology, it is shown that about 472 million people in India, a staggering 39% of the population, were undernourished in 2011–12.||Vikas Rawal,Vaishali Bansal,Prachi Bansal

At a time when development promises continue to elude agrarian and rural India, Singh’s ideas are worthy of serious attention because he presented a comprehensive critique of the development discourse in India from the perspective of agriculturists and the countryside. By noting why Singh’s written word should attract more attention, the paper goes on to mark the leitmotifs that may help one to navigate through Singh’s oeuvre. Further, it attempts to present an outline of three important developmental issues delved upon in Singh’s writings.||Praveen Dhanda
04-04-2019||special articles||---------||Managing the Water–Energy Nexus in Agriculture : Adoption of Water Management Technologies||Water management technologies, mainly micro-irrigation, help save water by 39% and energy by 58%. In 2025, the total demand for water in India is projected to be 886 billion cubic metre, and the total electricity demand 4,18,277 million kWh. Adoption of micro-irrigation is increasing at 1.22% per annum. If this growth rate continues, about 8.8 million hectares will be under micro-irrigation in 2025, and 24 bcm of water and 3,598 MkWh of electricity will be saved annually. To boost adoption, the government should promote cost-effective micro-irrigation system designs, simplify subsidy norms, and strengthen capacity-building programmes for farmers.||D Suresh Kumar,K Palanisami
04-04-2019||special articles||---------||Sustainability of Urban Water Supply and Sanitation in Dryland Areas : A Study of Indore City||The attainment of financial, environmental and social sustainability of urban service provision has become problematic nowadays. Within urban services, the supply of water and its disposal after use have become very important because water has to be brought from distant sources and the waste water needs to be treated before being discharged into natural waterbodies, both of which are very costly propositions. In dryland areas, which are physically water scarce and constitute some 70% of the country, the problem becomes even more acute. The water supply and sanitation services in the city of Indore in Madhya Pradesh are critically reviewed, and suggestions are made for alternative measures for a more equitable and sustainable water management system.||Rahul Banerjee

While in both the villages, sons continue to be preferred over daughters, it is the local political economy and culture that dictates whether a preference for sons would mean the elimination of daughters before birth, their relative deprivation post birth, marrying them off early as a mobility strategy, or simply differential allocation of resources within the household.||Ravinder Kaur,Charumita Vasudev
29-03-2019||commentary||---------||Some Macro-theoretical Foundations of Jobless Growth||An alternative heterodox explanation of the phenomenon of jobless growth is advanced, involving an interaction between demand and technical change. A mathematical condition is derived whose satisfaction ensures that both a high and low rate of growth of output results in a fall in the rate of growth of organised sector employment. During an output boom, the high rate of growth of labour productivity overwhelms the high rate of output growth, while in a period of slowdown the low or negative rate of growth of output more than compensates for the reduction in the rate of growth of labour productivity, resulting in persistent jobless growth.||C Saratchand

The authors have employed logistic regressions to estimate a vote function with political variables, such as incumbency, political alignment, and political party affiliation, as determinants. That incumbency reduces the chances of winning in close elections, and/or that incumbency disadvantage has been strong in the Hindi belt since the elections of 1998, especially in the states with lower real per capita income, higher share of rural population and low literacy rates are among the various interesting findings that emerge.||Ajit Karnik,Mala Lalvani,Manali Phatak

28-03-2019||money, banking and finance||---------||Central Banking in India : A Retrospect and Prospects||The flow of events and ideas behind central banking in India, in four distinct phases since independence—1950–70, 1970–90, 1990–2010, and post 2010—is narrated. The 1950–70 period is characterised as one of planned fiscal dominance, while the 1970–90 period has seen the dominance of the fiscal and financial sector with an inward-looking bias. Although there was partnership in crisis management and reform between the Reserve Bank of India and the government during 1990–2010, the period witnessed some differences between the government and the RBI in the areas of monetary management and external sector. The period since 2010 is broadly categorised by the rebalancing and adoption of a new framework, like inflation targeting.||Y V Reddy
29-03-2019||money, banking and finance||---------||Government Securities Market : Price Discovery, Monetary Management and Government Borrowing||Over 2017–18, there was a sharp rise in Indian government securities interest rates unrelated to fundamentals. Examining each of the standard explanatory variables shows them to be inadequate to account for the rise in bond yields in this period. Turning to aspects of Indian structure, the reason is found to be the narrow focus of monetary operating procedures, with excessive reliance on making up liquidity shortfalls with short-term liquidity, which was inadequate given large exogenous durable liquidity shocks, including foreign inflows. The composition of liquidity, share of reserve money and its sources all matter. Open market operations have a significant impact on yields. Large foreign debt inflows induce open market operations sales as G-Secs are swapped for foreign securities to sterilise the effect of inflows on the money supply. G-Secs yields are then found to rise.||Ashima Goyal

Using the macro risk and balance sheet variables under the directional connectedness framework, this study finds the underperforming periods of Indian banks and NBFCs. The findings are consistent with the systemic risk rankings of the Reserve Bank of India for the domestic banks and systemically important NBFCs.||Wasim Ahmad,Bhaskar Pathak,N R Bhanumurthy

Constructing a structural vector autoregressive model with the monetary policy rate, the pattern of monetary transmission to financial markets is examined over three distinct periods of regime changes in the Indian monetary policy and liquidity management framework. The empirical evidence indicates that there is sufficient period-specific transmission of monetary policy across the different segments of the financial markets. While the transmission of monetary policy to the money and bond markets is found to be fast and efficient, the impact of the policy rates on the forex and stock markets is limited.||Edwin Prabu A,Partha Ray

There is evidence of an improvement in the use of bank accounts over time. Robustness tests suggest that banks with a strong capital position and asset quality are more inclusive through their financial literacy centres, and the traditional bank agents continue playing an important role in this process despite non-traditional channels like mobile telephony. Yet, the findings show that the overall impact of financial literacy on bank account ownership is still limited. The analysis raises useful policy pointers to address those impediments that plague the process.||Saibal Ghosh

22-03-2019||special articles||---------||Structural Change Forecasts for India : Exploring the Feasibility of ‘Make in India’||India’s government claims to “transform India into a global manufacturing hub” and in the process raise manufacturing to 25% of gross domestic product and create 100 million new manufacturing jobs. This would entail a structural change comparable to that witnessed by several East Asian countries beginning in the 1960s. This study projects a formal-sector manufacturing boom over 20 years at the sectoral level, assuming India can take the necessary steps to initiate such a boom. Projection parameters are carefully constructed based on the Indian and the East Asian historical experience. The projections break out the key growth areas of formal-sector manufacturing and modern services to capture their unique characteristics. The results show large positive gains to aggregate output and employment from initiating an East Asia-style manufacturing boom. Reflective of the small size of the formal-sector manufacturing employment currently, the results indicate that the government’s specific employment goals appear unattainable in the next 20 years.||Russell Green

The major goal of the compact is to assist nation states to frame well-managed migration policies. India’s decision to sign the compact comes as a real surprise in the face of the country’s historical reluctance to sign international migration laws and treaties.

The transition from a dominant-party system to a fragmented system characterised by several smaller regionalist parties and, more recently, the Bharatiya Janata Party, coincides with the rise of religious divisions and the persistence of strong caste-based cleavages, while education, income and occupation play a diminishing role (controlling for caste) in determining voters’ choices. More importantly, there is no evidence of the new party system of being associated with changes in social policy, which corroborates the fact that in India, as in many Western democracies, political conflicts are increasingly focused on identity and religious–ethnic conflicts rather than on tangible material benefits and class-based redistribution.||Abhijit Banerjee,Amory Gethin,Thomas Piketty

The results suggest that in faster-growing states, poverty levels have declined, but poverty intensity has not changed and the highest increase is in inequality. An examination of the performance of development spending (which should mostly benefit the poor) incurred by the states indicates that though faster-growing states showed high spending on the development sector, development spending benefited the rich more effectively than the poor—contrary to the intent behind it—thereby raising inequality in the state.||Nishant Chadha,Bharti Nandwani

How the existing East–West Corridor and the proposed transboundary corridors such as the Trilateral Highway, the Kaladan Multimodal Transit Transport Project, and the Bangladesh–China–India–Myanmar Economic Corridor connecting India with neighbouring countries in the eastern neighbourhood would stimulate economic activities in the North East is examined. It is found that the corridor-based development projects may generate economic activities and regional development, which, in turn, would influence economic growth through higher production and consumption.||Prabir De,Sunetra Ghatak,Durairaj Kumarasamy

While the NRC has attracted much of the public attention, the process of categorising D-voters is largely functioning in a silent manner and has caused unprecedented damage to the lives and livelihoods of millions of marginalised people of the state. The D-voter is a political tool solely based on baseless doubts and is used by the government to deprive lakhs of marginalised people of a series of constitutional, political and social rights, including the right to vote.||Nazimuddin Siddique

The discipline of economics is no exception. It is argued that mainstream economics reduces social life into exchange value calculus and mathematical formalism, and fails to confront vital issues like widening inequality and poverty. The recent challenges thrown up by Thomas Piketty may help the discipline to re-examine its epistemological foundations to facilitate relevant teaching and research as well as policy choices.||M A Oommen

In relatively developed and less developed states, a causal flow exists from real sector growth to increase in public expenditure, in line with Wagner’s hypothesis. In least developed states, however, bidirectional causality exists between both capital and revenue expenditure to growth, and from growth to capital and revenue expenditure.||Madhumita Ray,Minaketan Sarangi,Sibanjan Mishra

An analysis of the implementation of the Karnataka Valuation and e-Registration project reveals that while it has facilitated convenience and accessibility by reducing the turnaround time of the registration process, it has not reduced information asymmetries or provided assurance of the legal validity of property transactions. This is due to a narrow conception of e-governance which does not seek to alter the incongruities that exist in prevailing state–citizen relationships, in general, and the role of the state, in particular.||Amit Prakash,Anjali Karol Mohan,Bidisha Chaudhuri

The data, however, do not seem to capture the extent of urban distress in totality. Yet, given the general dearth of evidence on the status of household indebtedness over time, institutions like the Reserve Bank of India and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development should revisit this information to resurrect their roles in strengthening credit delivery to the general population.||J Dennis Rajakumar,Gyanendra Mani,S L Shetty,Vishakha M Karmarkar

These factors cause disaggregate, or regional, inflation, which in turn coalesces into aggregate inflation. Food inflation is a typical example. Spatial factors and rainfall are the most important determinants of disaggregate food inflation. Local inflation differs from aggregate inflation; the rate of inflation varies by city and commodity; and the determinants of rural and urban inflation are different. In addition to demand management policies, aggressive supply-side policies are the need of the hour.||Anuradha Patnaik,Neeraj Hatekar

A number of different occupations are likely to see an increased rate of automation in the near future. However, while studies have shown that this is likely to have an adverse effect on employment, they have all used the occupation-based approach to arrive at their conclusions. A task-based approach is used to arrive at a more accurate estimate of the effect of automation on manufacturing employment in India. Employing a comprehensive data set from the International Federation of Robotics, the nature and extent of diffusion of industrial robots into the manufacturing industry in India is also analysed.||Sunil Mani
22-02-2019||special articles||---------||Utilisation, Fund Flows and Public Financial Management under the National Health Mission||Since April 2014, funds for various centrally sponsored schemes, including the National Health Mission, are being transferred to implementing agencies through state treasuries. This has added an additional layer in the institutional structure for nhm fund flows. We analyse the utilisation of nhm funds in 29 states in two recent years, and the time taken for release of these funds from state treasuries to implementing agencies in three selected states: Bihar, Maharashtra, and Odisha. On average, only about 55% of funds allocated for nhm were utilised in 2015–16 and 2016–17. In Bihar and Maharashtra, this was partly due to significant delays in release of funds from state treasuries to implementing agencies. The delays were a result of complex administrative procedures associated with the release of nhm funds from state treasuries.||Mita Choudhury,Ranjan Kumar Mohanty

An in-depth study of the employment terms and conditions of various categories of casual teachers in the higher education sector of West Bengal reveals that discrimination of casual teachers is deeply entrenched within the academic environment. This affects the self-esteem and well-being of the teachers and, in turn, leads to a deterioration in the quality of education imparted. Ensuring decent and equitable working conditions for casual and part-time teachers is essential for strengthening the higher education sector, which is necessary for nurturing a well-trained workforce.||Sritama Mandal,Susmita Mukhopadhyay

The concerns of the Jats are embedded in twin processes initiated in 1991: the “Market” and the “Mandal.” Led by economic liberalisation, the job market demands certain attributes and levels of education and social skills to profit from its growth process. The implementation of the Mandal Commission’s report has facilitated the relative mobility of lower castes such as OBCs and Dalits through reservations in government jobs and education. The Jats have responded to this crisis by changing the discourse from one of domination to one that highlights their deprivation to bolster their demands for OBC status.||Christophe Jaffrelot,Kalaiyarasan A

Important gains have been made, including broader coverage, lower targeting errors, accelerated PDS reforms, and a greater political commitment to food security. In four of the six reference states, the PDS seems to be doing reasonably well, but Bihar and Jharkhand still have a long way to go.

Despite the differences in water users’ associations in terms of genesis and self-reliance, many are seeking state support for sustaining the systems.

01-02-2019||commentary||---------||Compulsory Licensing of Pharmaceutical Patents in India : A Policy Shift||The trend of continued rejection of compulsory licence applications in India goes against the local generic drug manufacturers and public health safeguards incorporated in the Indian patent law. It raises serious questions about the intervening role of the state in patent monopoly to equalise the competing interests between patent holders and consumers of “public good.” This trend indicates a policy shift of the government regarding compulsory licensing.||Prabhat Kuamr Saha,Aditi Mukherjee
01-02-2019||commentary||---------||India’s Faltering Demand Conditions||Various assessments highlight the “robust” signs of revival and resilience shown by the Indian economy since the second half of 2017–18. Citing the near-term data, these not only undermine the demand-side instability that the economy has been witnessing since the past few years, but also underestimate the role of domestic demand as India’s primary engine of growth, unique amongst the major emerging economies. The assessement of the major components of aggregate demand and analyses of the growth rates of different sectors during the last few years reveal some interesting specifics for an economy that is yet to gain full momentum.||Isha Gupta
01-02-2019||alternative standpoint||---------||Unity in Diversity : Dream and Reality||After independence, the quest for unity required actions through which trust was created and an enabling environment provided so that different points of view could be presented and discussed, in place of being pre-judged and dismissed as suspect or politically motivated. It was a deeper commitment to a diverse India that prompted this form of action; it could not have been otherwise.||Gurpreet Mahajan

Using information from Karnataka and Rajasthan, the study highlights the advantages of combining DDO-level information with budgetary data. The significant benefits of using DDO-level information in India have implications for better estimates of public spending and health policy design.||Mita Choudhury,Jay Dev Dubey

The case study of the Adivasi Munnetra Sangam, a social movement in Gudalur in Tamil Nadu, is used to illustrate how fundamental shifts in control of power within the system can result in greater inclusion of oppressed groups.||Amman Madan,Rama Sastry,B Ramdas

The study reveals how a wide range of associated actors are connected to the UMPs, including lawmakers, regulators, health managers, and those who benefit from the UMPs, that is, mainly qualified doctors.||Shailaja Chandra,Sreedeep Bhattacharya

The results show that India lags behind many developing and developed countries in this area. In order to boost India’s trade competitiveness in the digital era, a Digitally-Informed Foreign Trade Policy is advocated that would aim to improve India’s digital infrastructure for trade, enhance the digital content in its exports, build digital skills in tradeable sectors, promote the use of digital technologies in manufacturing exports, and use big data analytics to inform foreign trade policy.||Rashmi Banga

They provide a new mode of interaction which entails de-territorialised economic cooperation and free trade architecture, thereby making the spatial domain of territory secondary in the global economic relations. Taking a cue from this, both India and China looked ahead to revive their old trade routes in order to restore cross-border ties traversing beyond their political boundaries.||

In this context, the controversial gross state domestic product estimates rolled out by the Department of Planning, Statistics and Programme Monitoring, Government of West Bengal are analysed and the veracity of the assertions made by the state’s finance minister in his 2018 budget statement is examined.||Prasenjit Bose

It is interesting, for there has always been a dark underbelly to stardom.||Boria Majumdar
23-01-2019||special articles||---------||Delivering Essential Nutrition : Interventions for Women in Tribal Pockets of Eastern India||In India, despite provisions for tribal development, 32% of tribal women are chronically undernourished, as opposed to 23% among those not belonging to tribal households.Large-scale surveys and routine monitoring are currently deficient in measuring the nutrition status of women, especially tribal women. This study was undertaken to analyse the reach of various health-related schemes for tribal women in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Odisha. In the light of its findings, it is recommended that all national schemes should be reviewed through a tribal lens, as tribes remain outside the ambit of most nutrition safety nets. Proven measures like strengthening tribal development nodal agencies, motivational incentives to fieldworkers and organised community involvement, need to be scaled up.||Vani Sethi,Sourav Bhattacharjee,Sonali Sinha,Abner Daniel,Avinash Lumba,Deepika Sharma,Arti Bhanot
24-01-2019||special articles||---------||‘Get Back to Life’ : Contradictions in and of Emergency Contraceptive Advertisements in Contemporary India||From the nationalistic “Hum Do, Hamare Do” (we two, our two) family planning advertising campaign, to the tantalising consumer-focused Kama Sutra condom advertisements, Indian media images have been instrumental in understanding the nation’s anxieties around sex, gender, population control measures and citizens’ reproductive lives. Drawing on this critically rich site of analysis, the tensions made visible in the advertising campaign for one particular emergency contraceptive—i-pill—are analysed by looking at three key elements: the photographic image, the tag line, and the health-related information text. It is posited that messages in contraceptive pharmaceutical advertisements are contradictory in their avowed message and intended aim.||Nayantara Sheoran Appleton
25-01-2019||special articles||---------||Market Awareness and Profitability : ​Case Study of Mango Production in Karnataka||A case study of mango farmers in Kolar district of Karnataka analyses the determinants of profitability and constraints faced by the horticulture industry in India in general. The mango value chain is explored in-depth to understand the market choices of farmers and the role of market intermediaries. The study is based on data collected from a primary survey of 131 farmers and uses an instrumental variable approach to model the profitability of farmers as a function of market awareness, distance from markets, farming practices, and control variables. It finds that in addition to age and education, distance to markets and farming practices are significant factors influencing the profitability of mango cultivators.||Madhuri Saripalle
23-01-2019||perspectives||---------||The Fifth Schedule of the Constitution : A Critique||The Fifth Schedule was intended by the founding fathers of the Constitution as an innovative device for promoting the welfare and advancement of Scheduled Tribes and the administration of scheduled areas. It confers uncommon powers for governance in scheduled areas, on the governor of a state having scheduled areas. In practice, however, the extraordinary legislative and executive gubernatorial powers have hardly been deployed despite the recommendations of various panels. It is felt that with some key reforms, the Fifth Schedule can be transformed into a purposeful instrument for the upliftment of STs.||Bhupinder Singh

Even the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments do not sufficiently empower the panchayati raj institutions or urban local bodies to respond to the needs of citizens in a democratic manner. With growing urbanisation, the problem of democratic deficit in the cities is going to become even more acute.||Alok Prasanna Kumar

18-01-2019||commentary||---------||Dynamics of General Strikes in India||The character of workers’ protests has significantly changed in the post-reform period thanks to the neo-liberal forces that have sought to weaken the collective institutions.

18-01-2019||commentary||---------||How Gender-sensitive Are India’s Energy Policies?||The two flagship energy policies in India—the Integrated Energy Policy and the National Energy Policy—fail to recognise women’s gendered role in production, access to energy, and formulation of energy policies and programmes. Recent gender-sensitive energy programmes like the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana and the Saubhagya scheme need to be replicated and scaled up to improve the energy security needs of women.||M Manjula
18-01-2019||commentary||---------||The Constitutional Case against the Citizenship Amendment Bill||The Lok Sabha passed the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill on 8 January 2019. In fact, the central government had started taking small and discreet steps towards the enactment and implementation of the law since 2015 itself. The bill violates the Constitution because the classification it adopts is manifestly arbitrary and unjustified. Citizenship law defines a country’s political and constitutional identity. Laying down rules that determine membership in our political community only on the basis of one’s religious beliefs completely violates this principle.||M Mohsin Alam Bhat
18-01-2019||commentary||---------||The Supreme Court’s Death Penalty Focus : Reflections on Sentencing Developments||In end-2018, the Supreme Court commuted the death penalty in 11 cases to life imprisonment and also clarified the mitigating individual factors. Nonetheless, there are procedural and normative questions that need resolution. The lack of coherence in explaining the significance, meaning, and character of the concept of mitigating factors in sentencing exercises leaves room for subsequent judgments to easily disregard them.||Neetika Vishwanath,Ninni Susan Thomas
18-01-2019||special articles||---------||Changing Task Content of Jobs in India : Implications and the Way Forward||In India, between 1983 and 2011, non-routine cognitive analytical task intensity jobs increased, as did non-routine cognitive interactive task intensity jobs, in line with the global trend. Manual task intensities declined, but the routine cognitive task content did not decline. Technology is likely a major factor behind this evolution of non-routine cognitive task intensities, whereas structural changes and changes in the supply of labour have shaped the manual task contents. The changing task content of jobs underlines the growing importance of cognitive skills. There is, therefore, a call for upgrading the Indian education system.||Pankaj Vashisht,Jaydev Dubey
18-01-2019||special articles||---------||Financing the Micro and Small Enterprises in India : Antecedents and Emerging Challenges||A close look at the data on flow of bank credit to the micro and small enterprise sector in India since the 1970s reveals that the strategic intent of reorienting the industrial policy in the mid-2000s by carving out a new category called the micro, small and medium enterprises has not served any useful purpose in terms of making institutional credit available to the mses. It is also observed that the pro-market financial inclusion rhetoric of the second half of the current decade has not helped the msmes, especially those engaged in manufacturing activities, to enhance access to bank credit. The much-publicised Micro Units Development and Refinance Agency scheme, at the same time, appears as a mere window dressing as it has not infused any new funds into the system.||Tara Nair,Keshab Das
18-01-2019||special articles||---------||Retelling an Epic through a Modern Ballad : Michael Madhusudan Dutta’s Meghnadbadh Kavya||The paper seeks to examine the circumstances under which Michael Madhusudan Dutta, the 19th-century Renaissance poet of Bengal chose the slaying of Ravana’s son, Meghnad, as the subject for his magnum opus, with many of its facets being etched indelibly on the Bengali psyche in supersession of other prominent Ramayans. Was Michael trying to show the parallels between the Indian and European mythologies? Was it because of nationalistic fervour that Michael sought to show the Rakshas as defending their nation against invaders? Was he influenced by the glamourised Ravana and Lanka of the Tamil or the Telugu Ramayans?||Nandan Dasgupta

18-01-2019||-------||---------||Is the Aspirational Districts Programme Merely A Political Device?||As the 2019 Lok Sabha elections approach, the Modi government’s failure to fulfil the promise of development is gaining more attention. The Transformation of Aspirational Districts Programme, launched in early 2018, is now being promoted in order to salvage the government’s reputation on this account. An ambitious programme, launched after the dissolution of the Planning Commission and in the age of the NITI Aayog, it is not merely a political device. The programme also reflects what has become of the development project in India under neoliberalism, especially after the end of planning. This article comments on some of the programmatic strengths and weaknesses of the Aspirational Districts programme alongside its approach to and discourse of development.||
23-01-2019||-------||---------||Despite Free and Fair Elections, Our Idea of the Republic Is at Risk||On the occasion of India’s 70th Republic Day, it is worth considering how the very foundational idea of a republic, in which supreme power is held by the people, is at risk despite free and fair elections. To arrive at that argument, this article delineates the historical trajectory of India’s Right to Information movement as arising out of the need to address the unfinished agenda of democratisation since independence. It then discusses how the movement has strengthened oppositional politics by expanding the terrain for political participation and has also empowered individual citizens in their struggles to claim their entitlements from the state. By resisting scrutiny under the Right to Information Act and attempting to dilute the law’s empowering potential, political representatives and bureaucrats are subverting democracy itself.||

However, the evidence suggests that this would not go very far in helping the units in this large sector. This gives rise to the suspicion that the real intent of the move is to open the door to a return to a regime wherein bad debt, resulting from default on debt service by large corporate borrowers, is restructured at the cost of the taxpayer.||C P Chandrasekhar

The common tropes of this culture and identity are more of a political construct and are used as a potent tool to unite against external forces. These constructs are analysed in light of the response by civil society, the government, and Adivasi communities to the book The Adivasi Will Not Dance: Stories by Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar.||Sujit Kumar

In light of the central government’s recent move to launch insurance-based targeted healthcare provision, a case is made for paying attention to building public health infrastructure based on Tamil Nadu’s experience with healthcare provisioning. The pitfalls of insurance-based provisioning and targeting, and the need to recognise regional trajectories and institutional innovations in this regard are highlighted.||Gayathri Balagopal,M Vijaybaskar

Analysing population data at the level of parliamentary constituencies has the potential to bring political accountability to the data-driven policy discourse that is currently based on district-level estimates. Using data from the fourth National Family Health Survey 2016, two geographic information systems methodologies have been developed and applied to provide estimates of four child malnutrition indicators (stunting, underweight, wasting, and anemia) for the 543 parliamentary constituencies in India. The results indicate that several constituencies experience a multiple burden of child malnutrition that must be addressed concurrently and as a priority.||Akshay Swaminathan,Rockli Kim,Yun Xu,Jeffrey C Blossom,William Joe,R Venkataramanan,Alok Kumar,S V Subramanian
11-01-2019||special articles||---------||Climate Change and Rural Poverty Levels in India||Although there is wide recognition of the adverse impacts of climate change and extreme weather events on poverty, there is hardly any empirical evidence to substantiate this. The trends and the role of agricultural growth and other factors on rural poverty in India—which has the largest concentration of the poor in the world—have been analysed, and the likely changes in rural poverty levels in India under alternative climate scenarios have been assessed. Evidence presented here suggests that rural poverty trends in India, which witnessed a significant decline during the post-reform period beginning from 1991, may get reversed and may increase due to the likely adverse impacts of climate change on Indian agriculture, and other drivers of poverty. Not only will the proportion of poor population likely rise, but also the depth and severity of rural poverty measured through the poverty gap index and squared poverty gap index may aggravate sharply in response to warming temperatures and other climatic changes.||K N Ninan

As websites sometimes claim to be intermediaries which cannot be always held responsible for the nature of content uploaded online, the issue of intermediary liability needs to be addressed urgently. The precedent set by the Supreme Court in this regard in certain cases merits critical examination, in order to pave the way forward for developing an alternate intermediate liability regime, which can walk the tightrope between censorship and the protection of the dignity of women and children in cyberspace.||Amrita Vasudevan

04-01-2019||special articles||---------||Social Compliance Audits in Garment Factories : The Case of the National Capital Region||The violent clashes between workers and employers in India during the recent decade are testimony to a new terrain of labour struggle unleashed by the neo-liberal economic system. These clashes speak of the demise of the workers’ freedom of association and consequent waning of collective bargaining in the context of the phenomenal growth of private regulation of labour. Various private voluntary regulations introduced in the name of corporate social responsibility, potentially to protect workers from capitalist exploitation, have actually yielded contrary outcomes. By examining the example of social compliance audits, this paper brings out the trade-off between capital and labour in the global supply chains, and the corroborating demise of workers’ rights, which CSR initiatives do not mitigate.||Archana Prasad

Rubber and pepper traders depend highly on the futures markets price signals to trade in the spot markets and relate it to spot market prices. Factors like education, income, trading experiences in futures markets and in other financial markets influence traders’ participation in futures market. Lack of networking, risks, difficulty in managing spot and futures markets, lack of adequate technological knowledge and skills are the major constraints faced by the traders in futures markets participation.||Sumalatha B S
04-01-2019||special articles||---------||Speaking of Abuse : The Pyramid of Reporting Domestic Violence in India||In India, most women who experience domestic violence do not share their experience with anybody or seek help. Among those who do, a “pyramid of reporting” exists. Informal sources (natal family and friends) are favoured; very few report violence via institutional routes (non-governmental organisations and police). The conditions under which incidents of domestic violence are reported, and/or help is sought through different routes—along with the reasons why such conditions often do not occur—are highlighted using large-scale secondary survey data and primary ethnographic data. The findings have implications for mitigating domestic violence through institutional routes.||Suraj Jacob,Sreeparna Chattopadhyay

But, growth in a year may be poor as much due to the good monsoon or abnormally wet conditions in the previous year as the poor monsoon during that year, or it may be high due as much to the poor monsoon in the previous year as to a good monsoon of the year or to policy reforms. As the rainfall fluctuates annually, medium-term growth rates should be assessed; the annual rainfall in the base year should be close to normal.||M Dinesh Kumar,Arijit Ganguly,M V K Sivamohan
