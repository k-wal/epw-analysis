What does it mean to be a Hindu? Several people have asked this question with reference to theological position and ritual practice. It is asked here with reference to political practice in India over the last hundred years or so. The immediate context for this enquiry is of course provided by the political developments of the 1980s, marked as these were by renewed and aggressive demands for a recognition of what are called Hindu rights and the Hindu basis of Indian nationhood. It needs to be asked how the category of the Hindu is constructed by the votaries of Hindu nationhood, who is included among the elect and who is excluded, and what is meant when so-called Hindu leaders and writers speak about Hindu interests. This paper constitutes a preliminary attempt at examining some of these questions.||Gyanendra Pandey

These ratios are close to or exceed those in the pre-FERA years. And if the very high levels of capital inflow since then are taken into account, the picture today is still more gloomy. For all its deficiencies, the FERA did succeed in curbing to some extent the growth of the foreign sector in the mid-1970s, but the liberalisation after 1980 put the clock back.

The problem however is that often no such women's groups exist in many rural areas. How then can empowerment be facilitated? This paper describes and analyses the process of implementing a small-scale irrigation project in the Terai region of West Bengal which aimed specifically at empowering women in the absence of grassroots women's groups.

Additionally, it is going to hurt the poor via cuts in schemes like the rural employment generation programme. In the fiscal sphere, pace the budget for 1991-92, the larger issues still remain to be addressed. The tax system needs to be restructured. The overwhelming reliance on indirect taxes has to be reduced and the base of personal income tax has to be widened. Simultaneously, there has to be the political will to take stern measures against tax evaders and operators in the parallel economy. And, above all, there has to be a determined effort to curb wasteful current expenditure, and not capital expenditure on social and economic infrastructure. This is a rather daunting agenda, but a beginning has to be made.||Pulin B Nayak

Although the mid-1980s drought was the harshest in living memory, foodgrain price stability and the widespread availability of consumption credit permitted villagers to maintain their consumption pattern of normal years. Still, the experience should not be catalogued as a complete success. Much of the unemployment endured by labourers, particularly women workers, could have been averted by a timely-and locally-available public works programme. The lack of water was probably the greatest constraint to the well-being of all villagers. When compounded by a severe shortage of electricity, the scarcity of readily available clean water led to a sizeable increase in water-related morbid symptoms in the second drought year: diarrhoea, eye infections, and scabies. Similarities and contrasts with other micro-studies of drought consequences are highlighted and implications are drawn for drought relief policy.||P D Bidinger,T S Walker,B Sarkar,A Ram Murthy,P Babu

An excessive concern with colonial state policy-particularly revenue policy-has given way to greater sensitivity to the regional and sub-regional context of agricultural growth. This essay is focused on one aspect of agricultural growth namely arable expansion in the Chotanagpur administrative division of Bihar between 1880 and 1950. Review of the evidence on arable expansion at the divisional and district level and examination of the relative importance of the causal variables related to demography, institutional structure and the market in influencing the course of agrarian expansion is set against the backdrop of the specific ecological and institutional milieu in which the changes took place.||Prabhu Prasad Mohapatra

20/7/1991- ||special articles||41498470||Income Inequality and Elasticity of Personal Income Tax||This paper develops a technique for estimating the effect of a change in inequality in the distribution of income on the yield of personal income tax. The technique is applied to estimate the effect of income inequality on the yield of personal income tax in India. It is found that, for a given tax schedule, an increase (decrease) in inequality in the distribution of income among the taxpayers increases (decreases) yield of personal income tax in India. Further, the study brings out that in India, during 1966-67 to 1983-84, inequality in taxable income was marked by a declining trend, and this had substantial negative impact on elasticity of the tax. Had the inequality remained unchanged, elasticity of the tax with respect to gross domestic product would have been around 1.49 instead of 1.17. Government policies directed at mitigating inequality in the distribution of income seem to dampen growth of yield of the personal income tax. This is an important factor that should be explicitly taken into account in the tax revenue forecasting exercises. If the inequality is expected to decline at a rate lower than that in the reference period, then the effective elasticity would be in the range of 1.17 to 1.49, and if it is expected to decline at a rate higher than that in the reference period, then the effective elasticity may be well below 1.17.||Pawan K Aggarwal

Did the prosperous regions experience higher rates of population growth, either through higher rates of natural increase or through immigration? What is the demographic picture of areas of stagnation and decline: Are they marked by high rates of mortality and out-migration? One can ask similar questions about the extent to which population pressure has led to land or labour intensification in areas experiencing drastic declines in land-man ratio.

Thus women cannot be viewed as a homogeneous group nor can one assume gender-based discrimination to prevail. An alternative model proposed makes it possible to analyse gender issues within the theoretical premises of social class formations and their exploitative relations.||Saraswati Raju
14/9/1991- ||special articles||41627001||History as Critique and Critique(s) of History||The historiographical effort of Subaltern Studies has been described as 'history as critique' and imperialism and imperialist knowledge are seen as the subjects of this critique. By this measure the Subaltern Studies project, which began as an intervention in post-colonial debates in Indian history is at least potentially capable of transforming the very idea of history itself the discipline that is represented in university departments organised under that name. This essay explores the ramifications and implications of this claim regarding how the global and the local come together in the post-colonial scene of writing history. The essay goes on to discuss the manner in which certain strands of post-modernist writing have handled the theme of 'death of history'.||Dipesh Chakrabarty

An important proposition derived from this framework is that effective public liability can be sustained only when government's "hierarchical control' over public service providers is reinforced by the public's willingness and ability to 'exit' (the presence of competition) or to exert pressure on the providers to perform (the use of 'voice'). The paper also examines the conditions under which the use of 1 and voice is likely to be efficient and offers a menu of options to strengthen public accountability.||Samuel Paul

This paper makes use of the Cost of Cultivation Reports of the government of Karnataka to analyse the growth potential of the new dryland technology and characteristics of market environment. The data and contextual evidence suggest that dryland agriculture in Karnataka is handicapped by a combination of three unfavourable factors: harsh physical conditions, inadequate and indifferent policies and competition from the more productive parts of agriculture. These factors are an adverse influence on the thrust for growth of the new dryland technology and on the market environment for dryland crops. More important, they appear to create attitudes among policy-makers not conducive to the evolution of a strategy based on development of conservation-oriented technology, use of local-and, often, degraded-resources and mobilisation of the people.||V.

06/7/1991-13/7/1991||special articles||4398123||Declining Incidence of Poverty in the 1980s: Evidence versus Artefacts||By constructing appropriate cost of living indices, which allow for the observed variations in consumption patterns and prices across states, the state-specific rural and urban poverty norms as well as the corresponding estimates of the incidence of poverty in 20 states and all-India in 1987-88 are presented. A set of criteria for ranking of states according to poverty alleviation performance is suggested. However, the reported numerical exercise in ranking is taken to reflect only a descriptive monitoring of the observed performance of different states between 1970-71 and 1987-88, without any pretensions to the analysis of the underlying causes of inter-state differences in performance on the poverty front. The paper also shows that the massive reduction in the incidence of poverty in 1987-88, as reported by the Planning Commission in 1990, is once again largely a consequence of the peculiar statistical artefacts used by the Commission. Just as it did with the 1983 NSS data, the Planning Commission has continued to indulge in mindless tinkering with the observed NSS size distribution of consumer expenditure for 1987-88 also. Appropriately computed incidence of poverty in 1987-88 (affecting appropriate price adjustment at the state level for the relevant poor population) comes to about 48.7 and 37.8 per cent, respectively, in rural and urban India, rather than the artificially low estimates of 32.7 and 19.4 per cent reported to parliament by the Planning Commission in 1990.||B.

It is argued that the revenue raising potential of this measure was largely frittered away in 1990-91 due to the availability of many tax offsetting provisions in the present corporate tax system and the auttior attempts to identify the major leakages and suggests measures to plug them. It is also suggested that this measure of disallowance of depreciation be tried again in 1991-92 after removing the identified leakages.||K C Sharma

1/3/1991- ||the third dimension||4397434||Photography and Society: Icon Building in Action||If one were to propose a theory of photography, it would necessitate the rigorous constitution of the object of the theory and a clear delineation of its boundaries, that is a binary classification of the area of study in terms of the photographic and the non-photographic. Such a categorisation would have its limitations, lose a wealth of detail, miss out the essential political function of photographic practice, and result in a study which would approach photography at the level of the structure of the medium, its grammar, rather than its practice. In contrast a study of the photographic in the realm of its practice would try to account for it in all its 'impurity', as it interacts with and gets inflected by the word, sound and thought. It would try to grasp the politics of photography at the level of its interactions with discourse, its collusion with the state and its institutions, and its determinations by investment and apparatus. This article attempts such a study which while it does not attempt any topological or methodological rigour, facilitates discussion and permits access to areas which would not fall under the strict theoretical category of still photography. The result of such a study would not be a theory, but would more satisfactorily be termed as an analytic of photography; an analytic which, instead of asking the question 'what is photography?' would ask instead 'how does photography work?'||R.

What role did women themselves play in this process of being drawn into the hegemonic fold and of themselves being agents in this hegemonic process? How did women fare in the 'self-making' of their classes and of themselves and what modes did they adopt in this necessary task of fashioning selves and society? The print media, magazines established by male reforming intelligentsia as well as by eminent women themselves, offered women a wide communicative space. An exploration of this material offers some understanding of the type of social subjectivity and agency that these women created for themselves.||Himani Bannerji

But rural employment and poverty cannot be studied without an analysis of the growth of agriculture, because even now as much as two-thirds of the workforce in India is employed in agriculture and much of the rural non-agricultural employment is influenced by the changes in agricultural output and incomes.||C.

26/1/1991- ||review of political economy, january 1991||4397241||Social and Cultural Components of Society and Appraisal of Social Reality||Culture, economy, and polity are three essential dimensions taken into account for the appraisal of social reality. While the interaction of the three dimensions was of concern to the pioneers in social science, specialisation began to lay unilateral emphasis on polity and/or economy from the late nineteenth century. But, as the emphasis failed to reveal reality precisely and comprehensively, attention on culture was revived in the second half of the present century. From the 1980s it has assumed an acute form. Among others, the Subaltern School of history-making and post-modernism as a principle of scientific analysis are illustrative of the new venture. In this context, it may be useful to examine the roles attributed to culture as a variable for the appraisal of social reality, and search for its apposite role with reference to growth and development of society. The objective of this paper is to initiate a discussion in this respect.||Ramkrishna Mukherjee

Outlining the broad contours of the evolution of the Indian economy based on existing literature, the author indicates the organic linkage between the development process, conduct of policies and the nature of the binding constraints on growth. It is from this that an argument for a complete re-evaluation of Indian development policies is developed and an alternative strategy for development proposed.||Pronab Sen

Though only nationalised banks and financial institutions are permitted to set up these funds there is increasing pressure to allow such funds to be set up in the private sector. It is time therefore to introduce appropriate legislation to govern the functioning of mutual funds. This paper discusses the various issues connected with the operation of mutual funds and proposes a set of regulations to ensure that they are effective. The proposed regulations draw heavily on the Investment Company Act of 1940, the US legislation on operation of investment companies.||Samir K. Barua,Jayanth R. Varma,N. Venkiteswaran

It is essential for both ecological and public health considerations that pesticide usage be cut down to an absolute minimum and that innovative ways be introduced to limit or possibly eventually eliminate their use. At the same time, it must be recognised that there is a large industrial commitment to chemical pesticides, and that it might be necessary to turn chemical industries away from the production of so much pesticide and in the direction of more ecologically and socially beneficial products. Considering the number of accidents that have occurred in India because of the handling of extremely hazardous chemicals there is a strong case for such a change. A small beginning has been made to lessen the use of pesticides by the use of integrated pest management regimes. A great deal more is still needed.||Joan P Mencher

7/12/1991- ||special articles||41625483||Trade Policies and Business Opportunities in Southern Asia||Business opportunities tend to multiply in economies which are open in the sense not only of liberal trade and exchange rate policies but also liberal internal economic policies under which saving and investment decisions are unhampered by government regulations; freedom to undertake any economic activity in response to profit potentiality is unrestricted, of course, within the usual parameters of the countries' social and political goals, and the innovative spirit and entrepreneurial leadership are given a free play. However, it has to be recognised that internal liberalisation can hardly progress unless it is accompanied simultaneously by the external liberalisation. In fact, one cannot function without the other. It is the adoption of these outward-oriented trade policies by the NICs and other east Asian and Pacific region countries like Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia which has contributed to their faster growth, which in turn opened up wider markets for foreign investment Thus, the internal growth opportunities reinforced trade opportunities in other countries and this reinforcing relationship eventually triggered the interest of modern industrial enterprises to set up new firms in east Asian countries. The southern Asian countries, on the other hand, have been slow to move in this direction, though there is now a wind of change in some countries like India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. But if they are to benefit from the dynamic international business sector, they will have to move not only faster than in the past but faster than their other Asian competitors on the international market.||Deena Khatkhate

The present paper focuses on the relatively recent developments in the Indian tea industry. Discussing briefly the features of the industry in respect of production, demand, exports and the nature of the market, both domestic and international, the paper follows it up with an analytical framework within which the industry may be studied and concludes with policy prescriptions.||Neelanjana Mitra

Calcutta, however, has followed a different path of change, for while it was abandoned by foreign and indigenous industrial capital soon after independence,' the continuing rural-urban disparity attracts large influxes of workers to the city who have little choice or scope for mobility, operating as they do within the constraints of persisting stagnation. This article argues that at the sectoral level, the case of Calcutta shows the kind of capital which dominates determines the path of change for the dominant mode of production, and also the nature and form of petty commodity activities articulated to the dominant mode.||Nandini Dasgupta

Other cause oriented groups rallied behind Cory Aquino and in February, Marcos had to flee the country unable to face the upsurge of people's protests. The 'national democratic movement' seemed almost irrelevant and it had soon to admit that its boycott decision had been at least a 'major tactical blunder'. While it is important to inquire why the boycott decision was taken and why the Left lost its initiative, this article explores why the radical Left failed to carry out materialist analyses towards a more fruitful and convincing understanding of political transformation in general, and in this case the growing importance of struggle for political democracy in particular within the framework of their basic theses.

The significance of the LDF platform and the new policy initiatives of its government (1987-1991) becomes evident against the background of the deep contemporary crisis of Kerala's economy, society and polity. The LDF's victory in 1987 and the performance of its government are analysed in this context. Arguing that the four years of LDF rule charted a new course of advance for the growth of the democratic movement and development of the state the paper undertakes a detailed comparitive analysis of the voting pattern and the course of events between the district council election in January this year and the assembly and general elections in June with a view to establishing the reasons for the LDF's defeat despite its achievements in office.||T.

Under the Second Republic the policy had begun to shift and the establishment of the Third Republic saw an uncompromising commitment to the policy of assimilation of the colonies to France through institutional devices. Upper caste Hindu resistance to this assimilation was masterminded by the enigmatic Chanemougam, the 'Nadou' of the Vellaja caste and a firm defender of the Brahmanical order. This paper captures this resistance by recounting the career of Chanemougam who established himself as the unquestioned ruler of the 'comptoirs, and appropriated the newly established institutions to his ends.||Jaques Weber

This paper attempts to formulate a model of this sector that takes into account its functional linkages with agriculture and urban activity through an explicit recognition of their spatial dimension in a more comprehensive way than permitted by purely sectoral or micro approaches to the problem. The outlines of a unifying regional labour demand-and-supply framework capable of exploring alternative hypotheses and of addressing relevant policy issues in an empirically organised fashion is delineated. The model is implemented through multiple regression analysis of the determinants of levels of and changes in overall rural non-farm activity and its industrially disaggregated components across the districts of Maharashtra. Apart from a general validation of the explanatory power of the model and a quantitative documentation of the role of hypothesised influences in a manner usually consistent with theoretical expectations, these exercises reveal an interesting structural heterogeneity between various non-farm subsectors in their labour force composition and regional correlates.||Vibhooti Shukla

Devaluation reduces the wage rate, and raises profit. This paper analyses the equilibrium of a firm in an imperfectly competitive export market. It transpires that a suitably devised scheme of wage-cum-profit-sharing can promote exports, keeping the firm's profit at the initial level, but raising the worker's earning in comparison with the post-devaluation regime. In this sense the proposal has the merit of somewhat Pareto-like optimality. It has two other remarkable advantages. First, the package can be used so as to maximise the volume of dollar revenue; devaluation as such can never perform this feat in a wage economy. Second, unlike devaluation, it has no contractionary effect on the economy.||Ranjit Sau

Just as most Indians instinctively recoil at the very suggestion of Kashmir's secession, among those who uphold the right of self determination, Kashmir's separation is an article of faith. A principle, however, does not have a priori application. More importantly, each time a demand for separation is made it reflects on the character of the polity from which separation is sought. This paper attempts to clarify the Kashmir imbroglio by investigating its genesis in the context of the Indian state's responses.||Gautam Navlakha

This is partly because of the predominance of agriculture-related policy issues in the majority of developing countries where agriculture plays a dominant role in terms of employment, income, export earnings and import requirements. Also, changes in technology and physical environment relating to agriculture are subject to a high degree of uncertainty. These issues are relatively new and knowledge about them is still evolving and as a result the formulation of possible policy options is in its early stages.||Nurul Islam

A careful scrutiny of the 'dynamics' of employment practices in the construction industry in Bangalore city suggests that the traditional informal sector paradigms which generally concede 'ease of entry' into any of the informal sector activities may be misleading. This paper attempts to analyse the various forces that operate in the construction industry as the labourers defend their job and wage levels in a situation of competition. The first section explains the historical roots of the recruitment system in the construction industry; the second provides a framework of contracting methods and contract labour; the third illustrates the recruitment process in the construction sector; the fourth assesses the role of the 'maistry' in the recruitment process; the fifth looks at the incidence of debt labour and economic familism and the final section identifies the prevailing symptoms of feudalism and the labour control process.||M.

1/3/1991- ||economy: an arrangement at stake||4397418||From a Fractured Compromise to a Democratic Consensus: Planning and Political Economy in Post-Colonial India||The discourse of planning in India has been heavily implicated in the statist paradigm. On a false analogy with the post-revolutionary situation in the socialist countries, the state has been seen as a virtually autonomous entity acting on a passive society-or rather a society that could be galvanised into appropriate responses as desired by the planners and policy-makers. To this oversimplified paradigm has been opposed the equally simplistic paradigm of the free market-which also posits an all-powerful state, but a state which is the source of all evil and all unproductive ('rent-seeking') activities. These opposites share a basic presupposition, viz, that the state in India can be regarded as an entity which is virtually disjoint from society. This presupposition is violated not only by the numerous devices used by the dominant elements in the ruling classes to manipulate the state apparatus, and by the strategic responses evoked by state action. It is also violated by the permeation of Indian society by various nationalities with their distinct ways of relating to the Indian state as a whole.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

This point is being made by many; a possible theoretical underpinning for it is provided here, namely, that allowing freedom to capital flows in third world conditions is likely to create a situation where more capital wishes to flow out of the country than wishes to flow in; and, under such conditions, reducing the level of activity in the country via a squeeze on real wages and investment caused by a depreciating exchange rate, as a means of stabilising the economy, is both economically absurd as well as socially pernicious.||Prabhat Patnaik

Other cause oriented groups rallied behind Cory Aquino and in February, Mareos had to flee the country unable to face the upsurge of people's protests. The 'national democratic movement' seemed almost irrelevant and it had soon to admit that its boycott decision had been at least a 'major tactical blunder'. While it is important to inquire why the boycott decision was taken and why the Left lost its initiative, this article explores why the radical Left failed to carry out materialist analyses towards a more fruitful and convincing understanding of political transformation in general, and in this case the growing importance of struggle for political democracy in particular within the framework of their basic theses.||Olle Törnquist

Sustainability, or rather survivability, in a situation of low pressure on resources was possible through traditional land extensive practices. In the changed circumstances with high pressure on fragile resources, the required high resource use intensity (for high productivity) with conservation is not possible through traditional measures. This requires application of modern science and technology blended with the rationale of indigenous practices. Various areas of focus for R and D are indicated to achieve this. Any progress in the suggested direction, however, will depend on the reorientation of agricultural research strategies to suit the specific requirements of these areas. This in turn is largely an institutional rather than a technological problem.||N. S. Jodha

The major women's issues of the time were abolition of child marriage, more humane treatment of widows and their right to remarry and education of women. The age of consent issue was integral to the child marriage question and the technical distinction between the two was often blurred in the actual controversy. The Consent Bill aimed to set a reasonable age limit below which a girl was considered to be incapable of giving consent to cohabitation and thus to ensure that her childhood was protected from physical coercion.

The industry is a heterogeneous one with the hardware segment accounting for nearly one-half of the aggregate sales turnover. This paper analyses the structure and behaviour of the hardware segment in a comparative perspective by taking the case of the Japanese industry. The dimensions of structure considered are: concentration ratios; level of integration; and economies of scale, while the behaviour of the industry is discussed in terms of (a) research intensity; (b) import intensity; (c) standardisation; and (d) skill development. The analysis shows that the structure of the industry has been by and large determined by government policies, which have been sub-optimal and which have ultimately resulted in the present none too healthy state of the industry.||B.

More specifically, it highlights the less appreciated aspect of a favourable turn-albeit from a very low level-in resource mobilisation effort of public sector enterprises in the 80s, reversing the declining trend of over a decade or so. The observed changes in the 80s appear to be significant enough to warrant a closer examination as to their causes, since they could have a bearing on the current debate on public sector policy reform.||R.

The East's entry into the world's free markets' appears to have ruinous ramifications for developing countries' trade. There are two circumstances which reinforce this conclusion. The first is the findings of the 1980s which show a firm trend of trade diversion that has already begun to flush out the developing countries not only from the markets of North, but also from its own markets. The second circumstance is the apparent tendency for the structure of intra-East Europe trade to be very similar to the export structures of the developing countries.||R G Nambiar,Rajesh Mehta,G A Tadas

These economic conditions are largely beyond anyone's control, but they have far-reaching effects on apparently autonomous political policies and social movements around the world. Uncontrollable world economic constraints and exigencies ironically subvert well and not so well intentioned political action all around the world. Their combination results in unhappy consequences for the peoples of the world. This thesis is illustrated here by examining the present transition from socialism to capitalism in the east, the underdevelopment of development in the south, the political economic conflicts among the western powers, and the tragic ironies in the Gulf War. Unfortunately, this kind of economic determinism/reductionism is not popular in any of these places; but, equally unfortunately, it is realistic for all of them.||Andre Gunder Frank

Interest rate and exchange rate policies, however sound, cannot improve by themselves the functioning of the system unless they form an integral part of such an institutional and policy framework. Section I of this paper deals with the indicators of financial development and the performance of the financial system with regard to mobilisation, allocation and efficient use of resources. The basic elements of an institutional and policy framework essential for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the financial system are indicated in Section II.

This paper presents an alternative scenario for Karnataka's electricity sector on the basis of the development-focused end-use-oriented (DEFENDUS) paradigm. The DEFENDUS scenario for energy demand and supply focuses on people-based development through the promotion of energy services, identifying technological opportunities for better utilisation of energy through a scrutiny of the end-uses of energy and adhering to a least-cost approach to the mix of energy supplies. Even though the DEFENDUS scenario involves the illumination of all homes in Karnataka, an emphasis on employment-generating industry, the energisation of all irrigation pumpsets up to the limit imposed by the groundwater potential and the establishment of decentralised rural energy centres in villages, it comes out with energy and power requirements in the year 2000 which are only about 38 per cent and 42 per cent respectively, of the LRPPP demand.

Some African countries turned to the Soviet Union and China for a different model of democracy, only to learn that in later years what existed in practice was yet another variant of dictatorship.

In addressing the larger question of what fascism does to gender this paper deals specifically with the image of women in Nazi ideology and whether this imagery underwent a change during the course of the second world war. It examines also the controversy surrounding the role of women in Hitler's rise to power and the voices of dissent.

But the east Europeans were hustled into choosing. They chose to be free. They have chosen galloping prices, steeply declining production, unemployment for 50 per cent of the workforce and social chaos. Here, in India, the shapers of our destiny are now being asked to be inspired by the example of the east Europeans.||A M

In such situations an episodic narration of encounters with respondents and the actions they carry out 'naturally' is a matter of anthropological reflexivity which an ethnographer should undertake in order to identify the impediments in the process of doing field work, to describe the strategies adopted for establishing relations with the people and, above all, to outline the process in which the self is comprehended in the background of the other. This paper is such a narrative reflection on field work in Baiga Chak in the Satpura region of Madhya Pradesh. [The first part of this paper appeared last week.]||Vinay Kumar Srivastava

Demographic forces should also be viewed in the context of-overall social development in concrete historical forms. Thus India's post-Independence demography, to be properly understood, must be studied in terms of the class structure and class relations not only of post-Independence India but also of the pre-Independence period under native and foreign economic and political powers. This paper attempts to interpret India's demographic regime in general and that of the agrarian population in particular in a historical perspective. The agrarian structure and population are examined on the premise of the salience of the social relations of production. The focus is on the historical emergence of the agrarian class in India and the accompanying processes of population change.||A Dharmalingam

Against this background this article analyses a novel written by a devadasi who broke away from the system and espoused the cause of women as a part of the early Dravidian Movement.

The economic subordination of the indigenous Palestinian working classes to the European capitalist economy formed only one aspect of the developing economic structure; the other aspect was the exclusion of the indigenous working classes from the dominant capitalist economy and the ruination of their 'natural' economy resulting in the expropriation of their lands. In addition the Zionist racist-nationalistic policies prevented them from. having access to their land even as wage labourers. It was this apparently contradictory relationship of exploitation/exclusion which characterised the Zionist colonial movement in Palestine.||Nahla Abdo

In order to explain wage movements in such an economy, the paper develops the concept of 'interrelated labour markets'. The paper is divided into four sections. The first section analyses the wage structure in agriculture and in construction activity both in the rural and urban sectors for those categories of labour that are paid daily wages. The validity of the concept of interrelated labour markets is verified by estimating vector autoregressions and testing for significant causal relations among the included wage rates. The second section develops a theory of wage structure in the context of interrelated labour markets which emphasises the importance of social norms in labour market behaviour. The third section examines movements in wage relativities in relation to changes in product demand. The final section develops analytical model to explain employment behaviour in interrelated labour markets and applies this model to explain the changes in employment and output in the agricultural sector of the Kerala economy.||T N Krishnan

However, there is an urgent need to lay greater emphasis on cost of producing unit quantity of water at the water point and charging economic water rates. Any financial scrutiny should also examine the percentage of net income per crop which can support the cost of purchasing water for its maturity. High capital cost schemes are unable to support even the water cost, let alone leave any surplus. Thus analysis of income based supportable irrigation water rates per crop is a must for project acceptability by financial institutions.||S. P. Sangal

Two recent World Bank reports have proposed programmes of economic expansion based mainly on the export of agricultural and mineral staples. This paper argues that such an approach can only deepen the crisis the continent is currently facing. It presents a case for an alternative people-related programme of development of which industrialisation will have to be a crucial component. At the core of this case is the premise that without manufacturing industries Africa's national economies cannot begin to effectively control and utilise their resources for meeting the needs of their populations. However, in order to develop indigenous manufacturing capabilities, African countries need access to technology which can be better achieved through South-South economic collaboration than through exclusive dependence on the OECD countries. Obstacles to this course of action lie mainly in the realm of politics.||Suranjit K. Saha

The new policy package, whose principal elements are market friendliness, privatisation and the opening up of the economy to foreign capital and trade, has been introduced ostensibly as a solution to the financial and balance of payments crisis that has resulted from following precisely these kind of policies in the last decade. This paper, through a detailed examination of different aspects of the proposed package, concludes that this package is likely to worsen the crisis, not remedy it.||H. K. Paranjape

Our primary focus in this paper will be on the macroeconomic adjustment policies embodied in the union budget, though we have also to consider the medium run macro implications of the exim policy, delicensing of industries and financial liberalisation. The fiscal management undertaken in the budget raises a number of important issues. First, how far is the finance ministry's perception—which incidentally is identical with that of the IMF—of the impact of fiscot parameters on macroeconomic variables correct? Second, assuming that the government's diagnosis of the ailing economy is sound, do the proposed steps constitute the right cure for correcting the macro imbalances? Finally, what are the implications and costs of the macroeconomic adjustment initiated by the government? Does the budget seek to minimise the burden of adjustment without sacrificing the basic short and long run objectives?||Mihir Rakshit

The application of the IMF's economic medicine has led to the compression of real earnings and the reinforcement of the cheap labour export economy: the same menu of budgetary austerity, trade liberalisation and privatisation is being applied simultaneously in more than 70 indebted countries in the third world and eastern Europe. Debtor nations forego economic sovereignty and control over fiscal and monetary policy, the central bank and the ministry of finance are reorganised, state institutions are undone and an economic tutelage is installed. A parallel government which bypasses civil society is established by the international financial institutions. Countries which do not conform to the IMF's performance targets are blacklisted.||Michel Chossudovsky

The reform has transferred 50 per cent of the total farm area to about 33 per cent of the rural families organised mostly under various form of co-operatives to preserve agricultural productivity while effecting an unequal pattern of rural income distribution. Consequently, the tenurial changes effected under the reform was only minimal although there occurred fundamental changes in tenancy and other agrarian relations with the elimination of all remaining vestiges of the feudal-like hacienda system. Although the reform failed to solve the problems of Iandiessness, it can be considered a notable success in modernising the agrarian sector so as to create the necessary conditions for autonomous industrial development like the creation of market-oriented and technologically responsive rural middle class, the transfer of agrarian capital into the industrial sector, and the conversion of former oligarchies and hacienda owners into industrial bourgeoisie by cutting their links with land.||R Maria Saleth

Rather, it involved moving from one form of capitalism, bureaucratic state capitalism, to another, the kind of multinational capitalism prevalent in the West. The 1970s and 1980s had seen a succession of economies in both North and South alike experience a painful and often bitterly contested process of restructuring as state sectors were thinned down or even dismantled in the hope of gaining better access to the new globalised structures of capitalism. As in the 1930s, the USSR was an extreme case of a general trend, then towards state capitalism, now towards multinational capitalism, not an aberration.||A T Callinicos

26/1/1991- ||review of political economy, january 1991||4397240||Towards an Indian Petty Bourgeoisie: Outline of an Approach||Study of historical Indian class formation has long been frustrated by the hostility of academic social science to class-based analyses, in part because caste is taken to be the sociology of India. Caste is only one among several historical socio-cultural institutions which must be de-essentialised and provided with context and contingency. This may be possible through an exploration of the rise of that most troublesome of all classes, the petty bourgeoisie. It is argued in this paper that such a class emerged in the midst of an eighteenth century historic advance of state and class institutions against rural and small-town communities, which had formed during India's medieval age. During the eighteenth century, localised societies became increasingly subjected to the twin forces of state-building and expanded and generalised commodity production. Moreover, during the late pre-colonial period, neither caste nor Hinduism nor Islam had yet been fixed and codified for use by colonial authorities. These 'traditional institutions' were undergoing profound changes from the impact of the same basic social forces that were giving rise to the modern classes of the sub-continent; caste, sect and class, as these are known now, were being formed simultaneously and interactively.||Burton Stein

These women stand out as pioneering in that they founded schools, dynamic in the way they administered and expanded them, and radical in the vision they had for their students. What makes the case of these women particularly interesting is that they were mostly widows. They rejected the familiar stereotypes for widows through their activism, but in subtle ways that retained for them the respect of society. Through the manipulation of symbols, they attained the position of 'devis'. Other women of the time, from before then, and right up to the present, who are active in education-and indeed in other areas of public life-have similarly found that functioning within certain norms that define 'purity', 'virtue', and 'austerity' enable them to go further in their professional work. Is this merely an instrumental technique of the most obvious kind, or do these highly motivated, enterprising women not share the same cultural fund of values as their society, and often deliberately choose to exploit the flexibility and contextuality inherent in a cultural tradition.||Nita Kumar

Although Sankaradeva's idea of establishing new society by putting an end to the caste and class distinctions made tremendous impact in Cooch Behar, it gradually lost its popular base. The rulers of Kamata-Cooch Behar gradually showed their inclination towards the orthodox Brahmanical faiths which always assign a special position to the ruling class. Apart from this there was the distinct erosion of economic base of the 'satras' of Cooch Behar as a result of greater involvement of outsiders like the Muslims, the Armenians and the Bhutanese in the big business transactions of the country. This, in turn, jeopardised the position of the local business community who had proved themselves to be the mainstay of neo-Vaishnavism.||P. K. Bhattacharyya

A variation of the same question is: Can an economy experience de-industrialisation when it runs an export surplus matched by a budgetary surplus, if its domestic investment profile is not lowered thereby and the size of the budget surplus does not have the effect per se of raising ex ante the level of domestic savings over what is required to finance domestic investment and the import surplus? The answer to both these questions suggested by standard macro-economics is in the negative. The purpose of this note is to argue against this proposition of standard macro-economics. There are situations, of which the colonial context according to radical and nationalist historians is one, where there is a shrinking of the overall level of activity, and consequent unemployment, despite the absence of an import surplus.||Prabhat Patnaik,Jayati Ghosh

This paper presents an alternative scenario for Karnataka's electricity sector on the basis of the development-focused end-use-oriented (DEFENDUS) paradigm. The DEFENDUS scenario for energy demand and supply focuses on people-based development through the promotion of energy services, identifying technological opportunities for better utilisation of energy through a scrutiny of the end-uses of energy and adhering to a least-cost approach to the mix of energy supplies. Even though the DEFENDUS scenario involves the illumination of all homes in Karnataka, an emphasis on employment-generating industry, the energisation of all irrigation pumpsets up to the limit imposed by the groundwater potential and the establishment of decentralised rural energy centres in villages, it comes out with energy and power requirements in the year 2000 which are only about 38 per cent and 42 per cent respectively, of the LRPPP demand.

The macro problems, that affect the entire population in a city, are of late receiving attention from academics and policy-makers. It has generally been held that the poor are not interested in resolving macro level problems of the environment. While this is certainly not true, it is a fact that micro level problems, such as access to water and sanitation are more immediate and specific problems for the urban poor. This paper attempts to examine the nature and magnitude of disparity in the access to water supply and sanitation of people in different levels of consumption expenditure in urban areas.||Amitabh Kundu

Owing to excessive emphasis on norms for minimum availability of vegetable oils to consumers, the edible oil policy, which has till recently been an amorphous medley of ad hoc administrative measures, has tilted more in favour of consumers and the vanaspati industry. This has happened on account of the existence of imports of oil as a soft option. The domestic production of oilseeds has consequently suffered on account of depressed prices. Production increases have occurred largely, because of shift of lands in favour of oilseeds crops, causing the possibility of creation of fodder deficits for dairying on one hand and neglect of overall balance in land use pattern on the other.||S.

Both the images and the discourses that invest them with their particular values are seen to have their origins in some critical breaks in techniques, perception and thought in colonial India. The study focuses on the specific historical conjuncture of the late 19th century, when the disjunction with 'tradition' and the encounter with 'modernity' assumed a sharp edge in all cultural representations, and the precursors of modern 'bazaar' images emerged as a dominant and standardised mass-art form.||Tapati Guha Thakurta

While the public sector needs reforms, the possibilities of substitution by the private sector are extremely limited given the stage and the structure of the economy. The strategy of their complementary roles in promoting the growth of the economy remains valid. While there is scope for improving the production function of both the sectors, the channels and instruments of increasing the role of the private sector in the non-agricultural sector need careful consideration if changes are not to lead to crises of growth and balance of payments.||Kalyan Raipuria,Rajesh Mehta

In theory a strong case can be made for economic planning and for varying degrees of government interference with market forces. But general theoretical arguments are of little or no value in indicating the role that a particular government can in practice play to promote economic development since they take no account of the institutional framework within which that role has to be played. A large number of socio-political factors combine to form the institutional framework of a country. The case of South Korea, examined in this paper, is one in which its socio-political conditions permitted a highly dirigiste economic regime to achieve impressive economic development during the period 1961-78.||Eprime Eshag

In the former category, this paper discusses: (a) the information gathering and processing, and risk assessment and management aspects of the financial system; (b) the insights of public choice theory into the difficulties of actually obtaining welfare enhancing policies from highly centralised economic systems and the related problems of rent-seeking behaviour associated with several types of government intervention in economic activities; and (c) the implications of openness and capital mobility for monetary and interest rate policies. In the category of new issues, this paper discusses: (a) increased interest in 'buffer stock' models of the demand for money; (b) the renewed debate over the most appropriate monetary anchor; and (c) the problems associated with the liberalisation of repressed financial systems.||Warren Coats,Deena Khatkhate

Together with the danger that in the totality of the revenue and expenditure proposals, we may not succeed in achieving the macroeconomic balance that is urgently necessary, the budget—in association with other economic policiesmay end up only imposing increased hardship on the common man, instead of restoring balance (and confidence) in the economy. What we need most urgently today is to make a serious effort to equate domestic saving with domestic investment, for which we need a two-pronged thrust: (a) a more purposive attack on the ' dissaving* by government administration by raising more taxes and by improving the functioning of government enterprises; and (b) an attempt to increase the savings of the community by stimulating ' local area planning' through devolution of both authority and finances.||Arun Ghosh

The authors then situate the recent economic policy changes in a broader context. They argue that the policies are contradictory in nature and are unlikely to result in the desired and anticipated changes in the economy. While the impact of these policies in the long run is not very clear, they are certain to adversely affect the poorer classes, both in rural and urban areas, in the short run. In an unequal society, the question of who tightens the belt is crucial.||Vinod Vyasulu,Sukhpal Singh,D Rajasekhar,Pooja Kaushik,A Indira

It is this dialectic of centralisation of the state and its erosion with which any agenda of change must wrestle, mere assertions of commitment to social justice, secularism and unity will not do. More important, we need to grasp the fact that a centralised state becomes increasingly dependent on vested interests, particularly money power but also other interests.

After almost half a century since the Bretton Woods Conference, another conference should now be organised to find the right path to structural adjustments.

Recent programmes in Bombay indicate the emergence of a perspective in public health policy which takes it beyond mortality control measures. This article is a contribution to the discussion of this emerging dimension of urban public health policy.

As a result the escalating misconduct of judges has often gone unpunished. Barring the extreme measure of impeachment, the law is silent, so much so that one might well say that the accountability of the judiciary is the vanishing point of jurisprudence. This void, unless competently covered by well thought-out legislation, is bound to undermine the democratic credibility of the judiciary.||V R Krishna Iyer

The present paper examines the historical experience and the alternative hypotheses about the pattern of trade in services. It focuses on a sector-specific study for certain major types of services (e g, engineering and construction, computer software, banking and insurance, technology services and other professional and consultancy services) to identify areas of mutual benefit between (and also within) the developing and the developed countries and the appropriate policy responses needed.||Alok Ray

This point of view supports industrial liberalisation, freer trade regimes and an exchange rate policy which aims to establish current-account convertibility of the rupee in the near future. These policies are supported not because equity does not matter but because it does. The equity objective emphasises a second set of desirable policies. These consist of direct public action for the poor. While such action is urged on a much larger scale than has been undertaken thus far, it should be direct in the sense that its market-distortionary effect is as small as possible.||Kaushik Basu

As the title of the paper indicates, we shall be concerned here basically with the economic content of socialism considered purely as a theoretical category. It should be emphasised that we are not concerned here with the (practical) policies Lenin pursued, before or after October 1917, towards the realisation of socialism. Ours is an exercise in pure theory. In what follows, Section I summarises Lenin's main ideas on socialism's economic content, Section II examines these ideas in the light of Marx's writings on the subject, while Section III concludes the paper.||Paresh Chattopadhyay

Thus US-USSR relations have been treated as essentially a 'great power' rivalry and the bloc conflict as one between two alliance structures associated with a bi-polar model of power equations on the world scale. This paper, contending with the 'realist' tradition, marks out the Russian Revolution of 1917 as its starting point and argues that the global schism between two irreconcilable socio-economic, political and value systems had four principal axes. Treating superpower relations as one of the axes the paper seeks to locate the evolution of US-USSR relations in a wider survey of overall global trends.||Achin Vanaik

From the semi-log trend fits, the supply of tea and demand for tea have been estimated for specified future years 1993, 1996 and 2001. The findings indicate that global demand for tea exceeds global supply of tea and this gap will increase over time, and as a result of which tea prices will rise. Country-wise phenomena reveal that some of the countries like Kenya, Sri Lanka and China are exporting tea at uneconomical prices possibly to meet their foreign exchange requirements. At the global level, there appears to be no relation between the annual tea export volume and its annual export price per kg. Added to this, there is sluggish growth in the area under cultivation of tea. Hence, global supply of tea may have to be increased by increasing the productivity of tea in order to meet both the domestic and export demands.||V. N. Reddy

It finds that while the film still carried some of the radical tendencies found in the early Dravidian Movement, it was a signboard of the coming days of the consensual politics the DMK was destined to play in Tamil Nadu.||M.

Paradoxically, while right-wing libertarian authors loudly proclaim the primacy of the societal rules of equality of opportunity and equality before the law, Marx on the face of it is in fact indifferent to the idea of equality and even dismissive of the goal of this 'bourgeois' notion. This seeming indifference however masks the case for perhaps the only genuine argument for true equality which is conceptualised as the abolition of all class distinctions, where the "enslaving subordination of the individual to the division of labour has vanished" and where "all the productive forces have also increased with the all-round development of the individual"||Pulin B.

While low commodity prices can be partly explained by sluggish demand due to slow growth in the industrialised countries, high interest rates and technological change, this does not seem a complete explanation. This paper examines the evidence in favour of the hypothesis that supply factors have partly been responsible. Many developing countries have faced severe balance of payments difficulties, in part due to the debt crisis, and have resorted to real exchange rate devaluations in order to boost export earnings. Such devaluations may have boosted export supplies, or prevented downward adjustments in capacity, and therefore put pressure on commodity prices. It also considers the policy implications of this externality, whereby attempts to boost export earnings in one primary producing country adversely affect the prices received by others.||V. Bhaskar

It is shown how investment in the information sector, and in information technology in particular, is productivity enhancing, resource saving, expands the country's production possibilities, improves the country's trading potentialities and contributes to a higher growth rate. Special mention is made of telecommunications in this regard. The size of the information sector is measured using the expenditure method. The classification of the information sector is somewhat different from the standard one due to the nature of the Indian economy. National accounts data and input output tables are used in the estimation. The results indicate that the size of the information sector in India is low, implying underinvestment in this sector and appropriate policy conclusions are drawn from it.||Vijay L Kelkar,Devendra N Chaturvedi,Madhav K Dar

Opting, on the other hand, for a policy that recommends a sharp reduction in the fiscal deficit through a cut in capital expenditures can push the economy into a recession immediately, affect future growth prospects and yet leave the balance of payments extremely vulnerable.||Abhijit Sen,C.

It is crucial therefore that distributional concerns are not lost sight of as part of the adjustment process.||Pulapre Balakrishnan

It is shown that the fundamental reason for deforestation is the prevailing system of property rights, which denies the local people certainty about future benefits from forests. This has destroyed the incentive to use forests sustainably. It is therefore suggested that the present structure of rights of use and control over forest lands be changed. Specifically, joint management of all but the inaccessible forests by van (i e, forest) panchayats and the forest department is proposed, with a division of powers between them that is designed to resolve the incentive problem.||E.

15/6/1991- ||special articles||4398093||Rushdie's Shame: Postmodernism, Migrancy and Representation of Women||The essential task of Third World novels, it is said, is to give appropriate form to the national experience and the range of questions that may be asked of these texts must predominantly refer to this experience. Consequently other kinds of questions have to be subordinated to the primacy of the authorised questions. It is with these other questions that the present essay is primarily concerned. Focusing more narrowly on the politics of reading individual texts the essay examines Salman Rushdie's book Shame. The author's purpose is to offer a symptomatic reading of an ideological location and in this context the essay locates the ideological underpinnings of Rushdie's work principally in the high culture of modernism and postmodernism.||Aijaz Ahmad

Countering such a tendency this paper, drawing on the Shiv Sena in Maharashtra and the situation in Punjab, sees the manifestation of ethnicity in Indian politics as a creation of vested interests. While repudiating the notion of full blown conspiracies the author argues that communal ideologies are hatched at the top and then broadcast below. Only sometimes do these take root and when they do not they merely languish as amorphous judgments, without concrete action prescriptions.||Dipankar Gupta

1/3/1991- ||the third dimension||4397429||Segmentation and Literacy||Did the segmentation of Indian society affect its patterns of literacy and learning in the pre-colonial period? This paper examines the question comparatively with medieval Europe. It argues that the segmentation of learning in India, and the associated sparsity of written narratives, acted convergently with other restrictions on experience. The range of viewpoints ordinarily available to an actor was thus curtailed; and this had consequences, too, for the quality of judgment-in the sense of judicious appraisal of threats and opportunities-in crucial areas.||Satish Saberwal

Instead we need to explore a different set of questions. First, the relation between patriarchies, the systemic violence which inheres in them, the consent they need to generate and social change. Second, if domestic ideologies are embedded in belief structures which so successfully efface their own history, then we need strategies wider than demystification to confront them. Third, the disproportion between the localised nature of the event and the enormous inflation of institutions, ideologies, beliefs which generate consent for the event raises questions about the relationship between patriarchies of different strata and wider ideological formations. That is, widow immolation is not only a question of patriarchies but other related structures which are either reproduced, changing or sought to be changed.||Sudesh Vaid,Kumkum Sangari

Mexico presents an interesting instance of a country which exploited this trend despite governmental opposition. This paper examines Mexico's trade performance in the light of the trends in world trade in the eighties and how this relates to the country's economic ties with the Unites States.||Nigel Harris

Section II of the paper provides a methodology for analysing the constraints on low yield districts. Data base and definitions of the variables are given in section III, while section IV describes the location and significance of the low yield districts. Section V analyses the constraints on agricultural productivity in the 100 low yield and some non-low yield districts and discusses the role of fertilisers and fixed capital in raising agricultural productivity. The last section presents the summary and conclusions.||S Mahendra Dev

This was also a period when because of the several factors, women's ideas and actual life situations were also undergoing change. However, confined to their homes, their strategies had to be played out in the context of patriarchal as well as colonial constraints; their rivalries reflected the internal contradictions of a patrilineal system that depended on them for survival and yet devalued them.||Bharati Ray
