An excessive concern with colonial state policy-particularly revenue policy-has given way to greater sensitivity to the regional and sub-regional context of agricultural growth. This essay is focused on one aspect of agricultural growth namely arable expansion in the Chotanagpur administrative division of Bihar between 1880 and 1950. Review of the evidence on arable expansion at the divisional and district level and examination of the relative importance of the causal variables related to demography, institutional structure and the market in influencing the course of agrarian expansion is set against the backdrop of the specific ecological and institutional milieu in which the changes took place.||Prabhu Prasad Mohapatra

It is essential for both ecological and public health considerations that pesticide usage be cut down to an absolute minimum and that innovative ways be introduced to limit or possibly eventually eliminate their use. At the same time, it must be recognised that there is a large industrial commitment to chemical pesticides, and that it might be necessary to turn chemical industries away from the production of so much pesticide and in the direction of more ecologically and socially beneficial products. Considering the number of accidents that have occurred in India because of the handling of extremely hazardous chemicals there is a strong case for such a change. A small beginning has been made to lessen the use of pesticides by the use of integrated pest management regimes. A great deal more is still needed.||Joan P Mencher

The macro problems, that affect the entire population in a city, are of late receiving attention from academics and policy-makers. It has generally been held that the poor are not interested in resolving macro level problems of the environment. While this is certainly not true, it is a fact that micro level problems, such as access to water and sanitation are more immediate and specific problems for the urban poor. This paper attempts to examine the nature and magnitude of disparity in the access to water supply and sanitation of people in different levels of consumption expenditure in urban areas.||Amitabh Kundu
31/8/1991- ||commentary||41498619||Pesticides: From Silent Spring to Indian Summer||The debate over pesticide use in India has been framed in a false dichotomy: prevention of human and environmental pesticide poisoning versus increased foodgrain production and control of insect-borne diseases. However, analysis of the effects of pesticides reveals that increasing pesticide use does not boost foodgrain production over the long term but, instead, has led to a resurgence of both target and secondary pests.||Aparna Viswanathan

It is the forest-dwellers, the tribals who have an age-old symbiotic relationship with forests who must participate in the process.||Victor Das

It is shown that the fundamental reason for deforestation is the prevailing system of property rights, which denies the local people certainty about future benefits from forests. This has destroyed the incentive to use forests sustainably. It is therefore suggested that the present structure of rights of use and control over forest lands be changed. Specifically, joint management of all but the inaccessible forests by van (i e, forest) panchayats and the forest department is proposed, with a division of powers between them that is designed to resolve the incentive problem.||E.
