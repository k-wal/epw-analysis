Although the mid-1980s drought was the harshest in living memory, foodgrain price stability and the widespread availability of consumption credit permitted villagers to maintain their consumption pattern of normal years. Still, the experience should not be catalogued as a complete success. Much of the unemployment endured by labourers, particularly women workers, could have been averted by a timely-and locally-available public works programme. The lack of water was probably the greatest constraint to the well-being of all villagers. When compounded by a severe shortage of electricity, the scarcity of readily available clean water led to a sizeable increase in water-related morbid symptoms in the second drought year: diarrhoea, eye infections, and scabies. Similarities and contrasts with other micro-studies of drought consequences are highlighted and implications are drawn for drought relief policy.||P D Bidinger,T S Walker,B Sarkar,A Ram Murthy,P Babu

An excessive concern with colonial state policy-particularly revenue policy-has given way to greater sensitivity to the regional and sub-regional context of agricultural growth. This essay is focused on one aspect of agricultural growth namely arable expansion in the Chotanagpur administrative division of Bihar between 1880 and 1950. Review of the evidence on arable expansion at the divisional and district level and examination of the relative importance of the causal variables related to demography, institutional structure and the market in influencing the course of agrarian expansion is set against the backdrop of the specific ecological and institutional milieu in which the changes took place.||Prabhu Prasad Mohapatra

This paper makes use of the Cost of Cultivation Reports of the government of Karnataka to analyse the growth potential of the new dryland technology and characteristics of market environment. The data and contextual evidence suggest that dryland agriculture in Karnataka is handicapped by a combination of three unfavourable factors: harsh physical conditions, inadequate and indifferent policies and competition from the more productive parts of agriculture. These factors are an adverse influence on the thrust for growth of the new dryland technology and on the market environment for dryland crops. More important, they appear to create attitudes among policy-makers not conducive to the evolution of a strategy based on development of conservation-oriented technology, use of local-and, often, degraded-resources and mobilisation of the people.||V.

It is essential for both ecological and public health considerations that pesticide usage be cut down to an absolute minimum and that innovative ways be introduced to limit or possibly eventually eliminate their use. At the same time, it must be recognised that there is a large industrial commitment to chemical pesticides, and that it might be necessary to turn chemical industries away from the production of so much pesticide and in the direction of more ecologically and socially beneficial products. Considering the number of accidents that have occurred in India because of the handling of extremely hazardous chemicals there is a strong case for such a change. A small beginning has been made to lessen the use of pesticides by the use of integrated pest management regimes. A great deal more is still needed.||Joan P Mencher

Sustainability, or rather survivability, in a situation of low pressure on resources was possible through traditional land extensive practices. In the changed circumstances with high pressure on fragile resources, the required high resource use intensity (for high productivity) with conservation is not possible through traditional measures. This requires application of modern science and technology blended with the rationale of indigenous practices. Various areas of focus for R and D are indicated to achieve this. Any progress in the suggested direction, however, will depend on the reorientation of agricultural research strategies to suit the specific requirements of these areas. This in turn is largely an institutional rather than a technological problem.||N. S. Jodha

This paper presents an alternative scenario for Karnataka's electricity sector on the basis of the development-focused end-use-oriented (DEFENDUS) paradigm. The DEFENDUS scenario for energy demand and supply focuses on people-based development through the promotion of energy services, identifying technological opportunities for better utilisation of energy through a scrutiny of the end-uses of energy and adhering to a least-cost approach to the mix of energy supplies. Even though the DEFENDUS scenario involves the illumination of all homes in Karnataka, an emphasis on employment-generating industry, the energisation of all irrigation pumpsets up to the limit imposed by the groundwater potential and the establishment of decentralised rural energy centres in villages, it comes out with energy and power requirements in the year 2000 which are only about 38 per cent and 42 per cent respectively, of the LRPPP demand.

However, there is an urgent need to lay greater emphasis on cost of producing unit quantity of water at the water point and charging economic water rates. Any financial scrutiny should also examine the percentage of net income per crop which can support the cost of purchasing water for its maturity. High capital cost schemes are unable to support even the water cost, let alone leave any surplus. Thus analysis of income based supportable irrigation water rates per crop is a must for project acceptability by financial institutions.||S. P. Sangal

14/9/1991- ||special articles||41627002||Micro Environment in Urban Planning: Access of Poor to Water Supply and Sanitation||Environmental degradation poses problems for urban populations both at the macro as well as micro levels. The macro problems, that affect the entire population in a city, are of late receiving attention from academics and policy-makers. It has generally been held that the poor are not interested in resolving macro level problems of the environment. While this is certainly not true, it is a fact that micro level problems, such as access to water and sanitation are more immediate and specific problems for the urban poor. This paper attempts to examine the nature and magnitude of disparity in the access to water supply and sanitation of people in different levels of consumption expenditure in urban areas.||Amitabh Kundu

It is shown that the fundamental reason for deforestation is the prevailing system of property rights, which denies the local people certainty about future benefits from forests. This has destroyed the incentive to use forests sustainably. It is therefore suggested that the present structure of rights of use and control over forest lands be changed. Specifically, joint management of all but the inaccessible forests by van (i e, forest) panchayats and the forest department is proposed, with a division of powers between them that is designed to resolve the incentive problem.||E.
