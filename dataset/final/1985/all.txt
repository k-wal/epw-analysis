13/4/1985- ||special articles||4374280||On Some Aspects of the Strategy of Growth in India||This paper identifies four major components of the strategy of growth that is taking shape in India under the new regime: (a) district-wise industrialisation; (b) modernisation and technological advancement that is prone to the Ricardo effect; (c) recourse to import as a device for instilling a competitive spirit; and (d) regeneration and optimal use of land resources. It argues the case for a State Public Sector to initiate small and medium scale industries. It suggests the criterion of 'forward-biased labour-intensity' to counter the Ricardo effect. It pleads for removal of barriers to the growth of small-scale entrepreneurs. Some 60 million hectares of land, equivalent to one-fifth of the total territory, or two-fifths of the net cropped area, is under pastures, culturable waste, fallow, and the like. Bulk of this land can be developed, within the limits of available technology, into farms or forests. Part of it may be mobilised to settle landless labourers. This paper gives a simple computable criterion for land allocation, under conditions of external economies of forests or similar ecological factors.||Ranjit Sau

It had appeared for some weeks before the Budget that private industry was confident about such a shift. The behaviour of the commodity and share markets did not show any pre-Budget nervousness and was in fact remarkably steady. While economists who were taking for granted that the public sector outlay in the Seventh Five Year Plan would be around Rs 1,80,000 crore (at 1984-85 prices) assumed that there would be strong measures for additional resource mobilisation right from 1985-86, the business world was banking on cuts in direct taxes and on wider incentives to private investment. It is this group which has anticipated everything correctly. The new government has been persuaded to adopt an Indianised variety of what used to be called 'supply-side economics' a few years ago.||Bhabatosh Datta

With the help of maps and poll statistics which bring out the significance of the ethnicity factor in the 1983 sanguinary elections, the authors conclude that although the voter turn-out was just half of what it was in the preceding 1978 Assembly poll for the state as a whole, there was normal to high polling in 40 per cent of the 105 constituencies where elections were contested and could be completed. These normal-to-high poll constituencies are, by and large, coterminous with seven of Assam's sixteen districts. The authors believe that the latest electoral rolls published recently did take care to eliminate suspected foreigners' names, as far as possible, without violating the Constitution and justice in the given tangled situation. To avoid another break-up of what is now Assam on an ethno-linguistic basis, the Assamese need for their self-preservation various guarantees other than the expulsion of pre-1971 settlers. This is one lesson that the Assamese public opinion is now increasingly adjusting itself to.||Keya Dasgupta,Amalendu Guha

For even if we altogether ignore what are commonly described as 'conventional' weapons and even if we forget all about the biological and chemical arsenals being expanded at present, the explosive power already congealed in the nuclear 'warheads' alone is sufficient to blow up the biosphere of the Earth many times over. What we need to, can and must try to comprehend is the essential logic of this situation. The intensification of the process of weaponisation means that each superpower establishment, using the other's programmes and pursuits as an excuse, extracts ever larger resources out of its own people. But at the same time, the two powers will be, and in fact will have no option but to be, seeking new modes of accommodation with each other. By the very nature of the weapons they have managed to acquire the two have been forced to enter into a state of a fateful and a potentially fatal collusion. Each is concerned with its own build-up as determined by the perceived domestic requirements of its own Establishment. In the circumstances, the contradiction must get crystallised. and also find expression, not between the blocs but within each bloc.||Narindar Singh

01/6/1985- ||special articles||4374473||Rural Non-Farm Sector in Asia: A Characterisation||There have been some attempts to collate the quantitative information on the size and structure of the rural non-farm sector. However, there have been few systematic attempts to characterise or analyse its role in the developmental process. In fact, a lot of the conflicting evidence and controversies that are found in the literature regarding the rural non-farm sector arises precisely because of the lack of a clear definition and of an analytical framework characterising its nature and place in the economic system. A large part of this confusion disappears if one analyses the components of the rural non-farm sector and realises that for all intents and purposes the sector has a rather sharply bimodal nature. The bifurcation is not so much along aggregated product lines, but more along production technology, linkage patterns and surplus generation. Much of the controversy regarding the nature and dynamics of rural non-farm activities can be resolved if one allows for their essential heterogeneity within the sector. An attempt is made here to characterise a prototype Asian rural economy when a rural non-farm sector with its bimodal character is embedded in the system.||Swapna Mukhopadhyay

20/7/1985- ||special articles||4374613||Import of Donated Commodities, Export of Feed, and New Technology of Milk Production||Operation Flood relies heavily on donated commodities. These donations make India the largest recipient of food aid from the EEC. The inflow of donated commodities is likely to have a contracting effect on the dairy sector of the Indian economy. India, on the other hand, is a major exporter of oilcake meals. A significantly large quantity of it is being exported to the EEC. The domestic supply of this protein meal is otherwise inelastic. This has serious implications for the cross-breeding technology of Operation Flood II, the success of which depends, to a large extent, on the availability of readily digestible sources of energy. The main argument of this paper is that the import of donated commodities and the export of oilcakes are bound to slow down the rate of expansion of the Indian dairy industry and a continuation of such a policy would weaken the position of the Indian farmers vis-a-vis the European farmers.||Surendar Singh,Kamaljit Singh

14/9/1985- ||special articles||4374822||New Import and Export Policy: Some Economic Implications||There is a similarity of purpose between the government's new economic policy and the new trade policy: both are guided by a spirit of liberalisation of existing restrictions on economic activities of the private sector. Apart from their revenue effect, some of the measures of liberalisation have important long-run resource allocation implications. In examining this aspect of the new trade policy, the author sees a basic difference between the decision to permit import of numerous special-purpose machinery under the OGL and that of allowing technology imports, imports of computer systems and imports of spare parts of electronic goods on a large scale. A possible long-run effect of the latter set of measures, the author argues, may be that around a few giant firms producing assembled products with foreign collaboration, a large ancillary sector will be created for supplying components produced on purely imitative lines. This may increase export opportunities, but the allocation of resources in the long-run would have little relation with our Plan goals and priorities or even resource endowment including the pool of skilled manpower. In particular, considerations of full utilisation of labour and development of indigenous technological capability will henceforth play second fiddle to the objective of setting up a modernised and outward looking production system, however narrow the base of the system may be.||Susmita Rakshit

An attempt is made to identify the gaps in our existing studies where future research efforts may be oriented. The paper begins by setting out an approach to the analysis of data on infant mortality. Following that the national and the state level estimates of neonatal, postneonatal and overall infant mortality by sex and rural-urban residence are reviewed. Attention is then focused on the available evidence on the contribution of various prenatal, natal and postnatal factors to infant mortality during different time period. This approach is adopted to help identify and assess the possible role of different intervention programmes. [This is the third and final part of the paper. The first two parts appeared in the last two issues.]||Leela Visaria

14/12/1985- ||special articles||4375119||Poverty and Agricultural Development||The author's analysis of data on agricultural development and the proportion of the rural population below the poverty line suggests that the adoption of the water-fertiliser-HYV technology has led to a decline in poverty. The decline is also associated with increase in agricultural and foodgrains production. If the decline in the proportion of the poor in rural India has been relatively small, it is not because the 'trickle down modified' thesis is not valid in the Indian situation, but because the rate of agricultural growth has been low and has been heavily dependent on the vagaries of nature. Against this background, the author argues that land reform in the sense of 'land to the tiller' is the one measure that is needed for an enduring solution of the problem of rural poverty. Land reform is needed to break the power of the rural oligarchy and initiate the process of rapid agricultural and rural development. The other solution lies in providing water management, fertiliser, HYV seed, credit and extension service in a big way, free from bureaucratic red-tape, for rapid agricultural development. On the other hand, the 'target group oriented schemes' approach to poverty alleviation, which is essentially an euphemism for charity and distribution of doles, furthers the imperialist attempt to increase the stranglehold of bureaucratic and semi-feudal structures on the Indian economy and to erode the resources needed for accumulation and development of technology. This approach also suits the rural oligarchy and bureaucracy.||Pradhan H. Prasad

While the position of working capital management showed some improvement between 1975-79 and 1979-83, industries have not succeeded in widening the base of long-term funds to the desired extent.||V.

The accuracy of national level statistics, which usually serve as the principal data input in the framing of development policies, is severely impaired by biases which lead to an undercounting of women, both as workers and as those available for work. This paper seeks to spell out the nature and sources of these data biases and attempts to provide pointers on how they could be corrected and some of the data gaps filled.||Bina Agarwal

The paper is organised into three sections. The first section deals with the past and the more recent history until the pre-independence era and the initiation of the Indo-Norwegian Project in 1952. This part attempts to portray the overall context and concerns of fisheries development initiatives in Kerala and in the country as a whole. It also provides the background to the dynamics of the establishment of the Indo-Norwegian Project. The second part deals with over three decades of planned fisheries development in Kerala-1950 to 1982-showing the changing approaches to development and the consequences emanating therefrom. It evaluates state policy, the efforts of the Norwegians, the role of the private sector and the larger socio-economic forces in transforming the fish economy and the effects of this on fish workers and fish. The final part of the paper deals with the present crisis in Kerala's fish economy and highlights the questions being raised about it-including the very pointed one about the extent of Norwegian responsibility for the present state of affairs.||John Kurien

24/8/1985- ||special articles||4374745||'Rational Choice' Marxism: Some Issues of Method and Substance||In seeking to provide micro-foundations for behaviour which Marxists think are characteristic of capitalism, the tools par excellence are rational choice models: general equilibrium theory, game theory, and the arsenal of modelling techniques developed by neoclassical economics. With rational choice models, Marxian economics has made a good deal of progress in explaining mechanisms which lie behind otherwise apparently teleological claims. The author outlines an agenda which 'rational choice' Marxism can set in order to answer two important questions which challenge its methodological premises. In rational choice Marxism (1) where is there room for class struggle? and (2) where is there room for the social formation of ideas, for the formation of the individual by society?||John E. Roemer

22/6/1985-29/6/1985||special articles||4374537||Social History: Predicaments and Possibilities||Research on modern Indian social history, here or abroad, cuts a sorry figure. A considerable gap remains between our understanding of the basic structures and tendencies of the colonial economy and the much-explored history of political movements in late colonial India. This area of silence relates to the vast and virtually unexplored terrain of forms of popular consciousness and culture. The gap is related to lack of fruitful dialogue between history, sociology and social anthropology. The failure of grapple seriously with problems of consciousness and culture leads repeatedly to inadequate or even trite explanations, in particular the two related poles of economic reductionism and mobilisation by great leaders/ideologies or skilful manipulators of patron-client linkages. There is need to move towards both 'a materialist and relational concept of culture' and 'a more culturally embedded analysis of the material world'. A social history developing through a fruitful, because critical, dialogue with anthropology can help "in locating new problems, in seeing old problems in new ways, in an emphasis upon norms and value systems and upon rituals, in attention to expressive functions of forms of riot and disturbance, and upon symbolic expressions of authority, control and hegemony".||Sumit Sarkar

Thus farmers in the irrigated areas are likely to be more responsive to an economic incentive than their counterparts in the unirrigated areas in terms of crop pattern shifts and in their endeavours to raise yield per hectare. This paper attempts to examine the impact of irrigation on farmers' acreage response behaviour to changes in output prices. District-wise data from Andhra Pradesh are used for the period 1955-56 to 1972-73.||Hrushikesh Panda

Recent 'objective' crop acreage estimates, and land use analysis based upon aerial photography, indicate that as much as one million acres of crop land may be missing from the country's official agricultural statistics. Current annual rice output may be underestimated by 400,000 metric tonnes or more. Whereas agricultural output growth rates estimated from official data indicate a decline from 2.15 per cent per annum in the period 1949-64 to 1.52 per cent in the period 1965-80, the revised series reveals an opposite movement: output growth rose from an estimated 1.27 per cent in the earlier period to 2.18 per cent in the latter. Such output underestimation does not, however, imply that the magnitude of hunger in Bangaldesh is any less severe than reported in past studies. Rather, the present study suggests that widespread malnutrition, incidence of which is determined in large part by the distribution of income and hence of food, has occurred within a context of higher national agricultural output than is recorded in the official figures.||James K.

One recent instance of superpower collaboration can be found in their common and forceful insistence, during the Third UN Conference on the Law of the Sea, on an overly liberal regime of passage through straits used for international navigation. They have substantially succeeded in incorporating in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provisions as to passage through straits which are regarded as being conducive to their security interests.||Shekhar Ghosh
31/8/1985- ||review of management, august 1985||4374768||Cost of Technology Imports: The Indian Experience||Though acquisition of technology from abroad may at times prove to be an expeditious way of getting the requisite technology, it has inevitable short and long run implications for the economic and technological development of the borrowing country. A significant amount of literature has directed itself to assessing the impact of technology imports by India. Most of the studies in this category are, however, partial in their scope in that they have studied the impact in specific cases or on some specific parameters. This paper summarises the current state of knowledge on this aspect. The author deals first with the direct costs of import of technology and later with its indirect impact on the economy through its implications for balance of payments, the technological environment, industry structure, equity, etc. While doing so, significant studies made for other developing countries are kept in the background so as to provide comparison.||Nagesh Kumar

Since then, the scheme has been extended to more areas of more states. The purpose of this paper is to trace the methodological modifications made from time to time in the original scheme, to identify certain outstanding problems and to suggest provisional solutions.||V.

20/4/1985- ||special articles||4374314||Fiscal Strategy Left Incomplete||Government, it is clear from the 1985-86 Budget, has declared its inability to reduce normal recurring expenditure and a regime of high revenue deficits has, therefore, come to stay. As there is no likelihood of growth of revenue from direct taxes, the only possibilities left are improvement in working of public sector undertakings and growth of indirect tax revenues. But unless the structure of indirect taxes is reformed, the cascading effect leading to increases in costs and prices is unavoidable. The general rate of profitability in the private sector is low and returns on borrowed funds are considerably higher than those on owned funds and they may shrink further because of more competitive conditions that may be created following the changes in industrial policy and in direct taxes. Unless, therefore, prices of industrial products move up or, in other words, there is inflation, the incidence of industrial sickness will grow. Achieving growth with relative stability will become a progressively unrealistic objective. If reduction in costs and prices can be brought about only through upgradation of technology and innovation and reducing wastage in the use of manpower and other resources, it will be fruitful to address ourselves more seriously to these tasks.||M.

This is particularly the case in many Third World urban contexts where female labour force participation rates have been traditionally low until the recent emergence of opportunities for women in 'new' gender-segregated industries, such as electronics assembly, for instance. The empirical starting point for this study was the observed increase in the participation of women in the Calcutta labour force, due to a combination of high male unemployment, falling urban living standards and some increase in employment of a semi- or unskilled kind for which women workers are positively preferred. This preliminary account concentrates mainly on changes in the domestic division of labour and on the distribution and disposal of women's wages. The major emphasis will be on the importance both of the class position of the household and of the cross-cutting effects of the household developmental cycle in understanding the varying effects which women's employment may have.||Hilary Standing,Bela Bandyopadhyaya

Such calculations enable a study of the effect of inflation and other allowances like depreciation, investment allowance, etc, on incentive to invest. The results show that the effective tax rates increase with inflation but at a decreasing rate. Secondly, inflation increases the dispersion in the effective tax rates causing the tax system to become more non-neutral. A tax system is then suggested which is neutral and compensates for the price increases.||Poonam Gupta,Sanjeev Gupta

This patchwork of disjointed, disparate programmes with no set goals and motivated by short-term considerations do not add up to a coherent and consistent national policy. In the absence of a well-conceived, comprehensive, national policy for the eradication of widespread undernutrition among the children of the country, we have allowed ourselves to be wafted and tossed about by passing winds and fashions of the moment. We have not yet put on the ground a health infrastructure which effectively reaches even 20 per cent of the population. Available health technology for prevention and control of such major nutritional diseases as goitre, nutritional blindness and iron-deficiency anaemia is not being effectively utilised. We have no major programme for support to undernourished mothers and for promotion of their health and nutrition.||C. Gopalan
27/4/1985- ||review of women studies, april 1985||4374336||Changing Consciousness of Central American Women||Recent years have witnessed an awakening of women's consciousness in Latin America as a whole, and a burgeoning of multiform activities arising out of, and responding to, their specific, daily, concrete experiences-in the home, but also in the workplace, educational institutions, trade unions, political parties, and guerilla movements. The old refrain, 'there can be no women's liberation without socialism', has been revised to 'socialism is a necessary but not sufficient condition for women's liberation'. The linear conception of priorities among struggles has been replaced by a more dialectical one of interaction among all struggles against oppression and exploitation, with consequent mutual enrichment and strengthening. Lessons have been learned from some of the liberation movements and democratic struggles of the sixties and seventies. Latin American women have also examined the problems that are still arising in revolutionary Cuba, where women's transformation as a social sector has been hampered not only by material constraints, but also by the legacy of tenacious patriarchal attitudes. Drawing on such experiences as these, as well as their own, the women of Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador are adding their own issues as women qua women to the agendas of their countries' revolutionary movements. How these issues make their appearances varies somewhat from country to country, and is discussed in this paper.||Bobbye Suckle Ortiz

The first section of the paper discusses handloom weaving in Bangladesh in general and the situation in the research area. Then the downward mobility among the weavers of the research village is described. A detailed analysis of the handloom way of production follows in Section III. The organisations and politics among the weavers of Tantigram are discussed in Section IV. Section V analyses the nature of indigenous yarn production and distribution of cotton yarn. The conclusions of the study are set out in the final section. [This is the concluding part of the paper which is being published in two parts.

Even where there is a fairly rigorous market for agricultural labour, particularly for seasonal operations, the operation of this market sometimes does not extend very strongly beyond the confines of the village or beyond some local neighbourhoods. This paper reports the results of a survey of five clusters of neighbouring villages carried out in West Bengal in 1981-82. The authors find some significant, though varying, evidence of territorial segmentation of the rural labour market and of limited labour mobility even within adjacent territories.||Pranab Bardhan,Ashok Rudra

Part I of the study, based on the Reserve Bank of India's sample survey of small scale industrial units conducted during 1976-77, discusses the broad trends in the growth in number of small enterprises and some characteristics of the structure of this sector. In Part II, using the National Small Industries Corporation sample survey data for 1979, some other aspects of the small scale sector like marketing of output, availability of inputs, nature of competition, pricing, etc, are discussed.

We have tried to understand just how girls brought up in the villages and brought abruptly to Bombay at the time of their marriage (sometimes a few years before, more typically a relatively short time after) adapt to urban ways. We have enquired into the ways in which living in the city, in physical conditions quite different from those to which they are accustomed in the countryside, speaking other languages, have influenced their behaviour and their ideas. In the first phase of the study, some of the results of which are reported here, we took a sample of working-class households in both chawls and slums. This procedure enabled us: (1) to gather information about a considerable number of women in respect of mother-tongue, place of birth, length of stay in Bombay, jati, age, position in the family, education, degree of labour-force participation, and type of gainful activity if any, so that we could select a representative fraction for more intensive interviewing; (2) to obtain comparable data on the men and children in the same families; (3) to observe daily life in the chawls and zopadpattis which serve as the setting within which our subjects spend the greater part of their existence, and by the unwritten codes of which their comportment is governed.||Alice Thorner,Jyoti Ranadive

Further, the Centre-State flows have not been equitable and this has been truer the greater the discretion enjoyed by the Centre in regard to transfers. From the point of equity, therefore, the discretionary component of Centre-State financial flows must be curbed. Even with respect to non-discretionary transfers equity will need to be observed as the over-riding consideration in their inter-state allocation. The states as a group have to be assured of an adequate share of Central resources, access to which they can gain in a manner that is not susceptible to discretionary considerations and pressures from the Centre. Were the Planning Commission to be so constituted as to inspire the confidence of the states, the task of sharing of resources between the Centre and the states and among states could be entrusted to it.||K.

It has, however, an extremely high inflationary potential. It is also likely to worsen income distribution. This has been widely hailed as a 'bold' Budget, presumably because it gives large concessions. But that is precisely what this Budget is not because it does not require any boldness to give concessions to the rich and powerful. Where the Budget saves is in its allocation for rural employment programmes and other Plan items. This paper analyses the implications of these new fiscal policies.||Kaushik Basu

We can distinguish between those without land and those with it, and among the latter between those with marginal, small, medium and large holdings. Along with these class interests, we can demarcate various castes, groups that are differentiated ritually, occupationally and/or socially. The author analyses the 'white revolution' into its component facets of production, procurement, marketing and consumption in order to inquire about each of these components. First, which rural classes/castes benefit from the production strategy of Operation Flood that revolves around crossbred cows fed on green fodder and compounded feed? Second, which classes/castes in rural India find Operation Flood's procurement network of Anand pattern dairy co-operatives advantageous? Third, what is the impact on various village classes/castes of marketing through Operation Flood's milk grid? Finally, which rural classes/castes gain in terms of milk consumption from the 'white revolution'?||Shanti George

Gandhi's ideas about women and their role in public life was a departure from those of the 19th century reformers. He saw women as a potential force in the struggle to build a new social order. He consciously attempted to articulate connections between private and public life in order to bring women into the struggle. However, he failed to come to terms with the fact that oppression is not a moral condition but a social and historical experience relating to production relations. On the other hand even while insisting that a woman's real sphere of activity was the home, he was instrumental in creating conditions which could help women break the shackles of domesticity. [The first two parts of the article which deal with Gandhi's views on the nature of women's oppression and the influence his ideas had in drawing women into the freedom movement are published in this issue. The third part, which reviews his personal relationships with women will appear next week.]||Madhu Kishwar

Care should be taken to ensure that the concessional import tariffs with respect to automobile ancillary items and spares do not pose a threat to the domestic automobile ancillary industries. Secondly, the definition of project imports now applies only to establishment of a new unit or a substantial capacity expansion and is unlikely to be helpful to automobile ancillary units which have already attained a certain degree of skill and productive capacity. For them marginal expansion or technological upgradation may be sufficient, but they may be baulked by the high tariffs on imported raw materials and capital goods not falling within the scope of project imports. Finally, the policy of reservation of certain automobile ancillary items for the small-scale sector needs to be modified and the criteria for reservation should be based on considerations of scale of production and technology.||T.

Further, the author briefly outlines the reasons for this bias and tries to point out its economic basis. Finally, the effect of underutilising electric and diesel tubewells on the cost and efficiency of irrigation is briefly discussed.||Jasveen Jairath

These are all indicative of a significant change in the perceptions of the policy-makers regarding the mainsprings of the Indian growth process. This paper attempts to examine these changed perceptions in the context of the long-term implications of the policy initiatives in the Budget for the Seventh Plan. Second, it seeks to assess the short-term price consequences of the Budget proposals.||K. Sundaram,Suresh D. Tendulkar,K. Krishnamurty

It focuses on certain issues such as that of mobilisation, initiative and ideology behind the strike and seeks to analyse the role of outside labour leaders in organising and conducting the political actions of the workers. Finally, after discussing the specificity of the strike, the author places it in the context of certain general problems regarding the history of the working class in India recently explored in some research papers. The paper, in addition, makes some comments on certain issues such as the effect of rationalisation on labour, the pattern of external interventiion including communist penetration, working class solidarity, trade union consciousness, etc, in the Fort Gloster mills in comparison with developments in other areas of the country.||Amal Das

Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh is regarded as one of the leading areas in regard to commercialisation of agriculture. The district is well known for tobacco and chillies. After the advent of the Nagarjuna Sagar waters in 1968-69, it has gained a distinct place in the country's cotton map on account of its significant contribution to the production of import-substituting superior long and extra-long staple cottons like MCU-5, Varalaxmi and Suvin. The cultivation of these varieties of cotton requires substantial monetary outlays as well as careful application of techniques like crop rotation, preparatory tillage, etc, for better yields. During the period 1970-71 to 1979-80, there has been a four-fold increase in the average value per hectare from the cotton crop in Guntur district. Against this background, this study focuses on (i) agricultural changes in Guntur district from the beginning of this century, (ii) factors responsible for the shift of cropping pattern towards cotton as against other commercial crops as well as foodgrain crops, (iii) profitability of cotton cultivation across different socio-economic classes, and, (iv) the marketing channels for cotton and seasonality in prices of cotton.||V.

This paper reports the results of a study of land market competition amongst peasant farms of Sangrur district of Punjab, categorised into three groups: growing, decaying and static. By comparing the characteristics of farms belonging to these three categories, it is possible to identify the factors that enable some peasant farms to gain land via the market and compel others to lose it through land sales.||H.

Section I points out the difference between the industrial structure of India and that of its major technology suppliers, and the patterns of supply and demand for technology which also differ as a result. Section II distinguishes the market structures of Indian industries, and relates them to technology supply from abroad, R and D and appropriability of technology. Section III describes how these market structures have evolved since the fifties. Section IV shows the influence of technology imports on the market structures and the dominant types of firms. Section V suggests a relationship between industrial performance and conditions of supply of technology. In Section VI the author deals with fellow-researchers' findings on those conditions of technology supply. Section VII compares some of the aims of technology import policies with their consequences. Finally, section VIII lists some of the policy changes suggested by the findings.||Ashok V. Desai

14/12/1985- ||special articles||4375118||Women's Work, Welfare and Status: Forces of Tradition and Change in India||The first three Sections of this paper are about how work is structured in relation to poverty and hierarchy: the differentials in quantity and quality of work participation; the inequalities in work options, in remuneration, in access to the means and opportunities for better work; and in the organised bargaining capacity to change the terms of existing employment. The central question is how patriarchy combines with the caste-and-class hierarchy to sustain the segmentation of the labour market and the inequities in access to the means and resources for work. Section IV takes up the issue of whether and how differentials in work participation affect other aspects of women's status and welfare, the quality of female life. The aspects that so far have been studied most are the oppressiveness of dowry, the preference for sons and the nurturance deprivation of the female infant and child. The question is whether, across communities and regions, these have any relationship with the degree of women's participation in economically productive work. The sheer durability of gender inequity-in work and remuneration, in options and opportunities, in power and control-brings up questions about the underlying mechanisms for containment of conflict, the processes of internalisation, manipulation and subterfuge, which are not entirely one way. Yet, the fact that women's struggles keep rising, phoenix-like from the ashes, makes one look also at the processes of mobilisation and catalysis, the alliances and the divisions of women. Section V reviews some of these issues. [This paper is being published in two parts. The first three Sections are printed below and Sections IV and V will appear next week.]||Kalpana Bardhan

1/11/1985- ||foreign technology suppliers' view of indian industry||4375023||Exporting Industrial Technology to India: Strategies and Experiences of Swedish Firms||The rationale for Indian policies restricting technology imports has been threefold: (i) reducing the costs of imported technology while assuming an 'inelastic' supply in international technology markets; (ii) 'protection' of domestic R and D activities on 'infant industry' grounds; and (iii) reducing the strain on balance-of-payments from technology payments. The findings of this paper point to the need for greater selectivity in the application of direct controls in restricting technology imports. In industries with closely held technologies, increased use of bargaining on a case-by-case basis, based on a joint government-industry position, is called for. In competitive industries, there is no rationale altogether for directly controlling technology imports. Measures of direct control are instead likely to raise the foreign firm's transaction-specific costs thus reducing the available supply of technology for a given level of payments.||Gunnar Paulsson

However, there is considerable conceptual confusion about these terms which helps neither entrepreneurial research nor the programmes for entrepreneurial development. The paper seeks to clarify this confusion of concepts by examining the historical evolution of the term and the changes in its conceptual meaning. Based on this analysis the author presents a schema for understanding the process of entrepreneurship. The author concludes that although entrepreneurship must remain confined to the economic sphere it cannot be comprehended without reference to factors other than the economic alone.||Dwijendra Tripathi

Without disputing this approach, this article seeks to redress the balance of concern, and to caution against a too generalised interpretation of emerging trends. For in some of the large and growing cities at least, the mortality pendulum seems to be swinging away from intestinal towards respiratory diseases; however, the causes of this change are not as clear-cut as the current interest in air pollution might suggest.||Radhika Ramasubban,Nigel Crook

This appears to be very significant not only in itself but also for our understanding of industrial change in India. The analysis in this paper, though very tentative, suggests that the relationship between capital intensity, profit rate and size seems to have undergone a considerable change compared to what Ishikawa had observed over two decades ago. Following his reasoning the observed changes seem to suggest that some of the institutional constraints which were responsible for the predominance of large sized factories in the fifties have, at least to a certain extent, been overcome in the subsequent period. The author's findings also appear to question some of the accepted dictums regarding the association between size, capital intensity and efficiency.||R. Nagaraj

Now, the question of skill/lack of skill or efficiency/inefficiency of Indian labour involves both theoretical and empirical considerations. None of the accounts of the early Indian industrial worker, however, bases its arguments on a clear theoretical position. At the same time, a critical enquiry into the TISCO workers' performance calls into question also the empirical validity of this view of Indian labour. This paper is in two parts. In the first part, attempts are made to problematise certain theoretical issues. Apart from showing the theoretical inadequacies of the established view of Indian labour, the author focuses on the discussion around the theme of skill/efficiency. In the second part of the paper, the empirical fallacies in the established view of the Indian worker are taken up. The author discusses how in this view illiteracy and the alleged low level of skill of the Indian worker are seen as interdependent. Also taken up for consideration are the ideological motivations that shaped the established view of labour as well as the question of the comparative efficiency of Indian and Western labour.||Satyabrata Datta

28/9/1985- ||review of agriculture, september 1985||4374870||Irrigation Impact on Farm Economy||The main conclusion, emerging from a limited probe into the sample field data of four states of Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, is that the on-farm benefits from a unit of irrigated area need not rise with the size of a farm holding. Small farmers can gain, acre for acre, as much benefits from irrigation as do large farmers. This is borne out by survey data pertaining to Punjab and Tamil Nadu states. This result is traceable to some sort of equality attained by farmers in the use of chemical fertilisers which are a major source of increasing crop yield in modern agriculture. In the absence of this equality in fertiliser use, as observed in the case of the Maharashtra and UP surveys, benefits from each unit of irrigated area are positively associated with farm size. This raises two questions: (1) why small farmers fail to step up fertiliser application in the wake of irrigation to the same extent as do the larger farmers, and (2) what may be the policy instruments for ensuring equality in gains from irrigation between small and larger farmers.||B.

It has pointed out serious weaknesses in policies and their execution. It has also brought to the fore the ugly truth as to how little premium we place on human life-specially of those who do not belong to the privileged class. The last word on the Bhopal tragedy has not been written, nor will it be written for long. The epilogue might be longer than the drama. It is incredible that with our infrastructure, we still do not have a complete list of all those who died as a result of the Bhopal tragedy. The estimates vary from less than 1,500 (the official figures) to 30,000 (unofficial figures). What is particularly tragic is the lack of information from those who have it, or should have had it. One would have like to see an objectively written, comprehensive, reliable and authentic white paper on the tragedy. It is not the lack of expertise but the lack of a culture of concern, of thoroughness, of efficiency, all round, which generates such tragedies-and then sustains them, instead of ameliorating them, through time. The blame does not lie entirely with anyone in particular, but with the system that sustains instead of closing the schism between the privileged and the unprivileged that has been, and continues to be, the bane of our society.||Pushpa M.

It is hpyothesised that a company with too high or too low a turnover in the board of directors is not likely to be as high a performer as a company with a board having moderate ranges of turnover. It is felt that the lower stability does not permit continuity of policies which, in turn, affects organisational functioning. At the same time, it is also felt that too sticky boards are likely to become stale developing patterned ways of decision-making to arrive at habitual consensus wherein difference of opinion is not a virtue and the board remains insulated from new knowledge and ideas. Our effort in this article will be to measure the changes in the boards of directors of non-government public limited companies engaged in manufacturing and belonging to different categories of entrepreneurs and link the performance of their companies with these changes. The results of this study will reflect upon behaviours of various categories of entrepreneurs and provide lessons to potential entrepreneurs.||R. A. Sharma
02/3/1985- ||special articles||4374136||Transnational Corporations and Services: The Final Frontier||Services already account for almost two-thirds of world GDP and have also become prominent in golbal markets. The main beneficiaries of the international services trade have been a few developed market economies and a small number of large TNCs. The latter are the driving force behind this internationalisation, contributing to an accelerated liquidation of medium and small-scale firms that traditionally dominated the field. No less rapid have been the disintegration of barriers between individual service sectors and the rise of transnational service conglomerates and transnational integral conglomerates. When the TNCs attained dominance, which happened at different times and in varying degrees of intensity in different sectors, it was US and Japanese corporations that were in the lead. TNCs from these two countries exercise a far more pervasive control over services in the world market than they do over agriculture, mining and manufacturing. TNCs are at present impelling the service factor forward at a faster pace than any other sector. The expansion of services has also been accompanied by a serious decline in corporate accountability, due to service companies' access to tax-havens, flags of convenience, bank secrecy laws and a large array of legal and illegal arrangements.

30/11/1985- ||review of management, november 1985||4375055||Quality of Working Life: Some Issues in the Indian Context||The paper argues that the concept of quality of working life is much more broad-based than what its promoters in India have tended to project. The concept encompasses within itself not only better designed jobs but also several other inter-related elements. Any attempt to improve quality of working life that overlooks this basic fact is bound to fail. The paper also argues that the question of improving the quality of working life in developing countries like India would have to be considered not in relation to only some selective aspects of the development process such as the type of technology or work organisation used but in relation to the entire strategy of development of these countries. The paper is divided into four sections. The first three sections discuss the meaning of the concept of quality of working life, the factors that gave rise to it in the post-industrial phase of the Western capitalist countries and also the arguments that have been advanced in favour of improving the quality of working life in developing countries particularly through work-redesign. The final section of the paper reviews the results of the experiments on work redesign in India and discusses the reasons for their failure.||Anil K. Sengupta

Unlike other parts, agriculture could develop here only as specially adapted varieties suited to the characteristic natural condition. Besides, the beginning of agriculture date back to several millenia. The water-management techniques therefore, had the opportunity to be perfected over time. Unfamiliar with the natural conditions and adaptation process different from their own, the Western world could make only halting progress in understanding these traditional techniques. At every stage however, the limited wisdom was pampered as the 'modern' and scientific; the more complex traditional aspects regarded as unscientific and backward. The result is that even now the merits of these traditional systems await discovery and recognition towards enrichment of modern natural resource management techniques. But the political and cultural domination is anything but congenial to such scientific progress.||Nirmal Sengupta

Part I of the study, based on the Reserve Bank of India's sample survey of small scale industrial units conducted during 1976-77, discusses the broad trends in the growth in number of small enterprises and some characteristics of the structure of this sector. In Part II, using the National Small Industries Corporation sample survey data for 1979, some other aspects of the small scale sector like marketing of output, availability of inputs, nature of competition, pricing, etc, are discussed.

09/3/1985- ||special articles||4374157||Capital Goods Sector in India: Past and Present Trends and Future Prospects||This paper attempts an analysis of the roles played by the three major sub-sectors of the capital goods sector-machine tools, electrical equipment and chemical equipment-in the industrialisation and technological development of India over the past thirty years and the roles they will play in future. The analysis incorporate both national accounts and firm-specific data, the latter from the author's first-hand, on-location, in-depth case studies of ten of the largest firms each in machine tools, chemical equipment and heavy electricals manufacture. Details of the structural changes and real sectoral growth rates in Indian industry in general, and within the capital goods sector in particular, are presented, and their significance analysed. A similar task is performed also for investment. The proximate connection between investment on the one hand, and structural changes and real sectoral growth rates on the other is examined, and certain conclusions are drawn. Tentative hypotheses are advanced concerning the stagnation in machine tools, and the dynamism in chemical equipment and heavy electricals manufacture, and the political-economy aspects of investment, technological capacity and technological innovation, skills, market size, luxury consumption of the privileged classes, inter-industrial linkages and the non-performance in capital goods exports.||M.

The Budget, the author contends, contains trends from the past like growing channelisation of the economic surplus into the hands of the propertied classes and raising the profitability of investment in industries. However, to this is now being added curtailment of the role of the public sector and dependence on growth in demand for consumer durables as the new driving force in the economy.||Arun Kumar

However, little attention is paid to the significance of social innovations-and in particular, financial and fiscal innovations. It is the broad theme of this paper that financial innovations tend to reduce transaction costs and risk-both subjective and objective-and as a result bring about widening, deepening and integration of capital markets; such financial development accelerates the pace of economic development through its favourable impact on saving, investment and output. The relationship between finance and development and the precise role of financial innovations are discussed in Section I, while Section II deals with the nature and characteristics of financial innovations. The concluding section indicates the role of policy intervention in quickening the pace of financial development.||V. V. Bhatt

To understand how the performance of firms and industries is influenced by the context in which they operate, we therefore need to understand the reasoning by managements as regards the strategic choices. It is not sufficient, however, to have only a firm level perspective. A great number of firms in the engineering sector are multiproduct firms and firms in different countries often have a different output mix. This paper presents a preliminary analysis for two products, namely, hydraulic excavators and machining centres. After a section on the international industry for each product, the authors proceed with analysing the industry in India and South Korea, presenting the industry and the context in which it operates. Individual firms are then discussed at some length, followed by a discussion of the relationship between state policies and firm performance. Finally, a comparison is made between state policies and firm performance in the two countries.||Charles Edquist,Staffan Jacobsson

30/3/1985- ||review of agriculture, march 1985||4374221||Technical and Institutional Factors in Utilisation of Irrigation: A Case Study of Public Canals in Punjab||This paper argues that technical causes apart, the factors inhibiting fuller utilisation of irrigation potential have their roots in the social organisation and management of the use of irrigation waters. The author tries to establish this with reference to canal irrigation, on the basis primarily of fieldwork in the canal irrigated villages of Punjab. The author begins with a brief description of the technique of canal irrigation, highlighting the technical requirements for its optimal functioning and the limitations of the quality of irrigation it is possible to supply with canals. Section II discusses the pattern of utilisation of canals with a view to identifying associated problems. The author tries to show that there exist different modes of utilising the same technical source for different economic categories of cultivators. This has important implications in terms of the operational efficiency and the cost of irrigation faced by the respective groups, and this, in turn affects their production decisions and ultimate output. In Section III is presented a discussion of the implications of different modes of irrigation in terms of cost and efficiency. Finally, in the concluding Section, the author points to the poor efficiency of canal irrigation as currently practised and focuses on the social origin of some of the problems hindering the realisation of the irrigation potential that has been technically created. Also highlighted is the scale bias implicit in the economic adversities following this underutilisation; that is, the smaller farmers tend to suffer proportionately higher losses.||Jasveen Jairath

Second, there is a curious contrast between the Budget speech itself and the figures supplied in the Budget documents. Third, the Budget proposals betray an uneasy compromise between the champions of free enterprise and those of Central planning, with the former clearly on the ascendancy. Finally, the major thrust of the policy package seems to run counter to the basic approaches of both socialist and capitalist economic development.||Mihir Rakshit

1/11/1985- ||foreign technology slippliers' view of indian industry||4375029||Transfer of Italian Technology to India||The data presented in this paper show a dominant market-oriented strategy in Italian firms' technology transfer to India, with only minor importance attached to cost-oriented targets such as advantages deriving from low labour costs and from provision of raw materials. Transfer of technology to India does not, therefore, correspond to any vertically integrated strategy of international relocation of production. It is basically an instrument for penetrating a new, growing and potentially large market, which for Italian exporters is typically characterised by a very high 'psychic distance' arising from the cultural, historical, institutional and linguistic differences. An industrial breakdown of technologies transferred shows protection of existing export flows to be relatively more important in the case of chemical firms, whereas the motive of opening up new markets is more important in the machinery and electrical sectors.||Giovanni Balcet

In contrast, Marx's distinction-although often confused in his own writing on the subject-between the problems of profit realisation and historical proportionality assumes great significance in characterising capitalistic accumulation as a historical process. Indeed, one of the serious failures of many Keynesian-type growth models inspired by Roy Harrod is their insufficient recognition of this proportionality problem as an essential aspect of historical analysis.||Amit Bhaduri

An attempt is made to identify the gaps in our existing studies where future research efforts may be oriented. The paper begins by setting out an approach to the analysis of data on infant mortality. Following that the national and the state level estimates of neonatal, postneonatal and overall infant mortality by sex and rural-urban residence are reviewed. Attention is then focused on the available evidence on the contribution of various prenatal, natal and postnatal factors to infant mortality during different time period. This approach is adopted to help identify and assess the possible role of different intervention programmes.

In particular, they discussed the case where the sterile activity grows at the cost of the productive activity. The discussion, however, was based on a deterministic model where the uncertainty associated with the prices of agricultural commodities was assumed away. This paper tries to examine how the results obtained earlier are affected when uncertainty is explicitly introduced into the model. The authors briefly describe the model of dualistic agriculture built up in the earlier paper. Then they consider uncertainty in the market for agricultural commodities and see how that affects the interaction between the sterile and the productive activities in the agrarian economy. In particular, it is examined how government policies affect the profitability of different activities and thereby the pattern of accumulation in an agrarian dual economy.||Ajit K.

It is expected to provide the basis for a nation-wide debate which, the government hopes, would facilitate the formulation of new education policy. The main theme of the document is that education in India, from the primary school to the post-graduate university, is in an unholy mess. It is an official admission of failure. But, like most documents prepared by sincere and well intentioned bureaucrats, the response to the problem remains at the level of good intentions. The symptoms are criticised severely, the causes mentioned in passing and the cure left to do-gooders.||Dinesh Mohan
07/12/1985- ||special articles||4375090||Two Decades of Sterilisation, Modernisation, and Population Growth in a Rural Context||The most noteworthy feature of India's 1981 Census is perhaps the slight increase in the rate of population growth during the 1970s, despite the energetic government campaign to introduce birth control, the growing use of contraception, most especially sterilisation, a declining birth rate, and the modernisation of education, communications, and the economy. The apparent paradox of a stable or slightly increasing rate of population growth in the face of increasing modernisation, rising sterilisation, and falling fertility has been something of a surprise. The usual explanation, that mortality has declined as fast as or faster than fertility, while mathematically sound, offers little insight into a complex social phenomenon. The fertility rate and the number of persons who 'accept family planning' are more often invoked than survivorship in discussions of population growth. They are important, of course, but to minimise the significance of the size of completed families can lead to surprises when census results are published, as happened in the case of the 1981 Census. This paper deals with the relationships among sterilisation, modernisation, and survivorship in a north Indian village based on studies made in 1958-59, 1977-78, and 1983. Comparison of the demographic data for the decades of the 1960s and 1970s reveals to some extent the degree to which sterilisation has affected survivorship. Multiple regression analysis is used to reveal the relationships among sterlisation, survivorship, and various aspects of modernisation.||Stanley A. Freed,Ruth S. Freed

This force has had devastating consequences for the nation in the past, and has gravely retarded the process of integration in the post-independence period. The extent, the causes, the participants and the cost of communal disturbances since independence require careful scrutiny, which is attempted in this paper with the help of the data available in Section I. Sections II and III present a detailed report on the communal riot in Delhi of May 1974; Section II provides an account of the riot, and Section III reports the results of a post-riot survey. The paper is being published in two parts. The second part, comprising Sections II and III, will appear next week.||Gopal Krishna
28/9/1985- ||review of agriculture, september 1985||4374868||Some Dynamic Aspects of Rural Poverty in India||Studies on income distribution have tended to be point observations and throw little light on longer-term movements in relative inequality. Analysis of movement in poverty ratios on the basis of data on rural households collected by the NCAER for three years between 1968 and 1971, using probability models, have led the authors of the paper to conclude that long-term trends are divergent for different states. For seven states-Assam, Jammu and Kashmir, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu-a reduction in poverty ratios can be reasonably expected, while for Bihar, Orissa and Maharashtra, the converse holds true. The analysis, the authors conclude, suggests that a two-pronged strategy combining technical improvements in agricultural production, along with greater absorption of rural labour into non-agricultural activity like the food-for-work programme offers the greatest probability for reduction of rural poverty in India.||Irma Adelman,K.

Those who have no doctrinal discomfort with the notion of public enterprises will take the first course; and those who believe that the market is the norm and that any deviation from it (including the advent of the state into business) is a 'distortion', will tend towards the second course. In terms of practical recommendations in a given situation the two groups may possibly find themselves in agreement. Those who believe in a mixed economy could be mindful of the need to keep the growth of public enterprises within manageable and monitorable limits, to conserve scarce financial and managerial resources for important purposes and activities, and to shed public investments of no great consequence. Those who basically believe in free market economies and minimum state intervention could also be realistic enough to accept the position assigned to public enterprises in the strategies of many developing countries, and to concede that ways and means must be found to improve the performance of public enterprises while keeping them public, and that privatisation can at best be a remedy of the last resort, to be applied only in a very limited number of cases. And yet a difference in attitude and bias remains; and it is this which becomes evident in the terms in which 'the macro-economic analysis of the public enterprise sector' is advocated by some.||Ramaswamy R.

Famine is not, however, an event marked by the death of the victim. The basic failure in the understanding of famine is the inability to recognise the political, social and economic determinants that mark the onset of the process. We need, therefore, to redefine famine and identify the various factors, political, social, psychological and economic, that operate to keep large classes in the population under continuous pressure. The first part of the essay examines the inadequacy of current definitions of famine and suggests the need to question them. The available literature, including government records on famine as well as codes and manuals of relief administration, reflects the government view that famines are caused by the collapse of the network of social transactions and services, wages and assets, including the varied services and skills of the family unit or the village. The exchange entitlement theory is thus implicit in the literature and consequently does not represent an advance. The second part of the essay is devoted to its consideration.

Thus, while the levels of average wages in the same profession among various industries and also over different professions, within the same industry have been discussed at some length, their movement over time has received no attention. This paper seeks to contribute towards filling this gap. An attempt has been made here to provide empirical evidence of the extent and nature of the differences in the rates of growth of earnings in various Indian manufacturing industries over the period 1960-76, to identify the direction in which the inter-industry earnings structure has moved in this period and to examine the factors which have influenced these differences. Some reflections on certain aspects of a possible wage policy for India follow incidentally.||Swapan Kumar Sen

It argues that the source of the ineffectiveness of BPE lies in its inability to measure the performance of public enterprises in a way that is both fair to the managers and to the nation. The institutional set up of BPE too significantly contributes to its ineffectiveness. Finding the present system of performance evaluation used by BPE severely lacking, the paper suggests three axioms of public enterprise performance evaluation against which all future efforts of BPE should be judged.||Prajapati Trivedi

Over the years, other studies in India and elsewhere have elaborated on details of the picture to generate a conglomerate 'pastiche' of the typical pattern. Although emphasis on the various elements of this pastiche has varied, the overall picture seems to have been widely accepted; and it has significantly coloured the approach taken to policy in several countries. Some of the problems associated with this pattern had been commonly observed in India's experience (e g, restrictive contractual terms). Others could be less easily observed (e g, the high monopoly rent component within payments made); but their probable significance could be readily inferred from the underlying conditions commonly affecting transactions-conditions which added up to create a gross imbalance of power between technology suppliers and importers. Not surprisingly, therefore, policy designed in the light of these conditions and problems was basically 'defensive'. It could not on its own do much about these underlying conditions which were largely external to India; but it could do something to reduce the severity and incidence of the problems derived from them. However, some of the results of the UK study carried out within the overall EEC/India project on technology transfer suggest that in recent years several of those underlying conditions may have become significantly different from what they were in the 1950s and 1960s, and some of the problems may be less significant or widespread than they were. This paper focuses attention on those signs of change.||Martin Bell,Don Scott-Kemmis

A long list of studies of changes in cropping pattern undertaken by the economists can be easily presented. However, the central theme in most of these studies is that such changes occur due to advantageous relative prices, cost of cultivation and such specifically economic factors. However, there are certain other factors which cannot be called economic, but exert considerable influence in changing the cropping pattern. In the present study we shall highlight one such 'extra economic' factor, which is possibly the major reason behind the transformation in cropping pattern that is going on in the area under study.||J.

Most countries in the Third World used Indian plans as a model for their own advance. The question of how far India has progressed is therefore of relevance not only for India's future strategy but also for development planning and development economics. This paper concentrates upon reviewing India's achievements between 1950 and 1980 and comparing them with changes in its relative position in the world economy in general and in the Third World and China in particular. The review of the period 1950 to 1980 brings out sharply India's regression in the world economy in nearly all important sectors-gross domestic product, agriculture, industry, foreign trade-except for education. Although a late-comer to development with a promising start, India has fallen behind, all along the line, rather than move forward in catching up with the early entrants to industrialisation. India's relative economic position in the Third World, and particularly in comparison with China, has been marked by even greater regression.||Surendra J. Patel

It is the author's contention, however, that Roemer's method and the model that it produces are highly flawed and reject certain aspects of a Marxian approach which are central. Roemer posits a model of exploitation based upon unequal ownership of human (skills) and non-human property (land, means of production) and seeks to prove the superiority of this property rights model over the conventional surplus labour model of exploitation. In rejecting the labour theory of value, however, Roemer loses the core of the Marxist theory of exploitation, namely, the social relations of production between commodity producers and the exploitation of labour through the creation of surplus value at the point of production. This paper begins by presenting a brief outline of the leading features of Roemer's model. This is followed by the author's major criticisms of the substance and methodology of Roemer's General Theory. Finally, the author puts forward his arguments for the need for a surplus labour theory to understand exploitation and restates his position on the centrality of the labour theory of value.||Khalid Nadvi

But the behaviour of crop output during drought years, both under irrigated and unirrigated conditions, has not been subjected to any thorough analysis. The impression is that the Indian irrigation system is itself vulnerable to drought. Since the irrigation system extends to hardly 30 per cent of the country's crop acreage, it is conceivable that the diminution in crop output during drought could be mainly confined to the unirrigated segment of the farm sector. In that case the expert opinion about irrigation affording substantial insulation against drought appears plausible in a limited sense. This paper seeks to verify this insulation hypothesis.||B. D.

In Central America where there is a mobilised population pressing for democracy and structural change, Washington has opted for the 'terror-with-demonstration elections' formula, attempting to destroy the social movements and then promote (and publicise) elections among local loyalists that will ratify the status quo. The second track, used in South America, involves supporting elections where liberal politicians have gained hegemony over the mass movements and are willing to trade off soico-economic policies acceptable to the banks and armed forces for political democracy. The third track may be seen in operation in Chile. There the mass movements are powerful and mobilised, as in Central America, so that the core policy is one of continued support of authoritarian rule and state terror, with a subsidiary thrust of gently urging (but not insisting upon) gradual accommodation with centre-right civilian political forces. The fourth track, and the main thrust in Washington's Central American policy today, is to escalate the economic, political and military assault on Nicaragua. By neutralising US liberals and their Latin American civilian counterparts with rhetoric on 'resurgent democracy', the Reagan administration hopes to obtain a free hand in securing a military victory against this dangerously vital example of soical and economic (as well as political) democracy in Central America.||Edward S.

The authors' analysis of the budgetary involvement of the Centre and the states brings out that the Centre has made massive inroads into state subjects through the financial backdoor. As a consequence, the separation between the state subjects and Central subjects can be said to have become less and less clear. A major state subject like agriculture has virtually been transformed into a concurrent subject. As for industry, it has become more or less a Union subject. This is all the more true if financial and other institutions controlled by the Centre are also taken into account. Through these institutions, the Centre's hold in the concerned fields has become even stronger.||K. K. George,I. S. Gulati

Her poems pick up the diction of the English decadents, transposing the images into India. The pained passive women in her poetry stand however in radical contrast to Naidu's own life: she was a close friend of Gandhi's and active in the National movement, suffering imprisonment numerous times. In 1925 she was elected the first Indian women president of the National Congress. How can the cleft between her poetry and her politics be explained? What does it reveal about the complex procedures of Naidu's own evolving feminism as it struggled with colonialism?||Meena Alexander

Within this structure the workers were subjected to a physical and social control which severely restricted their mobility within and outside the plantations and isolated them from the outside world. The workers expressed their protests against this arrangement in different forms over time. Beginning with individual acts of desertion their protests became collective. In the post-World War I period workers' protests became somewhat organised and distinctly political in nature. The years 1920-22 witnessed increasing articulation of workers' grievances and intensity of protests in the form of strikes. The tea garden workers' struggle did not, however, crystallise into a unified and organised labour movement in the Assam Valley. The major constraining factors were the various features of the plantation structure such as restrictions on mobility, enforced isolation and social and physical control of the workers. These along with the oppressive state machinery prevented the emergence of a political leadership from among the workers themselves. And the possibility of outsiders providing a political leadership was severly limited because of the general indifference of the nationalist leadership to the whole question of workers' protests vis-a-vis the planters. The hindrances to the development of class consciousness among plantation workers cannot be fully understood without reference to the nature of the work which primarily was agricultural. Thus organisation as well as consciousnes could develop as it might in the agrarian sector and not in the modern industrial sector. However, such a possibility was aborted over a long period because the colonial regime allowed the planters to keep workers under control through various legal and extra-legal means.||Rana Pratap Behal

While the constraints to successful implementation may in some instances be technical ones, in many other cases they are social in nature. Indeed, the knowledge about energy related technology greatly exceeds knowledge about the problems such technology is meant to solve. The present article is based on 18 months of participatory action research in a village of eastern Uttar Pradesh. It analyses the energy needs of the villagers in relation to their problems and priorities, and presents the experiences of the introduction of several technologies. It is shown that the process of adoption of different technologies has a direct connection with the social and economic condition of the villagers, that determines their needs and constraints and hence the nature and level of their participation. Consideration of factors like poverty, household time budgeting, resource access and social organisation is seen to provide important perspectives for refining renewable energy development strategies in villages.||Varun Vidyarthi

Though the impact of the social reform movements of nineteenth century India was not felt deeply in Assam, partly because of the structure of the Assamese society and partly because of the slow trickle of new ideas associated with Western education into this region, the efforts of the American Baptist missionaries and of a handful of Assamese who were exposed to the exciting intellectual climate of Calcutta succeeded in infusing a spirit of rationalism and social awareness into the Assamese intellectual world. There was no major social reform movement in nineteenth century Assam, but the literature of this period bears ample evidence of the growing awareness amongst the educated Assamese of those features of the society which they felt were responsible for its continued backwardness, especially in comparison with the economic and cultural progress achieved by neighbouring Bengal. This paper attempts to examine only the beginnings of social criticism presented through Orunodoi, a journal published by the American Baptist missionaries from Sibsagar in 1846. This journal is of historic importance not only for being the first journal-cum-newspaper in the Assamese language but also for the light it throws on the Assamese social life of the time.||Tilottoma Misra

The forces of desertification have gathered momentum within this zone. If this trend is to be reversed a suitable system of mixed farming with emphasis on animal husbandry has to be evolved and practised. In evolving such a programme the choice of appropriate livestock becomes crucial. Where feed is scarce and of low nutritive value larger animals are at a disadvantage because of their greater maintenance requirements. Smaller animals like the goat with lower maintenance needs can cover large areas to gather sufficient nutrients for survival and for minimum production of meat and milk. There are two conflicting views about the goat's role in land use. One view holds that the goat is the major cause of rangeland destruction and soil erosion, and its propogation should be checked. But a contradictory opinion is that the goat is after all a major supplier of animal protein and that since it usually consumes the scrub left-over from the overgrazing by cattle and sheep, it is unrealistic to blame the goat for environmental destruction. The authors, who subscribe to the latter view, discuss why it is ecologically necessary to assign the goat its rightful place in plans for arid and semi-arid regions.||K. A. Shankarnarayan,H. C.

They signally failed to understand the particular form of male supremacy in their own culture, or to analyse how they created and reinforced aspects of male oppression within Indian culture, seeing no parallels between the different cultural forms of male dominance in the two countries. The women's movement in India did not concentrate on male supremacy to the exclusion of foreign domination as the cause of their inequality, for in India male domination alone did not account for women's subordination. The colonists both improved women's position and worsened it in particular ways, but their actions were dictated, not out of concern for women, but out of the desire to maintain their financial interests and political power in the foreign country. Equally, it is clear that women's inequality was not identical with foreign rule, for the men in the nationalist movement opposed the women's demands when these threatened male privileges in the family; and despite the gains made at Independence, women's subordination did not disappear with the ending of political domination. The women's movement recognised this, constructing their demands around women's domestic, as well as political oppression, and organising autonomously for the emancipation of women rather than simply absorbing themselves into the freedom movement. So the Indian women's movement attacked both male supremacy and foreign domination. What inhibited them from emphasising male supremacy as one cause of their oppression was the use that would be made of such a focus in Britain. This concern itself supports the movement's analysis that neither male domination nor imperialism alone accounts for women's subordination, but that both act upon the gender division, and are linked in perpetuating women's oppression.||Joanna Liddle,Rama Joshi

The purpose of the present paper is to trace the rising concentration in the tyre industry and its resultant effects on the pricing behaviour of firms. The industry which was dominated by MNCs has now come to be dominated by Indian business houses and the recent horizontal and vertical integrations by some of the firms have added a new dimension to the concentration. The government's effort to deconcentrate the industry has been effectively neutralised by these developments.||Sunil Mani

It enabled them to look back on the order of the Golden Age of Hindus and at the same time look forward to the progress generated by British rule. Bankimchandra's later novels such as "Anandmath", far from dismissing the modernising influence of Positivism, in fact, represents a crisis in his nationalist consciousness. These novels create a parable of the nationalist confrontation and womanhood becomes the emblem of both the threatened and ravaged order as well as of the resistance to such ravages. Comte's glorification of woman undergoes a sea-change and Bankim's neo-positivist heroine of Anandmath is a fighter to the last who refuses to go back to the 'enclosed space' of domesticity.||Jasodhara Bagchi
30/11/1985- ||special articles||4375061||Reorientation of Rural Development Programmes: A Note on Some Basic Issues||Rural Poverty is rooted in the system in which the poor are deprived of assets but do not gain adequately the support of employment in the organised sector. There is a stubborn persistence of its incidence as rural resources are diverted to elite consumption and to meet the needs of investment for the elite through market processes. Where there is no socialisation of assets or radical land reforms, complemented by a strong public sector, there are thus formidable obstacles to reduction in the incidence of poverty. There will be need for a mix of employment and asset development programmes for the poor, the mix depending upon the need of each location. These will, however, succeed only if there is no drain of rural resources through market processes and the organisation of rural development programmes facilitates the emergence of the group power of the poor. The former requires that the peasants should gain control over markets and processing units through their own organisation and rural surplus should be used for diversification of the rural economy. The latter requires a shift from individual to group approaches and control of poorer groups over Panchayat Raj bodies which need to be vested with the responsibility for area development.||G.

While some are optimistic about the bright future of the industry, some doubt its very survival. Further, in view of the energy crisis, it is imperative that for any future development of the industry the aspects of alternative fuels and saving of fuel should be examined in a systemic way. The problems currently plaguing the industry are many. Some of the major ones are defective factory layout, inadequate R and D facilities, improper designs, poor after-sales service and marketing of substandard and fuel-inefficient engines. This paper provides specific suggestions for redressal of these problems. Among other things, it suggests what should be done in regard to the following aspects: measures to stimulate future demand, design modifications, alternative fuels, alternative uses, creating R and D infrastructure, organisational requirements, and research efforts necessary in the future.||R.

The present paper reports on two surveys conducted in 1983 and 1984-85: the first followed the methodology and generated results comparable to the European projects described in the present issue of the EPW, whilst the second survey was conducted independently by our institute (the Institute of Developing Economies, Tokyo). The objects of this paper are first to highlight the importance of modifying foreign technology as evidenced by the Japanese experience, and second, to bring out the nature of and the specific difficulties in the transfer of technology from Japan to India.||Shoji Ito

This potential, however, varies as between traditional and non-traditional areas because of differing costs of production of mulberry leaf and rearing of silkworms. This note attempts to assess the extent of these differences by working out the comparative costs of production on the basis of a sample of households for two points of time, 1980-81 and 1983-84. Broadly the results indicate that the employment potential is higher for hired labour in the case of mulberry leaf cultivation, while the family labour component is more pronounced in the case of silkworm rearing.||H.

Education and Elites in India||This paper reviews the function of education in the circulation of elite roles in Indian society which is seen as an important aspect of the path of egalitarian social change outlined in the Constitution. The paper is divided into three sections. The first section discusses a basic dialectic that governs the relationship between education and social mobility in general and mobility to elite positions in particular. Section two examines the distribution of opportunities for elite status in the case of one elite role, namely, the administrative service. This section also discusses the limits within which education has contributed to social mobility. Section three considers some recent developments that point towards a crisis in the elite's identity. The paper ends with a discussion of the implications of this crisis for education.||Krishna Kumar

In prompt return, this system produced communal demands which were further encouraged by political leaders seeking to mobilise communal followings. Expanded higher educational opportunities seem to have fuelled communal virulence rather than promoting communal harmony as is the common shibboleth. The mix of sectional education and communal politics in the early decades of Sri Lanka's independence seems to mark the origins of the violent confrontation being witnessed today between the Sinhalese majority and the Ceylon Tamil minority.||Jawid Laiq

The results demonstrate that fertiliser subsidy policy is more beneficial than price-support, and called for reducing the fertiliser price by about 27 per cent to achieve self-sufficiency. Low price elasticity of output, high price elasticity of fertiliser demand and high production elasticity of fertiliser contributed to the relative superiority of fertiliser subsidy policy over price-support policy. Distributional and inflationary implications indicate that the fertiliser subsidy policy is more egalitarian than the price-support policy and is also anti-inflationary.||Jagrup Singh Sidhu,D. S.

This paper examines whether such disparities have in fact widened. Changes in regional disparities for all crops in terms of output per area and output per capita (to take account of demographic pressures) and the interconnections between the two measures are examined across agro-climatic regions in late 1970s as compared to early 1970s and 1960s. Also examined are differences in the levels of output per area and output per capita across different growth classes.||S. Mahendra Dev

If it is determined mainly by the market forces, it may help in taking appropriate decisions about saving, investment, allocation of resources, financial and monetary policy, etc. However, the level and structure of interest rates in India have remained very closely regulated by the authorities.

30/3/1985- ||special articles||4374227||Marxist Ideas in Development Economics: A Brief Evaluation||In development economics, as in much of social sciences in general, the most valuable contribution of the Marxist approach is the sense of history with which it is imbued, its focus on the tension between property relations and productive potential in a given social formation, and on the importance of collective action and power in enhancing or thwarting processes of institutional change to resolve that tension, its insistence on bringing to the forefront of public policy debates an analysis of the nature of the state and the constellation of power groupings in civil society, and, of course, its abiding commitment to certain normative ideas on questions of exploitation and injustice. Its processes of reasoning, however, leave much to be desired, with its frequent substitution of convenient teleology for explanatory mechanisms and of a kind of murky institutionalism for rigorous rationale of contractual arrangements, and its failure to base aggregative results firmly on consistent actions of economic agents at the micro-level, ignoring as a consequence incentive compatibility problems, issues of contract enforcement and repetitive transactions, strategic interaction of agents (even with commonality of class interests), the free rider problem in class formation and action, and the disequilibrium dynamics of adjustment paths. Some versions of the Marxist approach also claim too much in the generality of its laws of motion of history, overlooking important historical specificities and localised contexts of culture, geography and demography not always reflecting the technological base. In development planning literature, it also brings a certain legacy of single-minded pursuit of accumulation (along with an autarchic zeal), often slighting acute problems of present consumption, incentives, adjustments, managerial and administrative capacities, ecological balance, and ways of expanding human capabilities beyond improvements on the technological frontier.||Pranab Bardhan

In particular, it looks at the current fertiliser subsidies and uses a general equilibrium model of India's agricultural sector to simulate the likely consequences of the removal of these subsidies on agricultural performance and the overall distribution of income. The model is also used to determine the net effects of reallocating fertiliser subsidies to finance other government sponsored agricultural programmes instead as, for instance, for expanding irrigation.||Jaime Quizon

These actions took many forms: forms that were not primitive precursors of 20th century unionism but which did, on occasion, include formally organised unions. Often these actions were planned, complex and effective responses to job-related oppression and exploitation as well as to opportunities perceived by the workers to contain beneficial possibilities. The collective action was not only the expression of grievances among a growing body of industrial labourers (important though they were) but of a bigger and more fundamental social grouping: an emerging class, a working class, of waged labour; of men and women who had to depend increasingly on the sale of their labour to survive. This paper illustrates these developments within the context of the railway workforce.||Ian J. Kerr

The answer is an obvious 'no'. But if the planning process is to be taken seriously, a plan which had the endorsement of the Central and state governments only eight months earlier cannot in its very first year be departed from without so much as a mention of the changes in the intervening period which call for this departure. The only event which will justify such a departure is the fear of a big price rise. The government does not concede any such contingency; but if it did, two logical consequences would follow. The first would be insistence on all efforts to ensure economy and efficiency of expenditure. The second would be observance of priorities in curtailment of expenditure beginning from directions where it would hurt the least-non-plan non-development expenditure, non-plan developmental expenditure and then plan expenditure. The priorities followed seem to be all the other way round.||D. T. Lakdawala

The anti-nautch campaign led to the suppression of the regional dance tradition which had been sustained by the devadasi. Simultaneously the art was being revived in its 'pure form' as Bharat Natyam. The paradox of the emergence of two parallel equally vociferous reform and revival movements can only be understood by examining the colonial context and native political activity. The anti-nautch campaign became inextricably linked up with the communal politics of the Dravidian movement, whilst the 'revival' movement was sustained and generated by the Brahmin-dominated Theosophical movement and the Congress. While the reformers presented the Hindu temple dancer as a 'prostitute' in order to do away with her, the revivalists presented her as a 'nun' in order to incarnate her afresh.||Amrit Srinivasan
27/7/1985- ||review of political economy, july 1985||4374636||Classical and Contemporary Approaches to Agrarian Capitalism||The classical sources on the 'agrarian question' were concerned with developing general theoretical principles as well as applying them to particular social and historical contexts. The recent discussion on the mode of production in Indian agriculture drew upon the theoretical categories and arguments developed in these earlier texts, in particular the paradigm of capitalist development. The objective of this paper is to dwell upon certain key issues in the classical texts so as to show how these provide insights into, and in some cases anticipate, the controversies arising in the Indian debate. Equally it is to focus upon those aspects of the South Asian experience which have thrown up certain anomalies requiring critical reformulation of the paradigm itself.||Shapan Adnan

17/8/1985- ||special articles||4374716||Scholarship on China: Victim of Political Campaigns||Scholarship on China seems to have accepted that the series of events that have occurred in that country after 1949 are to be regarded as the outcome of a sharp and protracted struggle within the Communist party leadership over the path China's efforts at socialist reconstruction ought to follow: the Maoist path with its stress on revolution, or the Liuist path with its stress on the development of the productive forces. Scholarship dealing with the post-Mao period again betrays the same conscious, or in some cases perhaps unconscious, acceptance of the 'two-line struggle' argument. Thus while one section of scholars is busy arguing that a 'capitalist restoration' has occurred in present-day China, another section is involved in defending the revolutionary credentials of the new regime. It is the contention of this paper that the so-called 'two lines' are really different approaches that the political culture allows at a particular point of time as equally legitimate for the solution of contingent and pressing problems. Thus, though the political culture is relatively stable and fixed this is not to say that (a) it does not have a flexibility of its own, or (b) is incapable of change. It has its time-scale and temporal cycle, but the process of transformation is neither an open-ended or multi-vocal affair, nor does it take the form of violent zig-zag-like swings from one extreme to another. Rather it represents a process of giving salience now to one aspect and now to another aspect of the political culture.||Harmala Kaur Gupta

It also discusses the scope for inclusion of a number of items which are at present excluded from the 'net proceeds' of income tax. Finally, it is suggested that since a major portion of the proceeds of income tax goes to the states and this constitutes an important part of the states' finances, it would be setting a healthy trend if the states are consulted by the Centre before it introduces major changes in income tax policy.||Hemlata Rao

More recently, debates about technology import policy have focused on the role of technical collaborations in the technological development of industry. This paper examines the extent to which Indo-British collaboration agreements have contributed to the technological capacities of Indian firms. Several factors have had an influence on the technological content of the agreements. In some infrequent cases the gap between the planned content of the knowledge flows and the potential content was because the Indian firms had already developed substantial technological capacities and 'required' only discrete elements of new knowledge. In others, the technology supplier was unwilling to provide more technical knowledge. In some cases, the technology importers saw no point in developing their technological capacities beyond the level necessary to support basic production objectives. Another reason was government restrictions on royalty rates and duration of agreements. The limited technological dynamism of many Indian technology importing firms is partly a consequence of these prevalent patterns.||Don Scott-Kemmis,Martin Bell
13/7/1985- ||special articles||4374587||The Communalising of Punjab, 1980-1985||Any attempt to comprehend the problem of contemporary Punjab should begin by first accepting the reality that a new minority consciousness has emerged. In which case neither the ethnicised history of a community, such as the Sikhs, nor the mere existence of a communal party like the Akali Dal, can explain, singly or jointly, the specificity of this new phenomenon. It is for anthropology and sociology to plumb the depths of this problem but only after the practitioners of these disciplines too realise the uniqueness of the event. For so many years these disciplines had only primitive communal givens to contend with and write about. This gave rise to the belief that communal mobilisations only occurred between certain culturally pre-ordained groups. It was as if every dyad of proven communalism was a pair bound by a very special and inherent tie of antagonism, such as between the Hindus and Muslims or between scheduled castes and upper castes. Punjab over the last six years should have changed all that. It has demonstrated that communalism does not require that its passions be always traceable to hoary traditions in order to raise dust and settle it down with blood. The communalising of Punjab over the last six years provides the only active historical base for the comprehension of the problem.||Dipankar Gupta

The author, however, contends that Bombay's centrality is the result rather than the cause of its commercial and political success. The rise of Bombay in fact illustrates two distinctive features of colonial rule: the primacy of the colonial port city and the substitution of the indigenous urban network by a new colonial urban hierarchy headed by the major colonial port city.||Meera Kosambi

An attempt has been made in the present study to construct unit-value indices and quantum indices of India's invisible receipts and payments. If transfers are excluded from invisibles, these indices for invisible receipts represent 100 per cent of changes in such receipts. With the inclusion of transfers, however, these indices would account for only 50 per cent of invisible earnings. On the payment side, these indices of invisible payments represent more than 65 per cent of total invisible payments if government and private transfers are taken into account.||Neela Mukherjee

23/3/1985- ||special articles||4374202||Trade Unions, Rule Making and Industrial Relations||This paper seeks to explain industrial conflict and consensus by reference to the process of setting norms. In the context of Indian industrial relations, it is possible to identify different kinds of norms with divergent sources. There are norms by consent; by executive fiat; by third party mediation in the form of conciliation, arbitration or adjudication; and by legislation. There are in addition grey areas where norms have either not crystallised or are set independently and in conflict by labour and management. The author assesses the consequences of different kinds of norms for industrial relations. The objective is not a comprehensive analysis of all norms and normless areas in any particular situation, but to choose examples from a wide range of situations to explain the roots of conflict and co-operation between labour and management. The instances are drawn from field researches among workers and their unions and interaction with managers from a cross-section of Indian industry.||E. A. Ramaswamy

In all these respects, the evidence is sufficiently suggestive to warrant more detailed analysis.||A. Vaidyanathan

But in the existing state of knowledge the issue of whether caste is infrastructure or super-structure cannot be subjected to a meaningful analysis because of the inadequacies of the data used by scholars who have relied primarily on secondary sources. Before one can argue that caste constituted infrastructure, or was part of the superstructure, we need to have a full-fledged diachronic study of caste which combines Indology with history and anthropology: there is need for both chronological clarity and the rigorous use of sources. There is also a need to show the relation between caste categories and other social and economic categories over time. This paper intervenes in the discussion by bringing in the evidence of Buddhist literature and the earliest group of inscriptions available for research, both of which have been totally ignored by scholars writing on caste. This evidence is in our opinion the most reliable set of sources for an empirical analysis of social and economic categories in ancient India.||Uma Chakravarti

The model considers adequate time structure behind the accelerator type relation between investment and capacity output and expresses the total plan investment as a function of pre- as well as post-terminal rates of growth of capacity output. These rates of growth, on the other hand, can be treated as unknown solution variables in a plan model and the total plan investment can be estimated consistently with plan objectives. The paper describes the model and uses it for estimating the total plan investment during the Sixth Plan period. The results obtained are then compared and discussed in relation to those reported in the Technical Note on the Sixth Plan.||K. C. Majumdar,Debdas Bandyopadhyay

It is argued in this paper that this heavy bias is primarily a result of government policy. Moreover, not only is such a strategy less effective from the perspective of the family planning programme, it can also lead to an unnecessary strain on women, vasectomy being far simpler and safer than tubectomy, including laparoscopy; especially when it is performed in mass sterilisation camps in the rush to achieve targets.||Alaka M.

02/2/1985- ||special articles||4374035||Modelling the Crisis: Megasociety, Multiple Codes, and Social Blanks||This paper presents a model interpreting the social crisis in contemporary India in the following terms. The long historical social processes characteristic of India have been markedly different from those in Europe. Undergirded by the Roman Catholic Church and working with still older cultural resources, such as Greek logic and Roman legal techniques, European societies moved towards a unification of codes which facilitated an enlarging of operative scales, culminating in the megasocieties of our time. Colonialism fitted India with a megasocietal technosocial frame for its own purposes; but the highly segmented Indian social space had carried a multiplicity of codes. As these diverse codes flow into the megasocietal institutions, these latter move towards breakdown: In this and in other regards, the maintaining and the renewing of a megasociety calls for a range of institutional capabilities whose weakness or absence among us-'social blanks'-accounts for our difficulties with the task that history has set us.||Satish Saberwal

This paper is confined to the period 1850s-70s which saw the publication of major ideological statements concerning women by Mill, Darwin and Ruskin which together helped to identify the parameters of the conflict of ideologies in this period, parameters which are counterpointed by the socialist thinking on the woman question which had emerged earlier. The ideological positions of Mill, Darwin and Ruskin did not arise in a vacuum; they were embattled positions taken in the wake of social changes brought on by industrial capitalism and the emergence of a women's movement. The author deals with this process in the first part of the paper and in the second with the ideologies, both feminist and anti-feminist, and their absorption within the movement.||Sudesh Vaid

Despite this, as compared to other parts of Bengal, North Bengal has remained backward. The condition of such existence does not inhere in the natural condition of soil, climate or even population but in the far-reaching structural consequences brought about by foreign capital investment. These structural consequences comprised in restricted and uneven development which is a type of development characterised by extreme sectoral imbalance and an incapacity of the economy to gear its resources to the development of domestic market and the economic needs of the indigenous population. Such structural underdevelopment was the result of the modalities of articulation between the modern plantation sector and the traditional subsistence-oriented sector.||Virginius Xaxa

An attempt is made to identify the gaps in our existing studies where future research efforts may be oriented. The paper begins by setting out an approach to the analysis of data on infant mortality. Following that the national and the state level estimates of neonatal, postneonatal and overall infant mortality by sex and rural-urban residence are reviewed. Attention is then focused on the available evidence on the contribution of various prenatal, natal and postnatal factors to infant mortality during different time period. This approach is adopted to help identify and assess the possible role of different intervention programmes. [The paper is being published in three parts for reasons of space.

In contradistinction to other studies, this paper focuses on the content of colonial forestry science, with a view to understanding its social and cultural underpinnings. It is argued that the structure of forestry science was predicated on its "other"-viz the cultural and social meaning traditionally ascribed to the forests in different parts of India. Having disrupted existing forms of resource utilisation, scientific forestry had to contend with recurrent and widespread protest. This led to the evolution of sophisticated techniques, described in this paper, that could meet the often conflicting aims of commercial timber production and the preemption of peasant protest. Not surprisingly, this lead to a major dislocation in agrarian relations in Uttarakhand.||Ramachandra Guha

Virtually no attempt has been made to study the dialectics of change taking place in the tribal economy of the state. For their part, economists too have ignored this segment of the economy. Economic planners, in their attempt to formulate development as well as welfare plans for the Scheduled Tribes, have therefore relied exclusively on sociological and anthropological studies, without a correct perception of the dynamics of the tribal economy. The objective of the present study is to examine the extent of intra-regional variations in the levels of socio-economic development of the hill-tribes of Kerala and to understand the possible reasons for such variations.||M.

The author argues that the credentials of the strategy in this regard are highly dubious. If anything, it entails contractionary possibilities in the short or even medium term. Additionally, it is almost certain to have adverse balance of payments implications, necessitating larger foreign borrowings. It also entails in certain situations greater inflationary possibilities insofar as larger Budget deficits are resorted to for financing tax concessions. All this moreover is in addition to the new strategy's patently inegalitarian character, and the fact that it would strengthen the position of multinational corporations in the Indian economy with all the socio-political consequences that flow therefrom.||Prabhat Patnaik

This paper examines the sectoral change at more disaggregated levels and relates the census data on employment to net domestic product and concludes that the shift in employment away from agriculture is likely to have benefited all except four per cent of the male and all but 12 per cent of the main workers of both sexes in 1981.||Sudha Deshpande,L.

The legacy of colonialism consists of emphasis on the maintenance of law and order, neglect of people's languages, weak local administration, acceptance of Westernisation with all its faults, and higher status and salaries of the loyal generalists who control and discipline specialists and the populace. Monopoly capitalism and the building of the nation state lead to centralisation ('unity and integrity'), unbalanced growth and preference to loyalty over merit. The conflict and balancing of land-owning and capital-owning sections of the bourgeoisie lead to autonomisation of the state and rule by the bureaucracy unchecked by a legislature (as in contemporary Punjab). The acceptance of the domination of international monopoly capital by the ruling class in its own narrow interest leads to dependency, and hinders the growth of science and technology. All these factors together lead to increasing pauperisation, and ineffectiveness of the programmes of poverty removal.||Satya Deva

While a minority of the firms either find the policies to be too restrictive or, on the other hand, have benefited from them in their bargaining for a better price, a majority have remained largely unaffected by them. Further, while these policies have been successful in regulating certain quantitative aspects of technology imports (payments, duration, etc), their success in promoting technological development activities within Indian industry has been limited. Technological activities of Indian firms, it is argued here, are far more sensitive to government policies pertaining to the nature of the market and the industrial structure than to those which are explicitly aimed at promoting technology development. The latter policies can be successful only if an industrial environment conducive to innovative activity is simultaneously created. On the other hand, modifications in technology policy alone (such as a liberal payment policy, greater R and D incentives, etc) without necessary changes in industrial policy will fail to infuse technological dynamism into Indian industry.||Ghayur Alam

It tries to answer the question: What was a demographic crisis under the ancient demographic pattern of colonial southern India? For this, the author leans on the methodological experience of the works of French historians of the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly the pioneering works of Jean Meuvret and Pierre Goubert. According to them, the demographic crisis is to be defined bringing to the fore the three fundamental traits that characterise it: a marked rise in the prices of staple foodstuff, a peak of mortality and, at the same period, a fall in conceptions. The second question raised by the author is: how does the demographic regime work after the crisis to allow the population to recover?||Roland Lardinois

The main beneficiaries of the international services trade have been a few developed market economies and a small number of large TNCs. The latter are the driving force behind this internationalisation, contributing to an accelerated liquidation of medium and small-scale firms that traditionally dominated the field. No less rapid have been the disintegration of barriers between individual service sectors and the rise of transnational service conglomerates and transnational integral conglomerates. When the TNCs attained dominance, which happened at different times and in varying degrees of intensity in different sectors, it was US and Japanese corporations that were in the lead. TNCs from these two countries exercise a far more pervasive control over services in the world market than they do over agriculture, mining and manufacturing. TNCs are at present impelling the service factor forward at a faster pace than any other sector. The expansion of services has also been accompanied by a serious decline in corporate accountability, due to service companies' access to tax-havens, flags of convenience, bank secrecy laws and a large array of legal and illegal arrangements.

11/5/1985- ||special articles||4374392||Industrial Development: Issues and Policy Options||One set of economists attribute the low growth rates of South Asia, and India in particular, to the strategy of import substitution that these economies followed in contrast to what these economists call the export-led growth strategy that the East Asian countries have followed. Thus countries like Japan and South Korea are supposed to have followed export-led growth while India followed an import substitution policy; while the former regimes liberalised externally, the Indian regime was very restrictive in the domestic as well as in the foreign sectors. Facts do not, however, support these assumptions about Japan and South Korea. To start with, both these countries followed import substitution policies till recently, which enabled these countries to develop a strong industrial base and which later on enabled them to expand their exports. The rapid growth of their exports was the result of their development and not the other way round. In recent months there have been signs of change in the economic policy of the Government of India. It is important, however, that the contemplated change should not aim at taking the economy even closer to the neoclassical ideal of free trade, liberalisation, free operation of market mechanism and price variables. Development consists in the production of new goods, introduction of new methods in production, creation of new markets and materials, all of which depend on non-price and non-free market variables like technological change, R and D and innovations.||N.

06/4/1985- ||special articles||4374252||Origins of Co-operative Sugar Industry in Maharashtra||An attempt is made in this paper to understand the origins of the development of the co-operative sugar industry in the Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra. The conditions leading to the emergence of a rich peasant strata in the region in the early 1900s and the relevant characteristics of the peasantry are discussed in Section I. The spread of canal irrigation, coupled with financial support from a co-operative credit infrastructure, enabled the rich peasants to cultivate sugarcane, extensively as well as intensively, as seen in Sections II and III. The crisis of the great agricultural depression of the early 1930s provoked a series of defensive responses from the rich peasantry. Some of these responses, discussed in Section IV, brought about certain conditions necessary for the subsequent shift, two decades later, into co-operative manufacture and marketing of sugar. The development of a modern sugar industry received a great boost in the early 1930s. This together with the actual setting up of the pioneering co-operative sugar enterprises is discussed in Section V.||Ignatius Chithelen

Given that commodity taxes predominate in the government's tax revenues, this is an obvious lacuna. Study of excise duty evasion is especially opportune now for many reasons. First, the needs of resource mobilisation for the Seventh Plan call for minimising such evasion. Further, there is a belief that Central excise duties are better administered than states' sales taxes and this argument is sometimes extended to suggest expansion of the list of items covered under additional excise duties. It would, therefore, be interesting to examine the extent of tax evasion in respect of a commodity on which the states have surrendered the right to levy sales tax in lieu of additional excise duties.||M.

Gandhi's ideas about women and their role in public life was a departure from those of the 19th century reformers. He saw women as a potential force in the struggle to build a new social order. He consciously attempted to articulate the connections between private and public life in order to bring women into the struggle. However, he failed to come to terms with the fact that oppression is not a moral condition but a social and historical experience relating to production relations. On the other hand even while insisting that a woman's real sphere of activity was the home, he was instrumental in creating conditions which could help women break the shackles of domesticity. [The first two parts of the article which deal with Gandhi's views on the nature of women's oppression and the influence his ideas had in drawing women into the freedom movement were published last week. The third part, which reviews his personal relationships with women, appears below.]||Madhu Kishwar

03/8/1985- ||special articles||4374664||Employment Goals and Development Priorities||By adopting a concept of standard person-years in the Sixth Plan for measuring employment, the earlier neglect of the productivity aspect of employment was partly removed and the concept of gainful employment was emphasised. In this sense in the Sixth Plan for the first time the goal of employment and the goal of poverty eradication were reconciled and the apparent trade-off between employment generation and growth largely rationalised. However, the earlier approach of treating employment as a recursive process remained unchanged in the Sixth Plan. No new approaches for choosing the production sectors keeping in view the need for maximising employment, say, by an appropriate policy of demand management or choice of techniques, were explored. In recent debates on the choice of the desired employment strategies for the Seventh Plan, this aspect has been specially emphasised. But at the same time not much thought has been devoted to the selection of a 'choice criteria' for prioritisation of sectors for making investment decisions keeping in view optimisation of employment as a major objective. This paper is an attempt towards filling this gap.||S. P. Gupta,T. G. Srinivasan

The Chinese leadership, it would appear from this, feels emboldened to carry forward the offensive launched initially in 1978 by revising the role of the communes, into the sensitive areas of industry, commerce, science and culture. At the same time, there may be uncertain times ahead for China. Successful experiments with material incentives and decentralisation notwithstanding, the substantive dimensions of the modernisation process may unfold yet another set of dialectics to be tackled by Deng Xiao-ping's successors.||T.

The author's concern is with the fiscal, monetary and trade policies of the major developed economies and their actual and potential impact on world economic activity. The basic presumption underlying the discussion is that the behaviour of these economies is crucially important for possibilities for adjustments and growth in developing economies as well. In the first section of the paper the nature of the current economic recovery and the problem that still remain are analysed. Subsequent sections consider briefly some of the major issues that emerge: the implications of the US budget and trade deficits, exchange rate and interest rate behaviour and possibilities of expansion elsewhere in the developed world. The final section touches on some of the implications for developing countries.||Jayati Ghosh

In addition to analysing the principal demographic trends in major Asian countries, the author identifies the determinants of fertility in the countries which have experienced a significant decline in their levels. The positions taken by Asian countries at the two recent UN population conferences are also discussed.||Moni Nag

10/8/1985- ||special articles||4374694||Intoxication as a Social Evil: Anti-Alcohol Movement in Uttarakhand||The present anti-alcohol movement in Uttarakhand radically differs from earlier attempts to combat alcoholism. Although liquor remains the primary focus, the movement recognises the social system in which intoxication operates. While alcoholism is the means by which state commercialisation has sapped the vitality of the hill society, it is only a symptom of the deeper malaise of predatory capitalist 'development'. There has been a consistent attempt to understand alcohol as a social phenomenon. On different occasions, activists of the movement have made it clear that their opposition is not intended as an encroachment on the individual rights of citizens and they are not dreaming of a society with total and successful prohibition. However, in a region where the basic necessities of food, clothing and shelter are a growing problem for the bulk of the population, alcohol consumption cannot be viewed with equanimity. The major demand of the movement has been employment in place of alcohol. It is a bitter irony that while army recruitment marked the advent of liquor in Uttarakhand, youths are now rejected by the military on grounds of ill-health. Prohibition by itself is not adequate to eradicate alcoholism as a social evil; on the contrary, it may have certain adverse consequences. As such, the anti-alcohol movement views prohibition as the first step in a more fundamental restructuring of society.||Shekhar Pathak
26/10/1985- ||special article||4374979||Regional Variations in Impact of Anti-Poverty Programmes: A Review of Evidence||Under the government's anti-poverty programmes self-employment for the rural poor is sought to be generated by two routes: provision of income-generating non-land assets under the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP), and equipping the unemployed rural youth of poor households with skills, training and technology in specific trades under the TRYSEM programme. This paper critically examines three recent studies of these programmes in a comparative perspective with particular focus on regional differences and draws some inferences for policy. Part I of the paper deals with IRDP and Part II with the TRYSEM programme. The author points out the methodological weaknesses of the three studies and stresses the need for caution in generalising from their findings with respect to the impact of IRDP intervention. In particular, attention has been drawn to the problems involved in mechanically adopting the criterion of 'crossing the poverty line' for assessing the impact of IRDP in the short run and the usefulness of alternative criteria such as income mobility matrices has been illustrated. As for TRYSEM, the author's findings show that the success of the scheme depends critically on the demand for the particular services in which the youth receive training. This, in turn, is a function of the level of state/district per capita income/expenditure and the extent of manufacturing activity. Clearly, the scope for gainful self-employment through TRYSEM in the services sector is limited in the backward regions.||K. Subbarao

04/5/1985- ||special articles||4374367||Historical Roots of Mass Poverty in South Asia A Hypothesis||The contemporary phenomenon of underdevelopment is not a continuation of the traditional economic order of pre-modern times. The patterns of economic organisation and levels of economic performance in the traditional societies of Asia, before they were enmeshed into the international economy created by first the merchant and later the industrial capitalism of western Europe, were significantly different from their contemporary counterparts. In the case of India, the pre-colonial economy in its normal functioning did not generate large groups of half-starving people. The author traces the roots of mass poverty in India, as we know it today, to the new institutional framework of agriculture introduced after 1813 which deprived small holders, both tenants and proprietors, of nearly all their surplus, if it did not actually reduce them to landlessness. Not only the new institutional arrangements, but even the positive developments in agriculture augmented the traditional disparities of India's agrarian society. Thus development of a market for cash crops implied a change in the ratio of non-food crops to food crops until, with increases in population, the output of foodgrains per head of population declined quite sharply. And where irrigation provided the means of increasing productivity, those in control of large holdings tried and increased their holdings, often at the cost of the poorer agriculturists. The all-too-familiar phenomenon of today's mass poverty was thus already an established fact of life by the time population began to increase at a steady pace. Thereafter, given the pyramidal structure of rural society, there was a concentration of the increasing numbers in the lower rungs, until the very poor accounted for a half or more of the rural population.||Tapan Raychaudhuri

25/5/1985- ||special articles||4374447||Treatment Failure in National TB Programme||The carefully planned National Tuberculosis Programme (NTP) was evolved after independence and was widely acclaimed as a comprehensive, realistic, and feasible blueprint for achieving tuberculosis control. However, due to various reasons, the programme has failed to make the desired impact on the problem of tuberculosis. Two types of problems beset the NTP: external organisational and administrative ones and those that are internal to it and determine its prospects of success or failure. While it may be hoped that the external problems faced by the NTP can be eventually solved given enough political will and commitment, the problems internal to the programme are an altogether different story. The former are located in organisational and administrative structures and therefore lend themselves to solution by governmental action. The latter are, however, located in the interface between health institutions and the public and are therefore much harder to solve. It is even doubtful that they have yet been sufficiently understood. For the NTP to succeed, detailed studies of who avails of the facilities provided by the NTP and who does not, and who takes proper treatment through the NTP and who does not, and why, need to be carried out. The present study seeks answers to precisely such questions: What is the normal response of persons in the area selected for the study to illness in general and tuberculosis in particular? Who goes to the district tuberculosis centre, why and how? Who takes proper treatment and who does not, and why?||Kashyap Mankodi,Klass W. van der Veen

In order to successfully carry this out, the African extended family system was attacked, and the nuclear family was encouraged. The secondary economy was heavily taxed, regulated, and wherever possible, undermined. 'Staff associations' or 'workers councils' were promoted among workers to counter the labour movement.

27/4/1985- ||review of women studies, april 1985||4374341||Women's Domestic Work and Economic Activity: Results from National Sample Survey||This paper examines two main hypotheses. First, dividing women's work into three types-(i) participation in the traditionally defined labour force, (ii) domestic work plus activities such as fuel collection, animal care, etc, and (iii) domestic work alone-the authors expect to find that labour force participation will increase with poverty; on the other hand, the performance of domestic work will be negatively correlated with poverty; and among women who do domestic work, the share of those who do only domestic work will, itself be negatively correlated with poverty. Second, the importance of child-care and domestic work will determine which women (by age and marital status) within the household will do which type of work, but will not affect overall labour force participation. Family structure variables such as overall household size, the dependency ratio or the presence of nuclear versus joint families are not, the authors believe, the dominant variable determining female labour-force participation in India.||Gita Sen,Chiranjib Sen

Also, the share of the mill sector in total cloth output has been falling rapidly. Among the composite mills, two-thirds or more of the units are indubitably sick and have been incurring cash losses. Only the powerloom sector and the pure spinning units seem to be doing well. To understand how these developments have come about, it is important to closely examine the changes in the pattern and composition of demand for textiles. A proper evaluation of the determinants of demand is also necessary to make meaningful inferences for the supply side. This is attempted in the first section of the paper. In his analysis of factors relating to the supply side in the second section, the author attempts to explain three important developments: (1) the lack of modernisation in the composite mill sector, (2) the ascendancy of powerlooms over composite mills, and (3) the decline in the market share of the handloom sector. The paper concludes with some comments on the 1985 Textile Policy.||Omkar Goswami

It is necessary, therefore, to simultaneously reduce the propensity to import in these countries. Reducing the propensity to import without jeopardising production is an enormous task which will require a thorough reconsideration of these countries' domestic economic policies both on the demand and the supply side. It will also require phased and planned programmes of structural change in agriculture as well as industry. Such medium to long-term changes in the productive structures of the third world economies are, however, of a very different kind from those which particularly the IMF, through its so-called stabilisation programmes, is in effect currently promoting in the developing countries.||Ajit Singh

19/10/1985- ||special articles||4374948||'Failure of Exchange Entitlements' Theory of Famine: A Response||The sudden collapse into starvation that has been identified with the famine condition, the author argues, is only the final phase of famine when the stigmata of starvation become visual and the victims have collapsed. Famine is not, however, an event marked by the death of the victim. The basic failure in the understanding of famine is the inability to recognise the political, social and economic determinants that mark the onset of the process. We need, therefore, to redefine famine and identify the various factors, political, social, psychological and economic, that operate to keep large classes in the population under continuous pressure. The first part of the essay examines the inadequacy of current definitions of famine and suggests the need to question them. The available literature, including government records on famine as well as codes and manuals of relief administration, reflects the government view that famines are caused by the collapse of the network of social transactions and services, wages and assets, including the varied services and skills of the family unit or the village. The exchange entitlement theory is thus implicit in the literature and consequently does not represent an advance. The second part of the essay is devoted to its consideration. [The first part of this paper was published last week; this is the second and concluding part.]||Amrita Rangasami

It also considers paddy-which is normally taken to be a subsistence crop-as a catalytic agent which successfully exploited the technological changes in the infrastructure and injected dynamism into agriculture. The paper argues that a so-called subsistence crop like paddy can play a progressive role-progressive in the limited sense of enabling the cultivators to produce for the market, accentuating the process of monetisation and making cultivators look upon agriculture as something more than a 'way of life'.||G.

The surplus labour unable to gain entry into the 'modern' sector has been generally found to be absorbed by the rest of the urban economy which has been loosely termed as the informal sector. It is only in the last decade that this sector has become a focus of research in the area of urban labour markets. This paper attempts to trace the conceptual developments in this emerging area of concern and to identify the different policy implications as well as the issues for further research.||Meera Mehta

While the phenomenon of non-registration of many of the recognised House-companies and the reasons for this have been discussed widely, the basis of inclusion of companies in different Houses for the purpose of arriving at House-wide asset figures is not widely known. This assumes importance because of another relatively little known fact that a number of companies which are included in different Houses do not admit inter-connection among themselves. This paper attempts to examine the phenomenon through case studies of the two largest Houses, the Birlas and the Tatas, and by citing important cases belonging to some other Houses. This is done mainly on the basis of studying year-wise registrations, supported by the limited information available in the MRTP Commission's reports and orders issued under the Act. An examination of de-registration under the Act has also been taken up at the end of the paper. This exercise is expected to help in a better understanding of the administration of the MRTP Act as also of the implications of the hike in the asset limit from Rs 20 crore to Rs 100 crore for registration under the Act.||K.

These views ignore the historical documentation on the 'Indian Women Problem' which confronted the colonial office as far back as 1845 when Indian indentureship to Trinidad began. Contemporary research in women's history has revealed that a large proportion of Indian women did make a conscious decision to seek a new life elsewhere. They came as workers and not as dependents. However, the planters saw women as 'unproductive' labour and policies facilitated their exploitation as cheap labour. In addition the hierarchical social structure of the Brahminic-Sanskritic tradition brought about a conflation of interests between migrant Indian men and the colonial capital. Indian women in the colonies did not easily or willingly submit to these designs.||Rhoda Reddock

In this context agricultural labourers from an important target group, and several years ago a separate government agency was set up especially for them, to supervise compliance with the law on minimum wages. A Rural Labour Commissioner based in Gandhinagar heads the organisation, which has its own offices and personnel in every district with a high percentage of landless. Surat in South Gujarat is one of these concentration areas. Presented here are the author's first critical observations, based on intensive field research in three talukas, on the government's claim that the special provision introduced offer effective protection for the very large landless class in the South Gujarat countryside.||Jan Breman

The picture is general and will obviously not apply to all countries of the Third World. The study begins with a general consideration of the strategic role of social technology in economic development and then moves on to look back at the advance achieved in the developed countries in the field of education over the last century. The next section then reviews the expansion in educational enrolment that has taken place in the Third World since 1950. This is followed by a summary indication of the educational distance between the developed countries and the Third World and of the implications of the findings of this study for the educational transition in the Third World.||Surendra J.

27/7/1985- ||review of political economy, july 1985||4374637||The Kaniatchi Form of Labour||Marxist writing on Indian agriculture has, in recent years, tended to concentrate on the question of the mode of production. The development of capitalism in agriculture has been the major focus of the discussion. This emphasis is quite understandable since for over the last two centuries, capitalist forces have had an unprecedented, profoundly transformative impact on the indigenous cultures of millions of people, not only in India but throughout the continents of Latin America, Africa and Asia. To arrive at a conception of the nature of present-day agrarian relations in these areas, therefore, it becomes vital to study the process of this transformation. The debate on the mode of production in Indian agriculture, however, can hardly be said to have contributed to our understanding in this regard. This paper argues that owing to the adoption of a fairly crude Eurocentric model, the debate seems to have got bogged down in a series of false problematics with a number of extremely important questions getting neglected in the process. The paper attempts to chart only a bit of the way in bringing to the fore just one such question. It seeks to highlight the possibility that there could be important differences between the agrarian structures of pre-colonial Indian and feudal Europe quite apart from significant regional variations within the Indian sub-continent itself. Variations which could imply that peasant differentiation and a growth in landlessness may not be the only or even the most important indicators of change following capitalist transformation and that the process may take very diverse forms in different parts of the country. Thus, in many areas the much more significant process may be the qualitative transformation in the relationship between agricultural labourers and their employers. This proposition cannot be fully understood, however, unless we have some conception of the nature of these relations in the immediately pre-colonial period. Although they show a remarkable diversity of form across different regions, there is hardly any detailed study of these relations in even a single region or district in pre-colonial India. The following account drawn from immediately pre-colonial and early colonial Chingleput is an attempt-doubtless still quite fragmentary-towards filling this lacuna.||Mihir Shah

The emergence of political consciousness, unlike trade union consciousness, requires conscious intervention and is related to the totality of social relations and traditions in which the wage-labour relationship is embedded. In India an important aspect to be considered is the implications of the persistence of pre-capitalist relations and institutions like the caste system and the social conflicts arising therefrom in the larger society outside the factory. These problems, related to the interaction between caste and class in the development of the working class, are the concern of this paper. The discussion is centred on the experience of coir workers of Alleppey during the inter-war period.||T. M. Thomas Isaac

07/9/1985- ||special articles||4374799||Education and Inequality||The Constitution is committed to improving the educational level of the Scheduled Castes through preferential policies. The commitment has found expression in a variety of schemes including reservation of seats in educational institutions, lowering eligibility conditions for admission to various courses, scholarship programmes, exemption of fees, free supply of study and dress materials and provision of hostel facilities and other amenities. Underlying the policy of special help is the conviction that the underprivileged should educate themselves for secular employment and move away from stigmatised traditional occupations as well as low-paid agricultural labour, where the bulk of them are employed. The implementation of the preferential policies and the extent to which the Scheduled Castes have actually availed of the benefits are thus matters of considerable significance. This paper focuses on the educational advancement of the Scheduled Castes in Andhra Pradesh.||Uma Ramaswamy

The second, related, problem is that of quality variations, and the practical difficulty of obtaining reliable price quotations of the selected specifications, even in countries with a reasonably good data base. The third problem dealt with here pertains to distortions which arise from the extant ICP treatment of 'comparison resistant services'. Finally, it is suggested that a comparison of relative productivity of labour (in manufacturing industry where productivity is more amenable to statistical measurement) may provide a better method of international comparison.||Arun Ghosh

Deriving its initial stimulus from the growth of regional markets and the development of modern transportation networks after 1860, the khandsari industry drew upon the ample reservoir of cheap, unorganised labour and moneylending debt-linkages to generate significantly high profit margins. The nub of the system was clearly agricultural and the divorce from the means of production characteristic of the factory system proper was never wholly engendered. Instead, the controls exercised by the zamindar-khandsari over labour, land and credit, which provided the basis of the system, were in many respects antagonistic to a model of pure capitalism. What is of interest, however, is the manner in which these strongly non-capitalist features proved assimilable in a general trend towards a more defined capitalistic framework of production. Despite disapproval by both colonial and indigenous governments, the informal sector's resilient competitiveness, in part deriving from proximity to and control over supply of cane as well as the regime of low, seasonal wages, has played a major role in effectively subverting the consolidation of a modern mill industry. One implication of this particular history could thus be that even within a colonial structure it is quite possible for autonomous capitalist development from below to occur. In this instance, the rural informal sector may well succeed in outliving its 'logical' successor.||Simon Commander

09/2/1985- ||special articles||4374060||Garibi Hatao': Can IRDP Do It?||The problem of rural poverty is old and massive. The earlier hope of its mitigation through the percolation of the fruits of general economic growth failed. More land resources could not be made available to the poor. The review of the Integrated Rural Development Programme (IRDP) attempted here shows that the effort to give cattle and other assets too has yielded little. Subsidy appears to be the centre of attraction of the IRDP. It could not be otherwise, the author argues. Eradication of poverty needs a multipronged strategy. The most important, indeed the central, aspect of it has to be the creation of massive wage employment opportunities in rural areas, both on private and public account. Other programmes will then provide opportunities for the able and the enterprising among the poor. It is time resources, organisation and skill are directed to this end, if poverty is to be tackled in the decade to come.||Nilakantha Rath

1/11/1985- ||natural resource utilisation and the agrarian economy||4375012||Towards an Ecological History of India||Human societies are strongly dependent on their resource base. Changes in this base, in technologies and social modes of resource-use and the conflicts which arise over access to resources are important elements of human history. Each of the wave of human populations which colonised India beginning more than a hundred years ago brought with them their own brand of technology and social mode of resource use. The resultant population itself evolved new technologies and modes of resource use. It is possible that many of the taboos, the rules and regulations of a society incorporate the 'ecological wisdom' of the particular civilisation. A rereading of the social history of the subcontinent affords valuable insights into its ecological history as well. For instance, the ecological prudence of the settled pre-Aryan settlements probably came into disastrous conflict with the lack of such understanding among the nomadic Aryan tribes. At least part of the appeal of early Buddhism may have been partly rooted in its taboo on animal sacrifices in a period when the economically necessary animals were already dwindling. It is suggested here that the emergence of caste may have been the response to the saturation of capacity of the land to support human populations at the prevalent level of technology and the strong competition for the resources of the land.||Madhav Gadgil

With vanishing forests, there is a shortage of firewood. An integrated programme for fuelwood production to meet the total requirement of the country is an imperative need. But the implementation of such a programme would pose serious problems. It would be more useful to begin with projects covering specific locations like a village or a block, aiming at making them self-sufficient in fuelwood. The experience gained thereby could help in formulating an overall long-term strategy. This paper discusses the experience of some specific projects in Gujarat state.||V. J. Patel

An attempt is made in this paper to describe some of the salient features of class formation in this region and to provide a periodisation of the process of class conflicts. The author concludes with a brief discussion of the new political direction-in particular, neo-liberal economics and the perspectives it brings to bear on Mediterranean class politics.||James Petras

It discusses the changes in the quantum and quality of feed supply, and the conversion efficiency of milch animal herd due to variations in species and breed composition and the role of Operation Flood. Such an exercise, it is hoped, will provide some insights into some of the major constraints on increasing milk production in India against the background of the much debated Operation Flood strategy.||K.

The financial and foreign exchange markets are no longer hand-maidens of the real economy. They have assumed a life of their own. Unless the basic functions of the financial and foreign exchange markets are restored to serve the real sectors of the world economy, it is unrealistic to expect stability in the foreign exchange and capital markets.||S.
