It argues the case for a State Public Sector to initiate small and medium scale industries. It suggests the criterion of 'forward-biased labour-intensity' to counter the Ricardo effect. It pleads for removal of barriers to the growth of small-scale entrepreneurs. Some 60 million hectares of land, equivalent to one-fifth of the total territory, or two-fifths of the net cropped area, is under pastures, culturable waste, fallow, and the like. Bulk of this land can be developed, within the limits of available technology, into farms or forests. Part of it may be mobilised to settle landless labourers. This paper gives a simple computable criterion for land allocation, under conditions of external economies of forests or similar ecological factors.||Ranjit Sau

Without disputing this approach, this article seeks to redress the balance of concern, and to caution against a too generalised interpretation of emerging trends. For in some of the large and growing cities at least, the mortality pendulum seems to be swinging away from intestinal towards respiratory diseases; however, the causes of this change are not as clear-cut as the current interest in air pollution might suggest.||Radhika Ramasubban,Nigel Crook

While the constraints to successful implementation may in some instances be technical ones, in many other cases they are social in nature. Indeed, the knowledge about energy related technology greatly exceeds knowledge about the problems such technology is meant to solve. The present article is based on 18 months of participatory action research in a village of eastern Uttar Pradesh. It analyses the energy needs of the villagers in relation to their problems and priorities, and presents the experiences of the introduction of several technologies. It is shown that the process of adoption of different technologies has a direct connection with the social and economic condition of the villagers, that determines their needs and constraints and hence the nature and level of their participation. Consideration of factors like poverty, household time budgeting, resource access and social organisation is seen to provide important perspectives for refining renewable energy development strategies in villages.||Varun Vidyarthi

The forces of desertification have gathered momentum within this zone. If this trend is to be reversed a suitable system of mixed farming with emphasis on animal husbandry has to be evolved and practised. In evolving such a programme the choice of appropriate livestock becomes crucial. Where feed is scarce and of low nutritive value larger animals are at a disadvantage because of their greater maintenance requirements. Smaller animals like the goat with lower maintenance needs can cover large areas to gather sufficient nutrients for survival and for minimum production of meat and milk. There are two conflicting views about the goat's role in land use. One view holds that the goat is the major cause of rangeland destruction and soil erosion, and its propogation should be checked. But a contradictory opinion is that the goat is after all a major supplier of animal protein and that since it usually consumes the scrub left-over from the overgrazing by cattle and sheep, it is unrealistic to blame the goat for environmental destruction. The authors, who subscribe to the latter view, discuss why it is ecologically necessary to assign the goat its rightful place in plans for arid and semi-arid regions.||K. A. Shankarnarayan,H. C.

30/3/1985- ||special articles||4374227||Marxist Ideas in Development Economics: A Brief Evaluation||In development economics, as in much of social sciences in general, the most valuable contribution of the Marxist approach is the sense of history with which it is imbued, its focus on the tension between property relations and productive potential in a given social formation, and on the importance of collective action and power in enhancing or thwarting processes of institutional change to resolve that tension, its insistence on bringing to the forefront of public policy debates an analysis of the nature of the state and the constellation of power groupings in civil society, and, of course, its abiding commitment to certain normative ideas on questions of exploitation and injustice. Its processes of reasoning, however, leave much to be desired, with its frequent substitution of convenient teleology for explanatory mechanisms and of a kind of murky institutionalism for rigorous rationale of contractual arrangements, and its failure to base aggregative results firmly on consistent actions of economic agents at the micro-level, ignoring as a consequence incentive compatibility problems, issues of contract enforcement and repetitive transactions, strategic interaction of agents (even with commonality of class interests), the free rider problem in class formation and action, and the disequilibrium dynamics of adjustment paths. Some versions of the Marxist approach also claim too much in the generality of its laws of motion of history, overlooking important historical specificities and localised contexts of culture, geography and demography not always reflecting the technological base. In development planning literature, it also brings a certain legacy of single-minded pursuit of accumulation (along with an autarchic zeal), often slighting acute problems of present consumption, incentives, adjustments, managerial and administrative capacities, ecological balance, and ways of expanding human capabilities beyond improvements on the technological frontier.||Pranab Bardhan

While a minority of the firms either find the policies to be too restrictive or, on the other hand, have benefited from them in their bargaining for a better price, a majority have remained largely unaffected by them. Further, while these policies have been successful in regulating certain quantitative aspects of technology imports (payments, duration, etc), their success in promoting technological development activities within Indian industry has been limited. Technological activities of Indian firms, it is argued here, are far more sensitive to government policies pertaining to the nature of the market and the industrial structure than to those which are explicitly aimed at promoting technology development. The latter policies can be successful only if an industrial environment conducive to innovative activity is simultaneously created. On the other hand, modifications in technology policy alone (such as a liberal payment policy, greater R and D incentives, etc) without necessary changes in industrial policy will fail to infuse technological dynamism into Indian industry.||Ghayur Alam
1/11/1985- ||natural resource utilisation and the agrarian economy||4375012||Towards an Ecological History of India||Human societies are strongly dependent on their resource base. Changes in this base, in technologies and social modes of resource-use and the conflicts which arise over access to resources are important elements of human history. Each of the wave of human populations which colonised India beginning more than a hundred years ago brought with them their own brand of technology and social mode of resource use. The resultant population itself evolved new technologies and modes of resource use. It is possible that many of the taboos, the rules and regulations of a society incorporate the 'ecological wisdom' of the particular civilisation. A rereading of the social history of the subcontinent affords valuable insights into its ecological history as well. For instance, the ecological prudence of the settled pre-Aryan settlements probably came into disastrous conflict with the lack of such understanding among the nomadic Aryan tribes. At least part of the appeal of early Buddhism may have been partly rooted in its taboo on animal sacrifices in a period when the economically necessary animals were already dwindling. It is suggested here that the emergence of caste may have been the response to the saturation of capacity of the land to support human populations at the prevalent level of technology and the strong competition for the resources of the land.||Madhav Gadgil
