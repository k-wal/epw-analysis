An attempt is also made to classify industries on the basis of their export and import intensities. The study brings out decreasing import intensity of exports and import substitution in the use of imported inputs. The export intensity of the selected sample has gone up while import intensity has come down. The export performance of traditional exports, which have low import intensities, is found to be much better than that of non-traditional exports.||Dhanmanjiri Sathe

The reason for this paradox lies in the short-sightedness exhibited by the expert technical opinion which has taken diametrically opposite stances in pre- and post-independence period. It opposed construction of embankments during the British rule, as the colonial rulers desisted spending on rehabilitation operations. While in independent India, the technical opinion, under the political compulsion to do welfare of the people, has wholeheartedly supported construction of embankments and big dams. As a consequence, not only have flood control projects not performed according to the initial expectations but have in fact created a worse scenario.||Dinesh Kumar Mishra

The declining share of cereals in gross cropped area may slow-down and even see reversal in some pockets. Similarly, area expansion under oilseeds will decelerate. India may emerge as a marginal exporter of cereals and cotton, while importing edible oils and pulses. From overall efficiency point of view, agricultural trade liberalisation would benefit India.||Ashok Gulati,Anil Sharma

Subsequently the differences in the use of resources (time and money) between male-headed and female-headed households have been analysed. Finally, the paper explores the relative well-being of the children between the two groups, i e, to what extent female headship influences children's access to social services, and children's actual welfare outcomes, measured in terms of health and education indicators. The results suggest that poverty and female headship are strongly linked in rural Orissa. The results further suggest that the use of resources are significantly different between the two types of households and the comparison of household expenditures indicates that, female-headed households spend relatively less on higher quality food items such as meat, vegetables, milk and other dairy products. Finally the findings show that children in female-headed households are disadvantaged both in terms of access to social services and actual welfare outcomes.||Pradeep Kumar Panda

The social legitimacy of the employers gets eroded when workers, spread across different locations of a company, align to articulate their grievance of relative deprivation. Further deepening of social cleavage within the organisation takes place when the labour leadership takes up programmes to mobilise workers into collective action and remits support for its demands from macro structures like political parties.||Pravin J.

[Spreading across India after the end of the "emergency" in 1977, technological change in the form of the personal computer and offset press revolutionised the newspaper industry. The circulation of daily newspapers in all languages trebled between 1976 and 1992 - from 9.3 million to 28.1 million and the dailies-per-thousand people ratio doubled - from 15 daily newspapers per 1,000 people to 32 per 1,000. Regular reading of something called "news" both indicates and causes change. Expansion of competing newspapers clearly signals the vitality and growth of capitalism: newspapers have owners and owners must have advertisers. The changes of the past 20 years are obvious yet largely unstudied. The essays in this series on the press in the major Indian languages are part of a larger project to map, analyse and try to understand the transformation of the Indian languages newspaper industry.]||Robin Jeffrey

Projects will be defined with a specific focus on the poor, often with the help of donor money channelled through non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This attempt, while well meaning, will invariably be at a micro level with a narrow focus, often ignoring the causes for the existence of poverty in the first place. Band-Aid social work of this variety will certainly improve the living conditions of a number of beneficiaries in the project area. However, poverty is primarily a political issue, caused and maintained by factors of a macro nature and by institutions which function in a specific, political, environment. This paper argues that politics comes prior to poverty, as do institutions. The failure of institutions to address issues of poverty and development are seen here as essentially political failures. Looking back over the last decade, it would be difficult to find a more politicised, violent, ethnically divided, alienated city than Karachi. The paper concludes with the assertion that far-reaching and substantial political and institutional reform, must come first in any attempt to alleviate poverty, particularly in Karachi.||S.

It is not just that Ambedkar's programme envisions the removal of untouchability and with it the undermining of the caste system in public life, but it is also about creating assets among those who have none. This is what brings the moral imperatives of fraternity to the forefront. The assets of the better off are put in the collective pool so that socially valuable assets may be created in sites where there were none. This measure has a moral resonance, for out of this collective pooling new assets are being created. Reservations in the Mandal scheme lack this moral quality. The targeted beneficiaries of Mandal are quite plainly not without socially valuable assets. Further, they are unwilling to merge their existing tangible assets into the collective pool as their express purpose is to convert one kind of asset into another. Caste in the case of the Mandal Commission is an important political resource to be plumbed in perpetuity. The Mandal programme, therefore, is not in the spirit of enlarging fraternity, as the Ambedkar proposals are.||Dipankar Gupta

The ongoing financial sector reforms have focused so far on strengthening bottomlines without taking into account the rural microfinance dimension. Financial market liberalisation has, thus, not yielded results that are effective in improving microfinance transactions. Developing microfinance markets involves removing imperfections that have wrongly been assumed to be policy-induced, hence the ineffectiveness of the present frame of financial market liberalisation paradigm. It is to be realised that these imperfections actually arise from structural and institutional rigidities of microfinance markets. The new institutional economics offers us some insights for removing these imperfections. In the next leg of reforms it is imperative that measures are initiated to address these concerns by properly internalising the nature and content of microfinance and focusing on policy stance, restructuring, design features and governance in the light of perspectives from institutional economics.||K.

The two case studies of organising mat weavers of Kodungallur and potters of Aruvacode in Kerala record and narrate interventions to uplift these sections above poverty level. The Hind Mazdoor Kisan Panchayat by organising 5,000-member strong co-operative society, put an end to starvation, indebtedness and suicide among women mat weavers of Kodungallur, while the Dastkari Haat Samiti, through re-training the highly-skilled potter women of Aruvacode, and marketing their wares to the middle class echelons, prevented the women from succumbing to prostitution. Though these efforts have helped to combat the adverse effects of structural adjustment policy on these two communities, policy support from state and central agencies is equally essential for such interventions to sustain over longer periods.||Jaya Jaitly

How do they combine welfare provisions with the need for efficiency? How do they solve the 'free rider' problem discussed in relation to common property systems? Given that there does not exist a separate class of owners, do the collectives lead to a higher income level for the producers? Do they have a tendency to distribute more as benefits to workers and accumulate less than standard capitalist firms? Can one identify a stratum of managers within the collectives? If so, what are their relations to the workers? The process of market reform in China has led to many observable changes in the role and status of women. Do the collective villages show any differences in the matter of evolving gender relations? Are collective villages better able to take environmental considerations into account? Overall, do producers fare better in the collective villages as compared to the usual post-Reform villages? These are some of the questions explored in this study of four villages. After briefly introducing the villages and their history, the paper analyses different aspects of the functioning of collective villages. The paper is published in two parts. This is the first part; the second part will appear next week.||Dev Nathan,Govind Kelkar

Two noteworthy research results are: (1) income benefits from canal waters prima facie were more than the supply cost of such waters throughout the period 1980-81 to 1992-93 and (2) the supply cost of canal irrigation tended to rise much faster than the income benefits, probably because hidden costs of corruption and sheer inefficiencies in canal development and administration soared in the above period of general erosion in ethics and public accountability.||B.

The confrontation directly pitted the unions against the government and that too the central government which could deploy the full might of all the institutions of state power to smash the workers' resistance. This would have a decisive influence on the nature and outcome of the struggle. Secondly, even though generalised and massive, the strike was above all an affair of the leadership. Beyond a few symbolic agitations, the Joint Action Front made no serious attempt to draw the mass of workers into the struggle. This again would have an important effect on the distribution of power between the two sides during the course of the struggle. Thirdly, the strike remained, by and large, extremely peaceful despite the highly aggressive attitude of the government in the later stages of the conflict. Finally, this was the first time in the country that a collective leadership coming from different political horizons was leading such a large strike and for such a long period. From start to finish, the workers' representatives manifested a remarkable degree of unity and allowed no dissensions to trouble the organisation and co-ordination of the struggle. The paper is divided into two parts. Part I, published last week, analysed the two settlements that were concluded by the management and unions in 1973 and 1978 in the five Bangalore companies and BHEL - settlements that lay at the heart of the 1980-81 strike. Part II, below, is devoted to a review of the strike in all its multiple and varied aspects.||Dilip Subramanian

Broadbasing occurs alongside and often in response to the challenge of the opposite process of marginalisation, the two processes operating at the expense of each other. Has the process of marginalisation, with the base of the power structure becoming narrower and society consequently less democratically and intensely polarised, a process which was dominant under colonial rule given way to a broadbasing process in the 50 years after independence? This paper takes a serious and discursive look at the operation of the two processes, in Indian society, focusing on the changing social, political and economic status of dalits over the period.||M.

Though there is a large volume of literature on the subject, there is a dearth of systematic reviews of the extant literature. This paper is an attempt in that direction. It presents a classificatory scheme using two dimensions - level of analysis (nation, industry and firm) and types of variables used to explain competitiveness. The implicit and explicit research questions addressed and issues related to definition, measurement and sources of competitiveness at various levels are also discussed. It is suggested that given its complexity an eclectic approach combining different schools of thought and using multiple measurement schemes would be appropriate for doing research on competitiveness.||Shekhar Chaudhuri,Sougata Ray

It reveals that there was a marked acceleration in the growth rate of agricultural output in India during 1980-83 to 1992-95 as compared with the earlier periods. Furthermore, agricultural growth had become regionally much more diversified. The period 1980-83 to 1992-95 was also characterised by important cropping pattern changes away from coarse cereals towards rice and wheat cultivation on the one hand and towards oilseeds on the other. Finally, the 1980s also witnessed a widespread acceleration in per male agricultural worker productivity in many Indian states. If sustained, high labour productivity growth is likely not only to result in higher wages but also to trigger growth in the non-agricultural sector through input output and consumption linkages.||G.

The culmination of the GATT process occurred in circumstances which were altogether unexpected when negotiations commenced in 1986. The collapse of the Eastern Bloc and the disintegration of the Soviet Union produced a deterioration, during the period of the negotiations, in the confidence of advocates of planned socialism in terms of state regulation of the economy which was to prove decisive. This erosion of confidence permitted a comprehensive victory for the promoters of global free trade, in the context of capitalism, at Marrakech in 1994. The paper scrutinises how a combination of events unlooked for in December 1993 have altered the state of affairs reflected in the Marrakech Agreement. The paper also investigates implications (discipline research and multinational enterprise operations) for international business in the context of states, abandoning command approaches to managing their economies, under encouragements from the Bretton Woods Institutions, and expecting that, in a relatively short period, unfettered market mechanisms would produce results comparable to even modest indices posted by OECD countries. The perceived failure of market reforms to meet objectives of growth and the inability of transition processes to lift these countries to competitive levels has begun to shift the balance of argument away from the advocates of global free trade back towards the supporters of state intervention at the micro-economic and enterprise levels. Taking the example of India, the paper explores prospects for multinational enterprise with respect to the state in the altering circumstances of international business.||Frank L. Bartels,Barry H.

At what costs to women's welfare do such demographic outcomes occur? The existing structural nature of women's work (domestic as well as non-domestic) has severe built-in hazards for women's health (reproductive and otherwise) which no amount of first rate quality of care and/or access to health services alone can deal with. Focusing on Tamil Nadu, the author argues in addition that a demographic model state need not necessarily be a reproductively safe place.||Padmini Swaminathan

Part of the problem lies in the tensions between the conventional and emerging definitions of ecology and development. Overcoming the etymological confusion by attempting to understand the interrelationship in and through the experience of communities may help in the contouring of a sub-discipline of environmental sociology.||Sujata Patel

Decisions to choose various options of privatisation strategies are influenced by the economic and political imperatives of these countries. This study attempts to examine the relationship between the privatisation, external debt factors and domestic economic factors, using a cross-sectional analysis of 28 major privatisors in the developing world. The analysis suggests that while privatisation proceeds and external debt are positively related, there is no such relationship between privatisation and indebtedness. This reflects the institutional dimension of external debt stock which seems to be more politically sensitive than the actual indebtedness. The study does not find any evidence to suggest that neither has privatisation of state-owned enterprises impacted any change in the government consumption nor has an increase in FDIs resulted in an increase in domestic investments.||Narayanan Edadan

Domestic financial liberalisation needs to be accompanied by sound macro-economic policies and strengthened legal, regulatory and supervisory structures. While speculation has a legitimate role to play in signalling distortions in macro-economic and financial frameworks, speculation can also be destabilising and lead to 'inappropriate' contagion. An international 'circuit-breaker' mechanism, to complement IMF-based mechanisms that are already in place to deal with currency crises once they have occurred, is urgently required to curb 'inappropriate' contagion effects and their heavy economic and socio-political costs.||Francis X.

Because the Bharatiya Janata Party is not yet a factor in that part of the country, the already preponderant regional parties have assumed even greater importance in India's new electoral equation. Their support is essential if the legislative coalitions that have become necessary in the post-Congress era are to be viable. Even though Andhra Pradesh had a delinked election with no assembly contest in 1996, and Tamil Nadu's voters chose legislators to represent them in Madras and New Delhi, the campaigns were related. In the two south-eastern states regional parties stressed the primacy of local issues against subordinate wings of the Indian National Congress whose policies were tied to Delhi.||Arthur G. Rubinoff

Such groups would prefer to depend on their elected candidates bound by party discipline to follow their dictates. Unfortunately, this is today the reality in West Bengal, which has otherwise made good progress on the rural front. The only viable alternative is to pursue a protracted rural campaign of various interlinked facets. This should encompass literacy, health, land literacy and participatory planning and development. Such an effort is certain to generate confidence, articulation and the capacity of the people to press for their rightful dues. The emerging democratic awareness and power of the rural electorate will boost this process of empowerment and self-reliance substantially. Some space has also now been created by those in power, maybe for motives of their own, for starting such a campaign. Socially motivated voluntary organisations and political groups with faith in secularism and democracy should grasp this opportunity.||Subrata Sinha,Arun Ghosh

It would follow if the economy always had full employment of resources, but it does not; hence the two perceptions of efficiency are not synonymous. This has important implications. It may be efficient for a country to carry on with what appear to be inefficient activities. A number of propositions which are argued on grounds of efficiency, e g, loss-making units should be weeded out, reservation of items for cottage industries should go, can in fact be criticised precisely on the grounds of efficiency, since all of them entail output losses. Recognition that ours is not a full-employment economy implies that policy measures have to be scrutinised for their short- and long-term effects on output and employment and this may dictate, for the production of any good, the use of a combination of production techniques rather than one 'efficient' technique, a combination of activities rather than one 'efficient' activity. Planning alone provides the framework within which such assessments can be made.||Prabhat Patnaik

The rise in the openness ratio began in the mid-1980s and accelerated in the 1990s, following the depreciation of the currency in 1990-91. However, the 1997-98 budget and the current exchange rate policy, it is argued here, will lead to a stagnation in the openness ratio, unless corrections are made. A bolder investment programme and a fairly large depreciation of the currency would lead to a sustainable growth in excess of 9 per cent. Without such correction, growth is likely to fall after a year to less than 6 per cent and would bring back the situation of a payments problem that characterised the late 1980s. Of course, the current orthodoxy of the policy-makers and the RBI would have to go.||Sebastian Morris

Some describe it as neo-classical economic theory of politics, others specifically as a political cousin of structural adjustment, setting out political preconditions for its success. And to yet others it is a cocktail of the Marxist concept of the state without its class analysis and with the Liptonian theory of urban bias thrown and blended with neo-classical economics. Whatever the viewpoint the fact remains that the new political economy provides a powerful justification for the structural adjustment package of the World Bank. This paper presents an outline of the ideas emanating from this school of thought and attempts a political-economic analysis of new political economy itself.||Biplab Dasgupta

Whereas the earlier variants of the 'new' populism associated with the views of Marcuse and Fanon, expressed fears about alienation involving the estrangement from an 'authentic' peasant selfhood, in the third-worldist discourse which the more recent and postmodern variants of the 'new' populism share with 'new' right, this innate 'peasant-ness' is represented ideologically as the recuperation of a cultural 'otherness'/'difference' that can now be celebrated.

The sacrifice of monetary independence resulting from large intervention pursued with a view to preventing significant real appreciation has brought to the fore the government's commitment to a sustainable level of current account deficit. But the conduct of exchange rate policy - whether to use the exchange rate as an instrument or a target - has turned increasingly complex. Consistently preventing the exchange rate from settling at levels justified by market forces may emerge as a major stumbling block in furthering the process of liberalisation of capital account transactions. This paper is an attempt to place in proper perspective the various issues relating to 'target' and 'instrument' for the external sector while focusing on the relevant strategic policy options that would be available to the country as it integrates further with the international financial system.||Sitikantha Pattanaik

Further, the methods of wage data collections seem to have attracted negligible attention of researchers and the government agencies collecting and publishing such data. The attitude of indifference also gets reflected in the manner the problem of minimum wage determination is handled. Though the labour unions have done commendable work on this issue, they have not been able to get a proper minimum wage determined. Therefore, understanding various sources of wage data and their respective methods of collection is important to get qualitatively reliable data.||Jayanti Ghanekar

The proficiency level of fourth and fifth grade children in basic arithmetic and Hindi was assessed and children's performance on these tests examined against their socio-economic background, and the characteristics of their village and school. How well or poorly the village school functions is determined by (a) how modernised a village is, particularly how well it is connected to the city, and (b) the percentage of SC/ST population in the village. The wider implication of this result is that development of rural infrastructure such as road networks may be an important factor in improving the quality of elementary school education.||Rashmi Sharma

Some the reform rhetoric can be shown openly to confront the interests of the mass of agricultural producers. This paper describes and summarises the results of research into agrarian development carried out over two decades in northern Tamil Nadu. Mediocre growth, the stagnation of yields and persistent instability of output are all confirmed. Social differentiation continues apace, accentuated by the relations of environmental plunder surrounding the use of water. To an important extent small-scale producers persist in their dependence upon traders' credit for agricultural and non-agricultural production. While agriculture is mired in a 'green reaction', de-agrarianisation and rural industrialisation have provided a mass of livelihoods to the lower agricultural castes which constitute the small peasantry and agricultural labour force, resulting in an expansion of household forms of production dependent on commercial finance and on (black) investment capital migrating out of urban areas. These opportunities are heavily screened by class, caste and gender. Its technological backwardness and its use of children prised from school into the hardly paid household labour force suggest that this rural industrialisation will not be a base from which a classic industrial capitalist labour process will emerge.||Barbara Harriss-White,S.

While existing firms would like to discourage entry, new firms are attracted into an industry precisely by the success of incumbents in keeping out competition and earning super-normal profits. It is shown in this paper that a prospective entrant can choose between various modes of entry. The entrant also has to decide on the scale of entry. While entry is a one-shot proposition, the process of entry itself and the various considerations that determine entry have dynamic connotations that can be ignored only at the peril of endangering the long-term viability of the new enterprise.||Anindya Sen

This article fills the remarkable gap in our knowledge of the history of the Indian atomic energy commission, especially the period between 1947 and the early 1960s, when the AEC's shift from a civilian development-related enterprise to a national security agency was made. However, rather than see the atomic energy enterprise as an independent state activity, the article treats atomic energy as a key part of the larger effort of the postcolonial state to create a new site of legitimacy for itself after independence. Driven by the state's crisis of ideology, it is argued that the history of the AEC is embedded within a time/space dialectic captured by the terms urgency and secrecy which reinforce each other in an unstable dynamic and which cannot be sustained.||Itty Abraham

Our results show that the liberalisation process has led to significant decline in the protection of Indian industry - the average value of Effective Rate of Protection (through tariff) has declined from around 90 per cent in the pre-reform period to around 30 per cent in 1995-96, and only 44 per cent of India's imported commodities are subject to at least one type of non-tariff barriers. In spite of the drastic changes in the import regime, there is no significant change in the composition of India's import basket. This is probably due to the fact that there is no change in the dispersion of tariff rates among industries during the reform period. In the post-reform period, the higher growth in India's export has been due to the contribution of the agriculture sector. In fact, there has been no significant change in the composition of the export basket during the reform period, while manufacturing products accounted for almost the entire growth of export during the 1980s. Further, the trade policy changes have had no significant impact on export. There is no sign of improvement in external competitiveness after the reform period and most of the increase in India's export is explained by shift in our markets toward Asian countries.||Rajesh Mehta

In the context of inequitable gender relations within households, poor women may have access to employment, but still be sharply subordinated, so that they have very little control over their earnings. Women's control of their earnings or of credit cannot be awarded to them by development agencies. Such control over resources is intimately connected with gendered power relations and with perceptions of gendered needs and rights. To illustrate the ways in which gender, caste and class participate in constituting the political economy of poverty in rural Tamil Nadu, the author focuses her discussion on three different contexts, in each of which the organisation of labour and the agency of poor women themselves are differently constructed - that of impoverished pallar women who are scheduled caste and landless agricultural labourers, that of poor middle-caste soliya vellalar women who work as bonded labourers in the synthetic gem-cutting industry and that of low-income middle-caste women beneficiaries in a major government income-generating programme.||Karin Kapadia

However, with the realignment of the forces (not necessarily located in the village) and the subsequent changes in the institutional arrangements such primary co-operative societies may face disintegration.

The NGO Forum in Rome comprising community representatives from various countries strove to challenge these assumptions in its declaration and other documents.||Anuradha Mittal,S. Anantha Krishnan

Though a complex mechanism theoretically purports to justify a greater representation of justifiable needs of both centre and states, in praxis, the devolution mechanism does not guarantee the fulfilment of desired ends. If the pursuit of desired ends through complexity borders on futility, then a more simple mechanism cannot do worse. This paper attempts to highlight the virtues of a simple mechanism that is broadly targeted at the aspirations of the federal constituents of our polity. It further seeks to contribute to the debate on fiscal management and argues for its incorporation as one of the criteria in the devolution schemes.||K. S. R. V. S. Chalam,Rajiv Mishra

The first refers to the prominence of the Jain and Vaishnava banias from at least the 16th century, in the emergence of manufacturing industry to the present-day. The short-term continuity pertains to the other group which became involved in the industrial transition during this century - petty producers, local artisans who were the first to change to engineering and profited from state-sponsored industrialisation. These continuities contrast markedly with the changing perspectives on entrepreneurship in the last 30 years.||Hein Streefkerk

The immediate task before the government of India is to make the acceptance of product patent applications in pharmaceuticals and agricultural chemicals legal and transparent and then begin the more comprehensive legislative exercises. Given the time constraint in complying with a majority of the TRIPS provisions within two years or so, it would seem prudent not to lose any more time and to begin the process of weighing all the available options immediately.||Jayashree Watal

In the absence of concrete political agendas, these influences get further reinforced and elections have become a means of establishing a phoney social dominance by caste groups. This is also why no one pattern of alignment of social forces is clearly discernible as consistent.

This article traces the concept of 'zhongua minzu' (Chinese nation) through history. At face value and taken out of the international context, minzu conveys the cognitive meaning of ethnic group today, with no connotation of popular sovereignty at all. However, it is the time agency and international circumstances of its first usage that determines the real connotation of the word. It was first used by the Han Chinese elites in the 1870s. The newly loaned minzu internally denoted the Han Chinese as a minzu that aimed to topple the Manchu regime and establish a more capable self-government. Externally it denoted China as a minzu aiming at restoring its respectable position in the world if not as the central country. This double connotation has given rise in modern times to a chronic endless and hopeless debate over the definition of minzu. The linguistic fact that a word for minzu was absent until the turn of the century, and its muddling connotation since then shows that China was not and did not conceive itself as a nation until it faced the power of western nations. If one of the criteria of a nation is that it recognises its equals in the world, China did not reach the perception until the late 19th century.||Zhang Haiyang

It also extends over the entire range of science critiques that seek to reinterpret the canons of mainstream modern science. However, these critiques of science, it is argued here, cannot simply be pushed into the political left or right nor can they be interpreted as pro- or anti-science - which is what Sokal's position finally amounts to.||Gita Chadha

These industries are characterised by an insufficient and hazardous use of labour and an excessive use of natural resources. Thus the issues of betterment of working conditions inside the industries and environmental protection outside it, are closely interlinked. Occupational health is an essential part of working conditions, since most of the health problems occur among workers exposed to unhealthy substances and dangerous situations. The awareness regarding the interlinkages of workers' interests, occupational health and environmental protection is increasing, as reflected in some recent initiatives and legal interventions.||Mukul

This requires trust, and/or collective provision of 'real services'. Bangalore's smaller engineering and electronic firms work for larger firms, but some develop their own products. Engineers and workers are quality-conscious; innovation is market-led. Entrepreneurs are often too suspicious to co-operate or share information, but there are productive friendships and consortia. Firms benefit from 'real services'. What are the bases and limits of trust? Can 'real services' make up for lack of trust?

These alternatives are: continuation of current trend of 3.5 per cent growth in per capita income; acceleration of growth in per capita income to 5.5 per cent; raising the entire poor above the poverty line ('Non-poor India'); and ensuring that every one is well fed in terms of calories ('Well-fed India'). The results show that with an anticipated rise in the growth rate of per capita income in India during 1991 to 2020 from 3 to 5.5 per cent per annum, there would be an appreciable acceleration in the growth rate of demand for foodgrains. These results are contrary to the assertion of some scholars who have argued that with an expected acceleration in per capita income to 5 to 5.5 per cent during the coming decades, there would be a decline in demand for foodgrains and hence that India's prospects for wheat and rice exports are bright. Our view is that Herculean efforts would be required for stepping up food production even if domestic demand is to be satisfied from domestic sources.||G. S. Bhalla,Peter Hazell

The policies, drawing on international experience, are informed by the following objectives: (i) to enhance the flexibility of banks to respond effectively to changing circumstances (volatility); and (ii) to ensure the sustainability of the restitution of public sector banks. The measures discussed include maintaining a higher capital adequacy ratio; facilitating restructuring of the sector by formulating an exit and privatisation policy; implementing stricter and more transparent accounting and disclosure norms; and enhancing rule-based supervision.||Urjit R.

The party mandarins in Beijing appeal to nationalist sentiments while pursuing a political-economic regime that derives its inspiration from the example of Singapore.

Instead, political parties in India, as manifested by the past three general elections, are going to be increasingly 'representative' in character, increasingly focused upon narrower interests along various lines of social and economic cleavages that divide Indian society. The shape of national politics in this context will be determined by fluid coalitional politics between these various actors. In such a situation, it is to the BJP's advantage to maintain its identity as predominantly 'hindutva' party with its stronghold among the upper caste and middle class groups. However, the need to enter into power sharing arrangement will continue to have a moderating impact on its policies and make it more responsive to the aspirations for social and economic betterment of the backward and dalit groups.||Pramod K.

Here the 'other' is examined as it occurs in anthropology and philosophy, primarily through Levinas and Derrida.

No discussion of such measures can possibly be carried out without regard to their distributional implications. The liberalisation-cum-structural adjustment package, the author argues, brings about four different kinds of distributional shifts: from workers to capitalists, from petty producers and small capitalists to large capitalists, from domestic capitalists to foreign capitalists and - what has perhaps attracted the least attention - from entrepreneurs to rentiers or from producing interests to financial interests.||Prabhat Patnaik

Any political solution to the CHT conflict would require a fundamental change in the arrogant and neocolonial attitude of the donors, a willingness to completely alter the nature of aid itself based on an explicit choice for structural support to the poor, and a recognition of the right to self-determination of indigenous peoples.||Janneke Arens

The government had waxed eloquent in 1995-96 about rice and wheat emerging as major export commodities and about the proper use of 'surplus foodgrains'. But even before 1996 was out we were compelled to arrange emergency import of two million tonnes of wheat. This has exposed the vulnerability of the economy in terms of food security and highlighted the importance of supply-side factors in sustaining price stability. While inflation cannot be controlled by a one-point programme of controlling money supply, containing the extent of monetisation of the budget deficit is critical to sustaining price stability. In this context the abolition of Ad Hoc Treasury Bills from April 1, 1997 has been hailed as a systematic change, but in the ultimate analysis what matters is not the mechanics of monetisation of the budget deficit as the political will to observe fiscal prudence.||N.

Yet the stock market now bear a picture gloomier than in 1992. The real differences between the conditions in 1992 and those in 1996 lie in the long-term factors of capital market growth. Viewed from this perspective, there are compelling reasons to believe that the emergence of certain adverse systemic factors have much to say about the recent slump than the macro-economic paradigms.||Basudev Mohanty

It shows that since the income benefits of rural transformation are related more with asset ownership than with employment shares, employment diversification, though necessary, is not sufficient for income diversification among the rural poor. While occupational diversification does contribute to income stability, its role in income enhancement is severely constrained by lower wage rates in rural occupations where the poor groups participate the most.||R.

None of the departmental exercises - so-called district plans, block level planning or area level programmes - has been able to ensure genuine planning from below, sensitive as such planning should be to complex local-specific problems and felt needs of the people. In the above context, the newly constituted Kerala State Planning Board resolved to initiate a People's Campaign to empower panchayats and municipal bodies to draw up Ninth Plan schemes within their respective areas of responsibility. It is the Planning Board's expectation that 35 to 40 per cent of Kerala's Ninth Plan will consist of schemes formulated and implemented from below. While it is, of course, premature to attempt an assessment of the ongoing People's Campaign, the all-round support that the Campaign has received suggests some observations regarding its far-reaching implications.||T.

22/2/1997-28/2/1997||commentary||4405111||Marathi: Big Newspapers Are Elephants||Mumbai and Pune represent two facets of Marathi journalism. Pune's Sakal, in spite of its recent shift towards new marketing and management strategies, still remains imbued with idealism of the nationalist period and its emphasis on wide-ranging local-level reporting. On the other hand, in Mumbai's highly segmented market, smaller newspapers claim popularity due to their unpredictable mix of business sense, technical mastery and cultural intimacy. [Spreading across India after the end of the 'emergency' in 1977, technological change in the form of the personal computer and offset press revolutionised the newspaper industry. The circulation of daily newspapers in all languages trebled between 1976 and 1992 - from 9.3 million to 28.1 million and the dailies-per-thousand people ratio doubled - from 15 daily newspapers per 1,000 people to 32 per 1,000. Regular reading of something called "news" both indicates and causes change. Expansion of competing newspapers clearly signals the vitality and growth of capitalism: newspapers have owners and owners must have advertisers. The changes of the past 20 years are obvious yet largely unstudied. The essays in this series on the press in the major Indian languages are part of a larger project to map, analyse and try to understand the transformation of the Indian-language newspaper industry.]||Robin Jeffrey

Most of the existing literature on rural labour markets have the skewed distribution of land and the predominance of annual crops as their behavioural assumptions. It is argued here that the theories developed on these assumptions are unable to explain the labour market behaviour in rural Kerala where agriculture is characterised by the predominance of small holdings and perennial tree crops. These two characteristics have substantially altered the structure of the labour market from the stylised model and hence theories based on the dominant norm fail to explain the labour market behaviour in Kerala.||M.

This raises the question of distributive justice and also whether such a tax system conforms to the preamble of our Constitution which professes social and economic justice. The paper, therefore, suggests that while the new dividend tax system may be retained, it should be combined with the levy of TDS at modest rates on the shareholders' dividend income to meet the canons of social and economic justice.

Partly it can be attributed to the party leadership's ability to accurately perceive the class alignments taking place in the state and elsewhere in response to rapid economic change and the accompanying media revolution, and to factor a combination of 'caste thesis' and 'class thesis' into their political calculations.

It impacts on every other type of malaria as human migration is an important factor in malaria transmission. Through this case study of an outbreak of malaria in a migrant group in Vellore district, the epidemiological, social and human problems of migration malaria are examined. The study highlights the importance of migrants in disease transmission. It also raises social and ethical issues in the health care of migrants and highlights the need to consider migrants as vulnerable, high risk people with unique needs. There is a need for a clear policy on migrants and their health care.||Madhukar Pai,Anand Zachariah,Winsley Rose,Samuel Satyajit,Santosh Verghese,Abraham Joseph

Part of the answer lies in the advance of Gujarati capitalism and the changes in ownership of the newspapers. [Spreading across India after the end of the 'emergency' in 1977, technological change in the form of the personal computer and offset press revolutionised the newspaper industry. The circulation of daily newspapers in all languages trebled between 1976 and 1992 - from 9.3 million to 28.1 million and the dailies-per-thousand people ratio doubled - from 15 daily newspapers per 1,000 people to 32 per 1,000. Regular reading of something called 'news' both indicates and causes change. Expansion of competing newspapers clearly signals the vitality and growth of capitalism: newspapers have owners and owners must have advertisers. The changes of the past 20 years are obvious yet largely unstudied. The essays in this series on the press in the major Indian languages are part of a larger project to map, analyse and try to understand the transformation of the Indian-language newspaper industry.]||Robin Jeffrey

Although education plays a crucial role in providing the possibilities for personal growth and independence, the importance of cultural norms, values and customs in determining the life choices and physical and mental well-being of women cannot be denied. An empowering education has to address itself to the needs and competencies of women in their daily lives. The significant value of education also lies in its ability to alter women's consciousness and lives from within so that they question these traditions and practices and bring about a change in their everyday lives by asserting themselves through a positive understanding and appreciation of their identities as women.||Meenakshi Thapan

It can also allege 'shortages' and even 'crises' which are fertile ground for malpractices in the provision of connections, connected load and (legal and illegal) electricity consumption. They also 'justify' the invitations to private power with all the associated benefits, particularly in the case of foreign private power. This paper analyses Karnataka's power sector - the present situation and trends of electricity demand and supply, the Karnataka Electricity Board's financial problems, the important policy and technical milestones in the development of Karnataka's power sector and the winners and losers from the pattern of development of this sector - and charts the way forward.

The main argument of the paper is that India avoided a peso type of crash by following a policy of gradual liberalisation of capital flows, and prudent exchange rate policy, and getting the sequencing of reforms right. Though, in terms of generalisability, this study has the limitation of just two cases, when combined with the results of previous studies, there are some important lessons to be learnt for economic reforms in developing countries.||Ganesh Kumar Nidugala

The most significant and controversial amendments were effected between 1981 and 1983, when the Congress government in power through KHAM strategy aimed to end the patidar hegemony in the co-operative sector. The opposition to the amendments sprang more from the recognition of this agenda than from any ideological affiliation to co-operative ethics. The co-operative bosses belonging to patidar community took the war to the courtrooms and had the thrust of the amendments threatening their power base, severely diluted.||S. J. Phansalkar

There are, broadly speaking, two categories of disaster - the natural (floods, fires, earthquakes) and the manmade (riots, wars, industrial accidents). Both types result in considerable violence against 'the people', especially in an environment that is impoverished, post-colonial, and served by an entrenched bureaucracy. This paper, which partly addresses the subalternist historiographer's problematic of how 'the moment' of people's suffering is to be captured in the writing of history, explores connections between these seemingly independent classes of calamity - the natural and the denatured. It does so by examining three sorts of disaster narrative - the official, the popular and the academic - each of which interprets an underlying nominal/natural kind divide differently. More specifically, the paper uses the philosophical concepts 'nominal and natural kind' to analyse narrative strategies in women's accounts of disaster so that the beginnings of a 'feminist critique of bureaucracy' might emerge, not merely out of academic theorising, but from within the discourse of those who have survived incredible assaults and yet lived to 'tell the tale'.||Rukmini Bhaya Nair

Data on FDI approvals in the post liberalisation period have been compared with data on capital formation by local industry during the same period. From an analysis of the current level of dominance by foreign firms, the likely impact of fresh FDI has been analysed and assessed at the sectoral level. The findings are likely to have relevance at least over the next five years. While the thrust of the paper is on whether there is a basis for the fear that foreign firms will gradually wipe out indigenous industry, some other issues related to FDI are also examined. These include trends in technical collaboration approvals (compared with FDI), sectoral levels of exports and trade balance and dividend outgo (compared with know-how and royalty payments).||S.

Public distribution of foodgrain should be singly directed only for securing food to the poor at low prices. For this purpose targeting of PDS should be area specific and group specific. Allocation for welfare schemes such as the mid-day meals scheme and for payment of wages in kind to labourers in rural employment schemes should continue. An increased role for the private sector in the foodgrain market will provide the right signals to farmers in deciding their cropping patterns in line with the emerging demand for different agricultural commodities. As for relative foodgrain price stability, it is more sustainable and less costly to seek to achieve it through expansion of irrigation and technology, especially to the less developed regions. PDS is not the instrument for this purpose.||R. Thamarajakshi

The JFM resolution assumes symmetrical relationship between the government and the local institutions. Yet, state governments and their forest departments still refrain from conceding legal status to forest protection committees, retain their right to dissolve them and appropriate a large share of forest produce. A case study of six villages from three districts in south-west Bengal also reveals chequered results regarding maintaining inter-village equity in the apportionment of forest land, meeting the forest-based needs of adjacent non-FPC villagers, and exploration of the commercial potential of the non-timber forest produce.||Binay Kumar Pattnaik,Sumana Dutta

Assessment of India's Economic Reforms||This preliminary and partial assessment of India's orthodox reforms initiated in mid-1991 shows a mixed outcome so far: overcoming the liquidity crisis, the economy has broadly got back to the growth charted in 1980s, with a modest yet statistically significant slower growth of the secondary sector. The investment-GDP ratio has improved, however, with unfavourable compositional changes; social sector spending has been maintained as allocations for defence and economic services were cut. The fiscal correction has been mainly due to a reduction in public investment and expenditure. Industrial recovery is partial and uneven; and public sector output and profitability improved despite the policy shocks, though their sustainability seem suspect.||R. Nagaraj

For that purpose it evaluates the minimum efficient scale (MES) of operation of the cement industry in India. Findings of the empirical exercise show that cement market of the country can accommodate a reasonably good number of producers and hence is capable of providing a competitive environment if firms were to operate at MES level. However, an assessment of the installed capacity of the cement plants indicates that many cement companies with single or multiple plants tend to have firm sizes much beyond the prescribed level by the estimated MES.

In addition to the existing inequity in landholdings, the inequity in access to groundwater further widens the skewness in assets and income distribution. The food security and equity was well provided by dug well irrigation. The failure of dug wells, shift to high water-high value crops and policy instruments like soft loans to sink wells and zero marginal cost for electrical power to lift groundwater, disturbed the equity in well irrigation, and paved the way for the use of expensive technologies for rapid harness of groundwater. As a result, the dug-cum-borewell and borewells contributed to inter- and intra-generational inequity, even though they increased the overall growth in agriculture.||N. Nagaraj,M. G. Chandrakanth

The arguments mobilised by the contending parties, and the judgment passed, reveal, despite their differences in interpretation of sacred Hindu texts, a common concern with the moral prescriptions of Hindu religious tradition for man-woman sexual relationship. Nowhere are women, an equally important segment to be affected by the practice, seen articulating their position. Instead the reformist discourse recasts the amorous image of the woman in the Vallabhacharya tradition into virtuous, duty-abiding wife whose sexuality continues to be controlled by patriarchal familial norms.||Usha Thakkar

The proposed removal of quantitative restrictions on agricultural imports will further hasten the undermining of our food security. The heavy subsidies that advanced countries give to their producers means that Indian farmers will face grossly unfair competition as imports are allowed. The ability of the agricultural sector to finance increasing food imports through agro-export earnings is dubious given the existing and projected trends of prices of cereals relatively to non-cereal agro-export commodities.||Utsa Patnaik

However, contrary to the results obtained in the Indian scenario, a comparison of the pre-green revolution period with the post-green revolution one reveals a clear trend of reduced instability in the case of Bangladesh. At the inter-regional level also, instability seems to have gone down. Despite these favourable features the country is yet to achieve food self-sufficiency.

No comments have been made on the last part because it was felt that the limited space given to the labour market problems in transition economies was simply not sufficient for an informative assessment of these problems. In its first part, on Labour and Development Strategy, the WDR 1995 fails to articulate and discuss a model of the labour market specifically applicable to developing countries. It does not give adequate emphasis on development policies that might improve the living standard of workers in the third world. Some basic aspects of the labour market scene in developing countries, like segmentation, surplus labour and the informal sector have just been treated as additions to the story, instead of occupying the central stage. The implicit model of a homogeneous labour market leads to an overemphasis on the formal sector, which constitutes only a small part of the labour market in developing countries. As in textbook models of a homogeneous labour market with an inelastic supply of labour, the conditions for an improvement of wages are seen to be increasing the demand for labour in the formal sector. Hence the WDR's emphasis on export growth, particularly of manufactured goods. With a vast reservoir of surplus labour in agriculture and the informal sector in the developing world, the key to raising workers' earnings in these economies is to increase the supply price of such labour - and this can only be done with policies that augment labour productivity in agriculture. In many cases overemphasis on export growth might detract from this objective. Other aspects of export growth and labour incomes dealt with in this article include the continued importance of exports of primary commodities for developing countries, and the impact of the fall in the terms of trade of such products in the 1980s. The evidence of globalisation leading to growing inequality in the distribution of incomes between regions and within individual countries or regions is also discussed. Finally, the impact of labour regulation on both the formal and the informal sectors in developing countries is taken up.||Dipak Mazumdar

How do they combine welfare provisions with the need for efficiency? How do they solve the 'free rider' problem discussed in relation to common property systems? Given that there does not exist a separate class of owners, do the collectives lead to a higher income level for the producers? Do they have a tendency to distribute more as benefits to workers and accumulate less than standard capitalist firms? Can one identify a stratum of managers within the collectives? If so, what are their relations to the workers? The process of market reform in China has led to many observable changes in the role and status of women. Do the collective villages show any differences in the matter of evolving gender relations? Are collective villages better able to take environmental considerations into account? Overall, do producers fare better in the collective villages as compared to the usual post-Reform villages? These are some of the questions explored in this study of four villages. After briefly introducing the villages and their history, the paper analyses different aspects of the functioning of collective villages. [The paper is published in two parts.

Already some initiatives on divestment in public sector enterprises have been taken by the Indian government. The key issues revolve around the degree of restructuring the state enterprises or industries to be privatised, the speed and timing of such restructuring and the methods used for transfer of ownership from public sector to private sector. This paper examines the lessons of the British privatisation programme for India since reform of the energy sector is a key economic objective in India. The discussion focuses on privatisation of electricity supply industry a key sector in economic development in India. Privatisation of British Electricity Supply Industry was preceded by radical changes in the industry structure and restructuring of the firms in the industry and was accompanied by a tight regulatory framework intended to promote efficiency and competition.||Douglas Wood,Devendra Kodwani

In particular, two aspects that have become perennial sources of controversy are: the disintegrated componentwise approach, and the near-subjective assignment of weights to factors determining the horizontal shares of states. Given that the reduction of horizontal fiscal inequity is an important objective of the federal transfers, the study proposes a fiscal behavioural model to help identification of the criteria and derive weights for deciding the revenue shares, based on their observed degree of association with the fiscal balance of states. The approach is illustrated by estimating the model using panel data.||J. V. M. Sarma

By the same token, the transition to a simple, transparent and rational system cannot take place in one move, but will have to be comprehensively visualised and implemented in a phased manner. The Tenth Finance Commission's alternative scheme of devolution, the author argues, can be used as the starting point for putting through a process of rationalising centre-state transfers, sequenced in an orderly manner between 1997-98 and 2001-2002.||S.

The efficacy of the alliance's mobilisational tactics was further enhanced because of popular resentment against Congress. Moreover, Congress' local networks have disintegrated due to political complacency disabling it from resisting the Sena's effective door-to-door campaigning.||Sikata Banerjee

Most importantly, planning is meaningless unless it is firmly linked to implementation. The planner's best course of action is to set the objectives of his plan, and use these to determine policy initiatives. As events occur, and development takes place, new initiatives may be called for, so that the original objectives continue to be pursued. Without such a process of continuous readjustment, in response to a changing environment, the original objectives stand little chance of being realised. After suggesting how the urban planning process should be conducted, the author concludes with the changes in law that are required.||Shirish B. Patel

It impinges on the process of structural change, underpinned by transformation from an agricultural to an industrial economy, with critical implications for growth, equity and poverty. In this context, structural adjustment or 'liberalisation' policies, symbolising measures to stimulate structural change by reorganising production, focus on shifting emphasis from the state to the market and forging closer interaction between the national (domestic) and the global economy. In this respect, the goals and implications of structural adjustment policies (SAP)/liberalisation have to be redefined and reassessed in the context of globalisation. The thrust of this paper is on analysing the relationship between SAP/liberalisation, globalisation and reduction of poverty. Globalisation cannot be divorced from the historical setting of the relationship between developed and developing countries. It requires the functioning of free markets, with minimal intervention and poses critical questions on the autonomy of domestic policies. Under these conditions, it is essential to reconceptualise the consequences of SAP for poverty. This demands first locating the origin of SAP and their impact on growth and poverty and secondly, measures to resolve socio-economic inequality and poverty (pre- and post-SAP). This unfolds in the setting of social exclusion of the poor. The policies embrace alleviation, reduction and eradication of poverty through the use of one or more instruments including (a) growth-based strategies (including the rate and composition of growth and its 'trickling down', (b) institutional measures, exemplified by changes in property relations and land reforms coupled with decentralisation, (c) poverty reduction strategies, including social welfare and employment programmes. The analysis unfolds the key lessons for reducing poverty through micro/sectoral, macro and international policies in the frame of liberalisation and globalisation. The paper is divided into five sections: Section I provides the context of globalisation, structural change and poverty; Section II focuses on SAP/liberalisation, globalisation and poverty; Section III is a brief analysis of SAP/liberalisation, globalisation and African development; Section IV makes an in-depth analysis of SAP/liberalisation, globalisation and poverty using the Indian case. Section V explores some lessons/insights of the analysis.||Sumit Roy

To irrigate one crop hectare with canal water it costs the nation Rs 2,277 in fixed and variable expenses in 1992-93. Barely 5 per cent of this cost was recovered through irrigation fees levied on farmers. What is more disturbing is that, net of price inflation, marginal cost of canal irrigation tended to rise by 8 per cent per annum in recent years. Is this huge cost rise (in real terms) a genuine phenomenon, or merely indicative of large-scale corruption in irrigation department? With marginal cost of irrigation increasing phenomenally, would canal irrigation remain an economically viable proposition at all?||B. D. Dhawan

A critique of this brand of history writing should start from a simple question: what is its politics, and whose interests may it serve? But as this paper demonstrates, the subalternist approach can be criticised on many other grounds as well, including its lack of a coherent theory of how subjectivity and agency are constructed within a concrete historical context, and its refusal to acknowledge how global capitalist forces are being worked out on the ground, including the generation of 'differences'.||Vinay Bahl

Two basic considerations have to be kept in mind in view in designing financial liberalisation policy strategy. For one, while financial reform is aimed at eliminating distortions in the financial markets induced by government intervention, it does not necessarily create perfect credit markets which were not perfect even before government stepped in. Financial reform has therefore to be built on the initial conditions, which make for a different profile of the reform with emphasis on its positive aspects of filling the gaps in human and information capital. Financial reform should be interpreted only as withdrawal of government intervention for economic reasons; but it is essential for prevention of breach of prudential rules for protection of investors' interests. Thus, greater the degree of financial liberalisation greater is the need for strengthening regulatory framework.||Deena Khatkhate

The last Vidhan Sabha elections in Uttar Pradesh present a case where political parties attempted precisely this separation. Although each political party constructed the electorate as a collection of ethnic blocs, and sought to expand its vote share by targeting certain blocs and ignoring others, the identification of the ethnic 'other' that has in the last few years proved a highly successful strategy in UP politics was conspicuously absent. Understanding the considerations that led to this shift in UP may prove useful in illuminating the possible ways in which caste and religion may affect the trajectory of Indian politics at the national level. This article argues that, unfortunately, the conditions that led to the moderation of political party behaviour in UP are not stable. An analysis of the election strategies of each of the principal parties or groups of parties reveals that for all parties, except the Congress, the incentives towards moderation were a product of immediate circumstances that are likely to change, rather than structural conditions that can be expected to endure.||Kanchan Chandra,Chandrika Parmar

But more recent literature also considers relative farm prices that would provide incentives for technical change. This has been reinforced by the present policy in the wake of reforms that reduce protection to trade and industry for advocating its prime role for technical change. This paper therefore develops a more comprehensive framework of price and non-price factors for studying this change. Among the non-price factors it separately considers government investment in R and D, inputs, credit, rural literacy, and marketing and banking infrastructure density in addition to land reforms.||Bhupat M.

This event is an important example of the grammar in which colonial ideologies were deployed, and suggests, contrary to nationalist academic thinking, a direct lineage between the colonial and the post-colonial state.||Nira Wickramasinghe

The real reason is the government's anxiety to reassure members of the Congress Party and the Janata Dal that the government will put an end to judicial activism which has been causing many of them much embarrassment.

Romantic reconstruction of India, uncritically appropriated and internalised by our anti-imperialist elite, has marked and also marred the project of literary history of our country. The history of post-war Marathi writing begins with a watershed in Maharashtrian cultural history, beginning with anti-brahmin riots following M K Gandhi's assassination and ending with Second Five-Year Plan of Nehruvian social welfare-oriented capitalism.

Price Heterogeneity and 'Real' Inequality in Rural Karnataka||This paper, based upon a case-study of three villages in Karnataka, uses qualitative and quantitative data to study whether households within the same market pay different prices for identical goods. It is found that not only are unit prices for food heterogeneous, but that the poor pay more for the same goods than the rich. This is because liquidity constraints force poorer households to purchase goods in small quantities and consequently subject them to quantity premiums. Quantity effects are directly estimated by OLS and IV for prices, and are found to be particularly acute for dals. Household specific index numbers are calculated to measure this price heterogeneity and are used to adjust nominal incomes to real values. It is found that Gini coefficients of real incomes are between 12 per cent and 23 per cent greater than those for nominal incomes depending upon the price index used. An econometric analysis of the determinants of prices shows that incomes are negatively correlated with prices, as is family size, but that the amount of land owned shows a positive relationship. All of these effects are consistent with a quantity premium explanation.||Vijayendra Rao,A. C. Komala

The focus of intervention, it is argued here, is incorrectly placed on the migrant worker.

The government and the Reserve Bank of India have, in turn, responded with an expansionary credit policy led by significant reductions in the CRR. The empirical findings of this paper contest the position of industry. They show that for a significant part of the first half of 1996-97 the credit market has witnessed lack of demand for credit, as opposed to credit rationing by banks. It is unlikely, therefore, that isolated (expansionary) credit policies, ushered in through the use of CRR and SLR, will work. The focus should rather be on the real sector: transparent and reform-oriented policies which would boost the confidence of both consumers and producers.||Sumon K. Bhaumik,Hiranya Mukhopadhyay

However, doubts have been raised about the sustainability of growth in production as well as efficacy of the PDS to ensure food security. Alternatively, a strategy has been advocated to ensure foodgrain self-sufficiency by enhancing access to land/natural resources. This paper examines some of the more recent trends in production and demonstrates that the yield based growth in food production has taken place in most states including dryland regions; that the diversification is a larger process that had already set in before liberalisation; and that the shift from oilseeds to foodgrain production is essential for economic sustainability of dryland farming.||Amita Shah

The implications of this lay, decisively, in opening the area of knowledge of production methods, in general, to human enquiry. This was given the (refurbished) name of technology, and accorded a central role in the dialectics of capitalism. Later, the 1931 International Conference on the History of Science and Technology formulated key ideas in the dialectics of technology. This groundwork laid the basis for substantial advances in the history of technology in the subsequent years. However, inadequate theoretical elaboration of the institutional forms in which technological knowledge is commercialised has created the space for the growth of arcane theories of technology, which attribute to it a malignant agency. The emotive appeal of these theories is indicative of the reality: the results of the post-1945 scientific and technological revolution are expressed in forms structured by a transnational-dominated world economy.||Nasir Tyabji

Balance of payments crises, rather than being exogenous shocks, could well be the equilibrium outcome of maximising behaviour by rational agents faced with a fundamental inconsistency between monetary and exchange rate policies. The longer the delay in bringing about such consistency between monetary, fiscal and exchange rate policies, the higher will be the potential costs of an eventual adjustment when ultimately faced with the inevitable regime collapse.||M.

Does the willingness to pay for local information in the form of newspapers indicate the growth of a 'genuine public sphere' of which more and more Oriya-speakers see themselves as part? [Spreading across India after the end of the 'emergency' in 1977, technological change in the form of the personal computer and offset press revolutionised the newspaper industry. The circulation of daily newspapers in all languages trebled between 1976 and 1992 - from 9.3 million to 28.1 million and the dailies-per-thousand people ratio doubled - from 15 daily newspapers per 1,000 people to 32 per 1,000. Regular reading of something called "news" both indicates and causes change. Expansion of competing newspapers clearly signals the vitality and growth of capitalism: newspapers have owners and owners must have advertisers. The changes of the past 20 years are obvious yet largely unstudied. The essays in this series on the press in the major Indian languages are part of a larger project to map, analyse and try to understand the transformation of the Indian language newspaper industry.]||Robin Jeffrey

The five-year period under NEP (1991-96), however, did not accelerate the process. Rather there is some indication for its failure on the balance of trade front. Contrary to the claim made in certain pro-NEP circles, exports did not pick up, while imports accelerated. Due to its failure to control domestic inflation vis-a-vis India's trading partners, the real (effective) exchange rate of the rupee appreciated in spite of substantial depreciation of nominal (effective) exchange rate.||Prabirjit Sarkar

Pump irrigation markets have emerged as a robust and dominant irrigation institution serving as virtually the sole powerhouse energising north Bihar's new-found agrarian dynamism. Three criteria used to assess the performance of water markets were depth, breadth and efficiency. Their impacts were analysed on four variables: cropping intensity, cropping patterns, labour use and crop yields. Water markets in the region have developed a high level of depth and breadth, but they are highly inefficient, generating large monopoly rents for pump owners. These produce powerful negative distributive impact; however, the output impact of monopoly pricing by water sellers is negligible because of the price inelasticity of irrigation demand explained by its high marginal productivity. The overall impact of water markets are highly beneficial; crop yield and cropping intensity achieved by water buyers are far superior to non-irrigators, and in many cases even in comparison to pump owners; cropping patterns used by water buyers are nearly the same as of pump owners; finally, operation of water markets substantially expands labour use in agriculture. Abysmal power supply environment is a major barrier to fuller development of equitable water markets; equally critical to promoting efficiency and equity in these markets are the prices and supply of diesel for pumping.||Tushaar Shah,Vishwa Ballabh

Central to the notion of educational democracy in South Africa is the idea that democracy entails, and should enhance, greater participation. This paper critically examines educational policies in South Africa regarding the moves toward greater democracy and participation in the education system. It does so by examining key policy texts focusing on key recommendations pertaining to school governance, highlighting, inter alia, the tensions and contradictions in them and the different and contradictory notions of participation. The paper argues that current policy texts do not necessarily enhance greater participation and may, in fact, contradict moves towards equity and that policy development in South Africa essentially represents a compromise between white privilege and black redress that is precarious and likely to rupture.||Yusuf Sayed

The answer therefore is not to look towards the state but at different ways of approaching and defining democracy and development.||Niraja Gopal Jayal

It is in line with this mindset that the UGC Pay Review Committee, 1997, makes its recommendations. Its exertions in pursuit of the goal of drawing the 'best talent' to teaching follow along three axes: (a) diminish teaching to a rung below bureaucrat, banker, executive and other educated services; (b) require spiralling eligibility, but take away every necessary input to excellence; and (c) regulate and regiment teachers into subservience.||T.

But, looking at agricultural policy from the perspective of social objectives, this paper finds that there is no blanket case for removal of all interventions. Instead, in case of market failure such as national food security and food security for the poor, intervention in the market is necessary and desirable. Also, there is no need for removal of ceilings on land ownership to achieve maximisation of agricultural output and employment.||S. N. Mishra

The confrontation directly pitted the unions against the government and that too the central government which could deploy the full might of all the institutions of state power to smash the workers' resistance. This would have a decisive influence on the nature and outcome of the struggle. Secondly, even though generalised and massive, the strike was above all an affair of the leadership. Beyond a few symbolic agitations, the Joint Action Front made no serious attempt to draw the mass of workers into the struggle. This again would have an important effect on the distribution of power between the two sides during the course of the struggle. Thirdly, the strike remained, by and large, extremely peaceful despite the highly aggressive attitude of the government in the later stages of the conflict. Finally, this was the first time in the country that a collective leadership coming from different political horizons was leading such a large strike and for such a long period. From start to finish, the workers' representatives manifested a remarkable degree of unity and allowed no dissensions to trouble the organisation and co-ordination of the struggle. The paper is divided into two parts. Part I, published this week, analyses the two settlements that were concluded by the management and unions in 1973 and 1978 in the five Bangalore companies and BHEL - settlements that lay at the heart of the 1980-81 strike. Part II, to appear next week, is devoted to a review of the strike in all its multiple and varied aspects.||Dilip Subramanian

This thesis, in our view, has no historical evidence, let alone internal logic. Contradictions of world capitalism will be, we argue here, a major driving force to global events. At the centre of world capitalism the real economy grows at an annual rate of 3 per cent, while the value of private property in stock markets rises about three times as fast. The disproportionately expanding personal wealth raises consumption and tells upon savings. On the other hand, the financial capitalists set the interest rate relatively high. The net result of these two factors is a low rate of capital accumulation. So the economy slows down. With a stagnant centre of world capitalism the third world countries will face a greater degree of financial instability and turmoils of underdevelopment. This would be a major fountainhead of tension in the days ahead. Social unrests based on religion or culture might be their manifestations, but not the basic cause of troubles. Keynesian economics, in effect, has abdicated its position by drawing a 'Lakshman rekha' of short-run around itself. This paper tries to resue it from that involuntary exile.||Ranjit Sau

Leverage and Corporate Performance||This paper examines the relationship between the debt-equi'ty ratio and performance for a large sample of Indian firms. Extant theory posits a positive relationship between leverage and economic performance and this relationship is found to be valid in western economies. Analysis of data for a very large and representative sample of Indian firms, however, reveals the relationship for these firms to be significantly negative. The structure of capital markets in India, where both short-term and long-term lending institutions are predominantly government-owned, is postulated to account for the finding of this relationship, and it is shown that corporate governance mechanisms which work in the west will not work in the Indian context unless the supply of loan capital is privatised.||Sumit K.

This can be attributed, in significant part, to the lack of interest in listening to them. More specifically, the agenda for change is frequently predetermined, on the assumption that women's interests are homogeneous throughout various communities. The grass roots development ideology questions this agenda, looking to satisfy those needs that are expressed by the women themselves. Where such development does not focus explicitly on restructuring unequal gender relations, many feminists disagree with the utility of this methodology for women's empowerment. This paper seeks to address the potential for accommodating feminist concerns with grass roots development ideals, since the benefits of a collaborative relationship are significant for women's development.||Archana Kalegaonkar

[Spreading across India after the end of the 'emergency' in 1977, technological change in the form of the personal computer and offset press revolutionised the newspaper industry. The circulation of daily newspapers in all languages trebled between 1976 and 1992 - from 9.3 million to 28.1 million and the dailies-per-thousand people ratio doubled - from 15 daily newspaper per 1,000 people to 32 per 1,000. Regular reading of something called 'news' both indicates and causes change. Expansion of competing newspapers clearly signals the vitality and growth of capitalism: newspapers have owners and owners must have advertisers. The changes of the past 20 years are obvious yet largely unstudied.

Dialects which do not have script and lack state patronage to develop literature in print get impoverished. Education is one such vital area where this language hierarchy is strengthened in name of preserving national integration.||Sadhna Saxena

Stock index futures, a multi-role derivative product which is more complex and interesting as a financial instrument, find the rationale for its use in the so-called efficient market hypothesis which argues that stock prices are random walks. This paper examines the role played by index futures, and argues that the Bombay Stock Exchange is significantly efficient, thereby justifying the introduction of stock index futures.||Sumon Kumar Bhaumik
15/3/1997-21/3/1997||special articles||4405175||Changing Composition of Employment in Tertiary Sector: A Cross-Country Analysis||A large number of countries all over the world - mostly developing and some industrial - are at present implementing stabilisation and structural adjustment programmes. Deregulation and more particularly globalisation in many of these countries are likely to enhance the share of foreign trade in the economy. The domestic production structure is also likely to undergo radical change in the process of deregulation. All these would have a significant effect on the employment structure. The authors' empirical results suggest that these will affect not only the overall share of the tertiary sector in total employment but will also change the employment structure. The implications of these changes deserve careful analysis.||B. B. Bhattacharya,Arup Mitra

The thinkers of new thoughts are outnumbered by and shut out from, the packagers of these thoughts who must reconcile this new and dangerous knowledge to the demands of the system. And those who implement official agenda become a generation removed from the original reasoning behind the agenda. An underclass of learners has ceased to believe, and is dropping out, reverting to its earliest programming and is finding realistic ways of looking after itself.||Peggy Mohan

In contrast, the most backward castes who constitute a large number among the backwards, have yet to assume a distinct identity. The OBCs like yadavs, kurmis, gujars are assertive today but the MBCs still do not have a forum for articulation of their grievances. These developments have led to conflict between the dalits and the OBCs on the one hand, and sharpened identities between the dalits and the MBCs on the other.||Sudha Pai,Jagpal Singh

The paper notes that the current programme of bringing down the fiscal deficit ratio to 4 per cent of GDP is expected to lower inflation and interest rates in the economy and strengthen the sustainability of fiscal balance in the long run. Given the greater integration between domestic and world financial markets, fiscal deficit assumes a great deal of significance as a policy instrument of maintaining the viability of external sector. In the context of growth, fiscal adjustment needs to be tailored to reverse the declining trend in infrastructure investment and basic social services and to improve the productivity of resources use in public sector.||M.

A focus on the Muslims of a disturbed and high-profile place such as Delhi in 1947-48 allows us to recover something of the suppressed memories of Partition and Independence, at the same time as we ask something about the way in which the history of these events has been written up.||Gyanendra Pandey

But in course of time, Muslims have changed their character and are not at par with their Hindu counterparts in demanding and offering dowry both in heavy cash and kind. The increasing incidence of dowry deaths among Muslims is only a reflection of its growth in the society as a whole.||Nehal Ashraf

Dependence on imports is risky because crop failure or other problems in the oil world may have serious repercussions on the domestic situation. The emphasis in the coming years should be on developing new sources, palm oil cultivation, minor oilseeds and the processing of by-products of agricultural crops.||P. C. Bansil

This is an important aspect of the food economy, for an evaluation of state intervention must consider not only the welfare of its targeted beneficiaries but also the welfare of households without access to the PDS but who may nevertheless be affected if the working of the PDS has a bearing on the open market.||Pulapre Balakrishnan,Bharat Ramaswami

The old upper caste-backward caste divide has remained and, in fact, has intensified; it is reflected in the bitterness of the competiton between the BJP and its upper caste voters, on the one hand, and the SP and its yadav and other backward caste voters, on the other hand. However, the scheduled castes are no longer pawns and the Muslims are no longer on the sidelines.||Paul R. Brass

Life in cities can be made more livable if sincere measures are taken to preserve the green belts ('lung spaces'), grow more trees, and improve public transportation. By polluting the existing sources of water supply, cities are resorting to excessive withdrawal of groundwater causing land subsidence in some of the big cities, and transportation of water from longer distances with enormous cost. Water conflicts are also arising because of competing uses like irrigation, industrialisation and urban water supply.||C. Ramachandraiah
