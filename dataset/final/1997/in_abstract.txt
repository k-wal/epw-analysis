The study analyses the role of watershed development programme on the sustainable development of dry region and to what extent participation of local resource users helps in sustaining the development temporally.||N.

Projects will be defined with a specific focus on the poor, often with the help of donor money channelled through non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This attempt, while well meaning, will invariably be at a micro level with a narrow focus, often ignoring the causes for the existence of poverty in the first place. Band-Aid social work of this variety will certainly improve the living conditions of a number of beneficiaries in the project area. However, poverty is primarily a political issue, caused and maintained by factors of a macro nature and by institutions which function in a specific, political, environment. This paper argues that politics comes prior to poverty, as do institutions. The failure of institutions to address issues of poverty and development are seen here as essentially political failures. Looking back over the last decade, it would be difficult to find a more politicised, violent, ethnically divided, alienated city than Karachi. The paper concludes with the assertion that far-reaching and substantial political and institutional reform, must come first in any attempt to alleviate poverty, particularly in Karachi.||S.

How do they combine welfare provisions with the need for efficiency? How do they solve the 'free rider' problem discussed in relation to common property systems? Given that there does not exist a separate class of owners, do the collectives lead to a higher income level for the producers? Do they have a tendency to distribute more as benefits to workers and accumulate less than standard capitalist firms? Can one identify a stratum of managers within the collectives? If so, what are their relations to the workers? The process of market reform in China has led to many observable changes in the role and status of women. Do the collective villages show any differences in the matter of evolving gender relations? Are collective villages better able to take environmental considerations into account? Overall, do producers fare better in the collective villages as compared to the usual post-Reform villages? These are some of the questions explored in this study of four villages. After briefly introducing the villages and their history, the paper analyses different aspects of the functioning of collective villages. The paper is published in two parts. This is the first part; the second part will appear next week.||Dev Nathan,Govind Kelkar

Two noteworthy research results are: (1) income benefits from canal waters prima facie were more than the supply cost of such waters throughout the period 1980-81 to 1992-93 and (2) the supply cost of canal irrigation tended to rise much faster than the income benefits, probably because hidden costs of corruption and sheer inefficiencies in canal development and administration soared in the above period of general erosion in ethics and public accountability.||B.

Some the reform rhetoric can be shown openly to confront the interests of the mass of agricultural producers. This paper describes and summarises the results of research into agrarian development carried out over two decades in northern Tamil Nadu. Mediocre growth, the stagnation of yields and persistent instability of output are all confirmed. Social differentiation continues apace, accentuated by the relations of environmental plunder surrounding the use of water. To an important extent small-scale producers persist in their dependence upon traders' credit for agricultural and non-agricultural production. While agriculture is mired in a 'green reaction', de-agrarianisation and rural industrialisation have provided a mass of livelihoods to the lower agricultural castes which constitute the small peasantry and agricultural labour force, resulting in an expansion of household forms of production dependent on commercial finance and on (black) investment capital migrating out of urban areas. These opportunities are heavily screened by class, caste and gender. Its technological backwardness and its use of children prised from school into the hardly paid household labour force suggest that this rural industrialisation will not be a base from which a classic industrial capitalist labour process will emerge.||Barbara Harriss-White,S.

These industries are characterised by an insufficient and hazardous use of labour and an excessive use of natural resources. Thus the issues of betterment of working conditions inside the industries and environmental protection outside it, are closely interlinked. Occupational health is an essential part of working conditions, since most of the health problems occur among workers exposed to unhealthy substances and dangerous situations. The awareness regarding the interlinkages of workers' interests, occupational health and environmental protection is increasing, as reflected in some recent initiatives and legal interventions.||Mukul

There are, broadly speaking, two categories of disaster - the natural (floods, fires, earthquakes) and the manmade (riots, wars, industrial accidents). Both types result in considerable violence against 'the people', especially in an environment that is impoverished, post-colonial, and served by an entrenched bureaucracy. This paper, which partly addresses the subalternist historiographer's problematic of how 'the moment' of people's suffering is to be captured in the writing of history, explores connections between these seemingly independent classes of calamity - the natural and the denatured. It does so by examining three sorts of disaster narrative - the official, the popular and the academic - each of which interprets an underlying nominal/natural kind divide differently. More specifically, the paper uses the philosophical concepts 'nominal and natural kind' to analyse narrative strategies in women's accounts of disaster so that the beginnings of a 'feminist critique of bureaucracy' might emerge, not merely out of academic theorising, but from within the discourse of those who have survived incredible assaults and yet lived to 'tell the tale'.||Rukmini Bhaya Nair

The JFM resolution assumes symmetrical relationship between the government and the local institutions. Yet, state governments and their forest departments still refrain from conceding legal status to forest protection committees, retain their right to dissolve them and appropriate a large share of forest produce. A case study of six villages from three districts in south-west Bengal also reveals chequered results regarding maintaining inter-village equity in the apportionment of forest land, meeting the forest-based needs of adjacent non-FPC villagers, and exploration of the commercial potential of the non-timber forest produce.||Binay Kumar Pattnaik,Sumana Dutta

For that purpose it evaluates the minimum efficient scale (MES) of operation of the cement industry in India. Findings of the empirical exercise show that cement market of the country can accommodate a reasonably good number of producers and hence is capable of providing a competitive environment if firms were to operate at MES level. However, an assessment of the installed capacity of the cement plants indicates that many cement companies with single or multiple plants tend to have firm sizes much beyond the prescribed level by the estimated MES. Thus the possibility of erecting strategic barrier by some of the producers to forestall competition may not be ruled out.||Gopinath Pradhan

In addition to the existing inequity in landholdings, the inequity in access to groundwater further widens the skewness in assets and income distribution. The food security and equity was well provided by dug well irrigation. The failure of dug wells, shift to high water-high value crops and policy instruments like soft loans to sink wells and zero marginal cost for electrical power to lift groundwater, disturbed the equity in well irrigation, and paved the way for the use of expensive technologies for rapid harness of groundwater. As a result, the dug-cum-borewell and borewells contributed to inter- and intra-generational inequity, even though they increased the overall growth in agriculture.||N. Nagaraj,M. G. Chandrakanth

To irrigate one crop hectare with canal water it costs the nation Rs 2,277 in fixed and variable expenses in 1992-93. Barely 5 per cent of this cost was recovered through irrigation fees levied on farmers. What is more disturbing is that, net of price inflation, marginal cost of canal irrigation tended to rise by 8 per cent per annum in recent years. Is this huge cost rise (in real terms) a genuine phenomenon, or merely indicative of large-scale corruption in irrigation department? With marginal cost of irrigation increasing phenomenally, would canal irrigation remain an economically viable proposition at all?||B. D. Dhawan

Pump irrigation markets have emerged as a robust and dominant irrigation institution serving as virtually the sole powerhouse energising north Bihar's new-found agrarian dynamism. Three criteria used to assess the performance of water markets were depth, breadth and efficiency. Their impacts were analysed on four variables: cropping intensity, cropping patterns, labour use and crop yields. Water markets in the region have developed a high level of depth and breadth, but they are highly inefficient, generating large monopoly rents for pump owners. These produce powerful negative distributive impact; however, the output impact of monopoly pricing by water sellers is negligible because of the price inelasticity of irrigation demand explained by its high marginal productivity. The overall impact of water markets are highly beneficial; crop yield and cropping intensity achieved by water buyers are far superior to non-irrigators, and in many cases even in comparison to pump owners; cropping patterns used by water buyers are nearly the same as of pump owners; finally, operation of water markets substantially expands labour use in agriculture. Abysmal power supply environment is a major barrier to fuller development of equitable water markets; equally critical to promoting efficiency and equity in these markets are the prices and supply of diesel for pumping.||Tushaar Shah,Vishwa Ballabh

Water conflicts are also arising because of competing uses like irrigation, industrialisation and urban water supply.||C. Ramachandraiah
