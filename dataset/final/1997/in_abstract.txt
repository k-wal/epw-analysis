Projects will be defined with a specific focus on the poor, often with the help of donor money channelled through non-governmental organisations (NGOs). This attempt, while well meaning, will invariably be at a micro level with a narrow focus, often ignoring the causes for the existence of poverty in the first place. Band-Aid social work of this variety will certainly improve the living conditions of a number of beneficiaries in the project area. However, poverty is primarily a political issue, caused and maintained by factors of a macro nature and by institutions which function in a specific, political, environment. This paper argues that politics comes prior to poverty, as do institutions. The failure of institutions to address issues of poverty and development are seen here as essentially political failures. Looking back over the last decade, it would be difficult to find a more politicised, violent, ethnically divided, alienated city than Karachi. The paper concludes with the assertion that far-reaching and substantial political and institutional reform, must come first in any attempt to alleviate poverty, particularly in Karachi.||S.

How do they combine welfare provisions with the need for efficiency? How do they solve the 'free rider' problem discussed in relation to common property systems? Given that there does not exist a separate class of owners, do the collectives lead to a higher income level for the producers? Do they have a tendency to distribute more as benefits to workers and accumulate less than standard capitalist firms? Can one identify a stratum of managers within the collectives? If so, what are their relations to the workers? The process of market reform in China has led to many observable changes in the role and status of women. Do the collective villages show any differences in the matter of evolving gender relations? Are collective villages better able to take environmental considerations into account? Overall, do producers fare better in the collective villages as compared to the usual post-Reform villages? These are some of the questions explored in this study of four villages. After briefly introducing the villages and their history, the paper analyses different aspects of the functioning of collective villages. The paper is published in two parts. This is the first part; the second part will appear next week.||Dev Nathan,Govind Kelkar

Environmental Risk Assessment||An assessment of environmental risk in Ahmedabad city, using innovative new methods, shows that environmental problems are beginning to pose a high risk to the health of its citizens and appropriate measures need to be taken, in terms of planning future urban growth, if the situation is not to deteriorate.||C.

Part of the problem lies in the tensions between the conventional and emerging definitions of ecology and development. Overcoming the etymological confusion by attempting to understand the interrelationship in and through the experience of communities may help in the contouring of a sub-discipline of environmental sociology.||Sujata Patel

Some the reform rhetoric can be shown openly to confront the interests of the mass of agricultural producers. This paper describes and summarises the results of research into agrarian development carried out over two decades in northern Tamil Nadu. Mediocre growth, the stagnation of yields and persistent instability of output are all confirmed. Social differentiation continues apace, accentuated by the relations of environmental plunder surrounding the use of water. To an important extent small-scale producers persist in their dependence upon traders' credit for agricultural and non-agricultural production. While agriculture is mired in a 'green reaction', de-agrarianisation and rural industrialisation have provided a mass of livelihoods to the lower agricultural castes which constitute the small peasantry and agricultural labour force, resulting in an expansion of household forms of production dependent on commercial finance and on (black) investment capital migrating out of urban areas. These opportunities are heavily screened by class, caste and gender. Its technological backwardness and its use of children prised from school into the hardly paid household labour force suggest that this rural industrialisation will not be a base from which a classic industrial capitalist labour process will emerge.||Barbara Harriss-White,S.

These industries are characterised by an insufficient and hazardous use of labour and an excessive use of natural resources. Thus the issues of betterment of working conditions inside the industries and environmental protection outside it, are closely interlinked. Occupational health is an essential part of working conditions, since most of the health problems occur among workers exposed to unhealthy substances and dangerous situations. The awareness regarding the interlinkages of workers' interests, occupational health and environmental protection is increasing, as reflected in some recent initiatives and legal interventions.||Mukul

Already the reverberations of their agonies, not to speak of their spreading ecological apocalypse, itself the emanation of corporate greed, are felt beyond the region.||Frederic F. Clairmont

There are, broadly speaking, two categories of disaster - the natural (floods, fires, earthquakes) and the manmade (riots, wars, industrial accidents). Both types result in considerable violence against 'the people', especially in an environment that is impoverished, post-colonial, and served by an entrenched bureaucracy. This paper, which partly addresses the subalternist historiographer's problematic of how 'the moment' of people's suffering is to be captured in the writing of history, explores connections between these seemingly independent classes of calamity - the natural and the denatured. It does so by examining three sorts of disaster narrative - the official, the popular and the academic - each of which interprets an underlying nominal/natural kind divide differently. More specifically, the paper uses the philosophical concepts 'nominal and natural kind' to analyse narrative strategies in women's accounts of disaster so that the beginnings of a 'feminist critique of bureaucracy' might emerge, not merely out of academic theorising, but from within the discourse of those who have survived incredible assaults and yet lived to 'tell the tale'.||Rukmini Bhaya Nair

By reviving the unirrigated wheat varieties in the Malwa region, a group of activists and farmers is attempting to enrich subsistence farming and delink food production from commercial and industrial interests.||Rahul,Jacob Nellithanam

This synthesis of the traditional and the modern holds promise of survival not only for them but for humanity as a whole. The historical experience of the bhil tribals of Alirajpur in Madhya Pradesh and their organised resurgence in recent times may have pointers for the evaluation of a modern theory and practice of ecological ethics.||Rahul

But the quality of decisions rendered will always depend, as well, upon the quality of the decision-makers and on the extent of public awareness and activism. This article discusses the key factors in formulating a regulatory framework for the Indian power sector.||John Byrne,Chandrasekhar Govindarajalu
