The continuity of traditional village leadership is ephemeral. Exposed to the new political, economic and cultural factors, the village polity is experiencing novel strains in response to which it is gradually acquiring a pluralistic character. The leadership of the future would be accountable to its followers and would have to accommodate the interests of different groups 'legitimately' competing with one another for leadership positions.

13/9/1969- ||spacial articles||40737928||Who Chooses Modern Medicine and Why||Medicine is an important field in which displacement of the traditional professional, through elimination or absorption of his knowhow by his modern counterpart, is an essential part of the process of modernisation. It is of considerable interest, therefore, to find out who are the people in a developing society who adopt modern medicine and what their reasons are for doing so. This paper reports some of the results of a preliminary inquiry carried out in Ghaziabad town near Delhi. The usefulness of this exploratory study lies in its having led to the questioning or refutation of certain assumptions regarding the influence of the age, education and upbringing (whether urban or rural) of a person on his acceptance of modern medicine. Even where a significant association was found, its nature turned out to be different from what had been anticipated. [The author acknowledges with thanks the assistance of R C Bhatnagar who administered the interview schedules to the interviewees and P C Verma who carried out the statistical analysis of the data collected. The latter also gave help at all stages of the inquiry. He, P C Joshi and S Navlakha read an earlier draft of this paper and gave valuable suggestions. The responsibility for the paper in its present form is, however, wholly that of the author.]||T N Madan

Similarly, to meet the short-term seasonal variations in demand it may be necessary to maintain what may be called transactional surplus capacity. In this note an attempt has been made to formally demonstrate how the precautionary and transactional surplus capacities may arise. The excess capacity over and above these levels may be called improvident excess capacity, in the sense of not planned to cover the uncertainties and variations considered in this paper.||V Mukerji

The different bases on which managing agents' remuneration was fixed all placed a high premium on maximum output, large scale and immediate profit. As a result, while collieries never languished for want of finance for immediate profit-making, there was little investment in modernisation and rationalisation. This tale of greed and short-sightedness was repeated during the War and immediate post-War years which were a period of high prices and profits for the coal industry.||A B Ghosh

Statistics thus clearly support the theory, which has won instant acceptance, that the Soviet Union has displaced the United States as China's enemy number one. What the statistics do not make clear, however, is who is responsible for this change. More important, this kind of superficial analysis obscures the Chinese leadership's view of the world and of China's place in it as sketched, clearly and with consistency, by Lin Piao in his political report.||G P Deshpande

The present system, however, continues to encourage the States in their fiscal jugglery, and prevents viewing of the problems of federal finance in their totality. A permanent body by itself will not solve all problems, but it will at least help generate in the States a sense of confidence that any "injustice" done to them need not be endured for five long years.||Jayanta Sarkar

The price differentials are estimated at all-India level for different groups of consumer items like cereals and cereal substitutes, other food and non-food, using Laspeyres's, Paasche's and Fisher's formulae. On the whole, the urban price level is found to be 15 per cent above the rural price level; this differential was 11.5 per cent for cereals and cereal substitutes, 14 per cent for other food items, 12.5 per cent for all food items and 26 per cent for the non-food items to the extent included in the construction of the index. The above price indices are utilised for deflating the urban per capita total consumer expenditure to compare the level of per capita household consumption in rural and urban sectors. It is noticed that the urban-rural differential narrows for other food items, all food items and non-food items but widens for cereals and cereal substitutes. [The authors are indebted to Professor Ρ C Mahalanobis who initiated extensive studies on level of living at the Indian Statistical institute based on National Sample Survey material and, in particular drew attention to problems created by inter-temporal and interregional price differentials. They are also thankful to M Mukherjee for initiating this project and to G Kalyanasundaram and A K Halder for the programming and tabulation of data on the IBM 1401 computer.]||G S Chatterjee,N Bhattacharya

The historical narrative bears the unmistakable stamp of a secretarial product with little effort to discover new information, explore new materia! or even to fill conspicuous gaps in available information. Smugness is rampant in the assessment of present conditions and trends. The Commission is often content with expressing the hope that the improvement that has taken place in working conditions can be expected to continue on its own. This smugness is matched by an anxiety to avoid what might amount to a sharp criticism of Government policies and actions. The Commission's half-hearted approach to the crucial issue of the right to strike is seen in the numerous ways in which it seeks to qualify the freedom. This can hardly contribute to the promotion of bipartite relations based on genuine collective bargaining which is the professed aim of the Commission. The Commissions assumption that once a set of acts and omissions is formally listed as unfair labour practices and is made actionable, implementation problems will somehow sort themselves out is obviously untenable. Enforcement problems never admit of simple solutions. The most effective device to secure better enforcement would be to permit greater initiative and freedom of direct action to that party which has a stake in proper enforcement. The discussion about the different variants of the minimum wage confuses rather than enlightens.||Bagaram Tulpule

This is more than a 'modest' impact. The potential of the high-yielding varieties is favourable and the problems are identifiable and correctable. If research is funded at necessary levels, if production inputs are made available in the quantities and at the times and places required, and if price policy continues to provide stable, incentive prices, then expansion of coverage upto the limits of irrigated and rain-assured acreages at a fairly rapid rate appears to be promising. Analysis of rainfall yields further insight into the production record and the role of technology. During the period 1961-62 through 1967-68, the rainfall index "explained" 99 per cent of the variation in yield. The one observation that is significantly different from the trend line is 1967-68 yields.

Yet State Governments have a major responsibility in the field and also incur large expenditures on their own programmes of Scheduled Caste welfare. An attempt is made in this article to assess the efforts of the State Governments in improving the condition of the Scheduled Castes. Two indices are used for this purpose : first, how many Ministers and of what rank are assigned to the task in each State; and, second, what is the expenditure on Scheduled Caste welfare in each State in relation to the Scheduled Caste population of the State.

Consequently, public expenditure on housing construction has matched that on welfare measures and has been very meagre And the emphasis has been on house subsidy rather than on house construction. Also, rigid attachment to standards of housing has meant that little has been done to provide basic amenities to as vast a population as possible in the absence of the 'standard' house which is in any case financially beyond their reach. Such neglect of an important problem of urbanisation can only prejudice prospects for orderly social change.||K C Sivaramakrishnan
1/1/1969- ||industrial gaps||40736846||Utilisation of Heavy Engineering Capacity||This paper discusses the demand prospects for some major items of industrial machinery and the export efforts needed during the Fourth Plan to keep their installed capacity utilised. The initiative and enterprise for maximum use and development of indigenous machinery and equipment can come only from Indian expertise. A major factor that has been holding up the progress of machine-building industries and the export programme is the existence of wide gaps in designing capacity. This aspect has not received much attention in the past and needs to be set right at the earliest. The basic weakness of our export promotion efforts is the high cost structure of metallurgical and engineering industries. In the final analysis these industries cannot build up exports on a system of continuing subsidies. Indian consulting agencies can make a major contribution by getting entrepreneurs and governments interested in Indian equipment. These efforts will not be effective if the Indian consultant is neglected at home, and not provided with opportunities for development and creative engineering.||M N Dastur

The next question, once this issue is settled, is to devise measures which would be administratively feasible, efficient and equitable. The author demonstrates that the tax ratios for non-agricultural and agricultural income are not comparable. If they are made roughly comparable and taxed on a comparable basis, the tax revenue from agriculture would be lower than what it is now! This would suggest that in relation to 'taxable income', farm households are paying a higher proportion of their incomes than their counterparts in the non-farm sector. It may be that land revenue is the most suitable form of land taxation. Pending fresh settlements, land revenue could be made more progressive in its incidence by instituting a graduated scale of surcharge.

8/11/1969- ||special articles||40738091||On Learning to Live with the Second Best||No one in India confidently believes in the likelihood of effective land reforms in any but a few exceptional States. Rather than be paralysed by wistful looking back to the idealism of earlier years , it would be better to seek an alternative solution. This solution lies in promoting the process of collective bargaining in agriculture: of labourers' unions with capitalist employers, of tenant unions with landlords, and of water-users' unions with the owners of expensive tube-wells or others with monopoly access to irrigation water. True, the divisive structure of villages and the absolute level of poverty would, perhaps, justify a degree of pessimism about the prospects of this solution. It might, nevertheless, be possible for legislation at the State level to do something to alter the balance of power in the villages. Action on these lines in pre-War Japan did attain a degree of success. Dispute over this solution would in any event, be more relevant to the realities of the present situation than plans for land reform.||R P Dore
1/7/1969- ||dynamics of social change||40739868||Secularism and Communalism||The evidence of history does not support the view that secularism as embodied in the Indian Constitution is derived from ancient Indian traditions or that there is a pre-existing place for secularism in the Indian system of values. The concept of nationalism had to be improvised in India with the assimilation of certain deities from the Hindu pantheon and the deification of India as the Mother. Such a view of nationalism could hardly be expected to appeal to the Muslim mind. Sanskritisation among the Hindus has had a parallel process among the Muslims: Islamisation. This did not make Pakistan inevitable; it only heightened the emotional appeal of Pakistan. Gandhis political strategy was to make an appeal to each mass group on an issue that was likely to have some emotional appeal for it and at a time which appeared suitable for his purpose. In any event, to carry the political movement to the countryside, Gandhi expressed himself in a Hindu idiom, and his objective appeared twofold: to attain independence and to consolidate Hinduism. The impact of the secular leadership of the Congress, Nehru's charisma notwithstanding, was largely confined to the intellectual level. Nehru's forward-looking programmes to undermine communalism through modernisation was essentially the programme of a small minority. The vast majority of Hindus and even Congressmen had decidedly traditional and therefore communal attitudes and norms. Indian Muslims, perversely left part of another nation by the two-nation theory, have turned worriedly in upon themselves and cling more intensely than ever before to faltering traditions. In seeking to consolidate themselves as a group, however, they are moving in consonance with the general trend of Indian politics. The conflict between secular state and communal society in India can be resolved only through the actual translation of constitutional provisions.||Imtiaz Ahmad

The union of family and business structures imposed double and sometimes conflicting values: as a business concern the goal was to maximise profits but as a family it was to maintain stability. This pattern restricted contact with newer channels of information and technology and emphasised tradition. Business, social and civic life intertwined to amplify the concentration on business and the concern for stability. Guilds served as the focus for these various strands. While guilds were not organised solely along caste lines they were predicated on the existence of business and trade groups which were dominated by specific castes. Guild functions buttressed the stability and conservatism of the bania community. The bania community of Ahmedabad entered the textile industry with marked hesitancy. Outsiders promoted the first mills. The industry could not expand without bania financial support but, once the banias did begin to promote their own mills, growth was rapid. As the city got industrialised, they adapted for the new conditions many of their pre-industrial institutions, notably the family firm and a modified guild system of organisation vis-a-vis merchant and labour guilds.||Howard Spodek
30/8/1969- ||special articles||40737875||The Aeronautics Committee Report A Critique||The Air Force does not know what kind of planes it wants. Even if it does, it does not know why it wants them. When the prime customer of the aircraft industry does not do its homework, what can any committee do except dish out near-platitudes and ask for the setting up of yet another committee to do what the Air Force ought to have done? The management of HAL now provides sinecures for Air Force personnel who, while knowing all about flying aeroplanes, do not have the faintest idea of how to produce them. The only way HAL can operate effectively is for it to be made independent of the Ministry of Defence. Once the Air Force states its requirements and places its orders, it should be allowed only to monitor progress intermittently on a 'milestone' basis and not continuously control the processes of research, development and production. Air Force personnel qua Air Force personnel should not be on HAL's Board. In respect of civil aircraft, the Aeronautics Committee has recommended, very pertinently, that the design and manufacture of a machine for use in agriculture should be a major task for HAL and that "pressing military requirements'" should not be allowed to swamp it. On other civil aircraft, however, the Committee merely says that if HAL and Indian Airlines co-operate there is scope for manufacture of aircraft to replace the F-27 and the HS-748 "in due course". This casualness is most unfortunate since the only way the aircraft industry can be kept alert and productive enough so that its reaction time to meet an emergency is short, is for it to make use of the opportunities offered by the market for civil aircraft within the country and abroad. India has the basic expertise for development of the aircraft industry. What is needed now is a wellfunded national institution outside the Ministry of Defence which will be a marshalling yard. All Research and Development activity in aeronautics and space should be the responsibility of a single independent professional body such as a Space and Aeronautics Research Commission (SPARC). SPARC should replace and take over the functions of the Aeronautics Research Council of the CSIR, the Aeronautics Research and Development Panel of the Ministry of Defence and INCOSPAR of the Atomic Energy Commission.||Venkatasubbiah Siddhartha

Such a rise, it is argued, will not only benefit the economy of USA and strengthen confidence in the Dollar, which should be assisted to remain strong and to continue to play the role of a reserve currency, but will also do good to the world economy at large, and especially the economies of the developing countries. Recent trends towards restrictionism, curtailment of the flow of international capital and diminished aid to the Ißss-developed areas need to be reversed. Enhanced international liquidity, consequent on the revaluation of gold, assisted by the system of Special Drawing Rights, should be of material significance in this respect.

How did they acquire before the end of the 19th century a measure of dominance they did not have earlier? The second half of the last century inaugurated the golden dawn of the new middle class in Madras. The leading non-Brahmin groups süßer ed some handicap or other as the feudalistic order in which they held places crumbled round them while the Brahmins with little stake in that order had a great advantage in their traditional cultivation of formal learning. These short-lived advantages were soon eroded by the widening of franchise and education. Nevertheless, the divisions in non-Brahmin ranks beween high and low, the successful Brahmin-low caste alignment against the high caste non-Brahmin and the broadening of the anti-Brahmin movement into a social reform movement made it comparatively easy for the Brahmins to adjust themselves. Curiously, the Brahmins' own experience of the North has attracted them to the anti-North postures of DMK.||V Subramaniam

The recent withdrawal of the Federal Party from the coalition government has been provoked as much by its inability to get certain measures through which would have assuaged Tamil feelings, as by the pressure of Tamil youth, a new and important element in the electorate, who wish to go it alone. The post-election prospects of the Federal Party depend largely upon the power equation between UNP and SLFP for, it can strike an effective bargain only when the two main parties are precariously balanced||Urmila Phadnis

The author finds that the tax structure has been highly buoyant with respect to increasing national income. It shows that a 1 per cent increase in national income is being accompanied by roughly 1.858 per cent increase in total tax revenue, and 2.014 per cent and 1.530 per cent increase in the tax revenues of the Centre and States, respectively. The explanation for this lies in the additional tax efforts during the Second and Third Plans ana their relatively greater responsiveness to increases in national income. The built-in flexibility of the tax system is also high.

Earlier studies have investigated the determinants of marketable surplus of subsistence crops without taking the distinction between surplus and deficit villages into account. This paper studies the consumption and marketable surplus relations of subsistence crops in a deficit village in Rajasthan. It is found that the marketable surplus in a deficit village depends on output rather than on consumption. Further that, as a corollary to the distinction between surplus and deficit villages, it is necessary to distinguish between an increase in marketable surplus and a decrease in consumption deficit, in order to understand the marketable surplus relations in a region.||P P Sharma

It contends that the roots of this unrest lie in the socialisation process of the Indian child which does not allow for developing, and learning to constructively channel, aggressiveness. Other factors, such as the lack of social mobility within the educational system, the fact that the evaluative process of the educational system runs counter to that of the social system, and that the sizeable body of rural students who for various sociological reasons become alienated from the village and yet suffer frustrations in their search for urban jobs, all contribute to the uneasy atmosphere surrounding student life. Lastly, in this atmosphere, de-individuation which occurs in mass or group activity makes irresponsible action and violence possible though the same students as individuals might never have perpetrated such violence.||P H Reddy

The following appraisal of the operations of the fair price shops and of co-operative societies in the distribution of essential consumer goods, particularly foodgrains, however, makes it clear that it is too early to think of substituting co-operative societies for the fair price shops system. Both the number of fair price shops and the quantity of foodgrains handled by them have tended to fluctuate sharply from year to year, depending mainly on whether conditions of scarcity or relative abundance prevailed. But even in years of acute shortage and large Government issue of foodgrains, the quantities handled by fair price shops have been meagre, resulting in small gross margins which have been inadequate to cover minimum overhead costs. As for co-operative societies, their activities have been dominated by distribution of fair price foodgrains from Government stocks. They have been unable to diversify their operations for want of adequate credit and the right type of personnel. They have also not had the support of higher level marketing cooperatives and have had very weak links with wholesale consumer stores.||V S Patvardhan

However technically perfect a given device may seem to be, there is more to contraception than the discovery of a mechanical tool. Often ineffective contraceptive practice is an indirect result of a pervasive attitude that family planning is an artificial mode of behaviour that somehow interferes with natural processes. More directly, cultural definitions of sexuality and reproduction might be antithetical to ideas favouring the rationalisation of reproduction, resulting in a heightened feeling of artificiality about family planning. Moreover, the particular cultural attitudes towards sex and sexuality will strongly determine the choice of a contraceptive method and the regularity with which it is used. In this study of sex and contraception, based on investigations in a village in Faizabad district of UP, stress has been laid on accommodation of cultural factors at the personal-sexual level.||Ketayun H Gould

Religion-wise, the Muslims who constitute the majority population of the town show a higher rate of mobility over the three generations than the Hindus who are in a minority. The trend of social mobility among Muslims approximates to that of the town community. It is concluded that, if a town community is divided into majority and minority on the basis of religious differentiation, the majority group is likely to monopolise the channels of social mobility.

British rule heightened such regional variations through its differential effects on the coastal 'rimland' and the interior 'heartland' of the country. The following paper distinguishes between State patterns of education by criteria of allocations of resources to education by the States, and enrolment for education in the different States. It then classifies States into heartland and rimland ones and examines the causes and consequences of the differences between them.||Lloyd I Rudolph,Susanne Hoeber Rudolph

Yet research on the topic is often biased by a set of unexamined assumptions. Family structure and its relation to change in India has long been misinterpreted due to several social myths found in India and by biases of Western social thought. The actual family today has been uncritically compared with an idealised past ignoring the biological limits placed on family structure. Evidence is presented here from a survey of 26 villages in rural Mysore to support the argument that the concept of the declining joint family and the related myth that children are not as well behaved today as in the past is not the property of any one caste, family or economic grouping. The general nature of these beliefs, along with Western social theory is seen as the causal agent for an absence of necessary research on social change and the family in India.

The election has also demonstrated that some of the concepts evolved during and just after the 1967 general election are no more valid. Principal among the casualties is the late Lohias idea of anti-Congressism which brought diverse and mutually antagonistic parties into the grand anti-Congress alliances of 1967. Further, the election, while it has confirmed the decline of Congress, has not pointed to the emergence of a national alternative. The likelihood, instead, is that as Congress declines further different States will find their own regional alternatives. The emergence of regional alternatives to Congress will raise special problems of Centre-State relations and a decision on the part of all concerned to move in the direction of depoliticisation of areas of conflict will be necessary for the viability and integrity of the political system.||B L Maheshwari

This was Lenin's supreme gift to world history, summing up some two decades of titanic ideological and organisational activity. It would be of some interest to try and follow the movement of Lenin*s mind at this time, i e, from February to October 1917. Interest would be heightened in India today, the author maintains, not only because of the divisions in the Indian Communist movement but also because the country stands poised on the eve of historic change.||Mohit Sen

To subscribe to the Soviet view of the Ussuri river incident is, therefore, to accept as inevitable super power domination of the world. The most significant aspect of the Sino-Soviet border clash is not who fired the first shot but that it was the Russians who did everything they could to give the maximum publicity to the incident. The escalation of the border skirmishes into a political campaign took place primarily because the Soviet Union wanted it. The Soviet strategy seems to be to portray the Chinese as an intransigent people determined to achieve their irredentist claims. This is, of course, the image of China popularised in South and South-East Asia by the US earlier. Now the Soviet Union has joined hands with the US. What the Ussuri incident has demonstrated is not the complexity of the history of frontiers in North-East Asia, but rather the unvarying pattern of power relations in Asia, The Soviet Union, like the United States, cannot tolerate an Asian power challenging the present world order. If China had been happy to remain a "middle power", the Soviet Union would have very likely spelt Damansky as Chen Pao.||G P Deshpande

Whether it is estimates of literacy, industrial production, foodgrains or income and expenditure, mere multiplication of agencies and procedures does not provide for internal checks.

Hindus alone cannot be called upon not to act as a community vis-s-vis other religious communities for, secularism is a collective responsibility. It is not communal or religious awareness which constitutes a serious threat to national life or unity. The danger lies in the transformation of this awareness into a separatist demand. Ahmad's equation of the processes of Sanskritisation and Islamisation completely ignores the qualitative difference between their objectives and operation. Inequality and discrimination have not been confined to Indian society alone. They were part and parcel of all ancient and mediaeval societies. Glorification of the past is one of the main ingredients of modern nationalism — and this too is not peculiar to India. If Ahmad was really concerned with examining the problem of secularism and communalism in general, why did he not take the trouble of attempting an analysis of the attitudes and behaviour of the minorities as well?||Prabha Dixit

Since 1947, there has been a vigorous Islamic movement among them. The Hindus no longer regard them as kshatriyas and they themselves are becoming 'full' Muslims. Better communications, education and greater mobility have given a sharper edge to the Muslim identity. The democratic political system is, at least initially, hardening the lines which divide religious and ethnic groups. Greater Islamic consciousness among the Meos has enabled them to view themselves as a part of the Muslim community in the larger Indian society.||Partap C Aggarwal

Limitations of data, especially those arising from the allocation of joint expenditures, will have to be overcome before the true figure of Telengana surpluses can be arrived at. The analysis attempted in this paper does, however, suggest that the surpluses could be substantial. Even if a 20 per cent margin of error is applied to the estimate made here, the surpluses would amount ta not less than 64 per cent of the Third Plan outlay for Telengana.||C H Hanumantha Rao

1/7/1969- ||shifting parameters||40739870||Urbanisation, Industrialisation and Planning for Regional Development||Problems of urban development need to be treated as part of regional development plans drawn up within the framework of the national plan. The weakness of the planning procedure adopted in our country stands out sharply in this respect. The Planning Commission decides the targets and the allocation of resources, determining the sectors and the geographical areas for the investment to be undertaken by the central authority. But while the plan sets aside resources for investment by the States in sectors reserved for them, there appears to be no mechanism for matching the State plans with the national plan so that they form an integrated whole. This failure to integrate the plans at the two levels finds reflection in imbalances between the demand for and supply of factors and services, including public utilities and civic amenities. The impact of projects initiated centrally is transmitted directly to the regional economies which have not prepared themselves for this impact. The regions cannot accommodate the pressures on their existing facilities nor can they take advantage of the multiplier effect of these projects. Matters are further complicated when Central agencies like Railways or autonomous bodies like port authorities draw up their plans independently of the State authorities in whose areas the projects are to be located. In the absence of a perspective for the region as a whole, these projects may lead to conflicts between local and regional interests. As an instance may be cited the controversy surrounding the construction of a bridge over Hooghly to connect the twin cities of Calcutta and Howrah.||Deb Kumar Bose

In wheat the action programme for cultivation of the dwarf varieties was built on sound scientific knowledge. Research data on performance of the different varieties and on the changes needed in agronomic practices were gathered well in advance. In rice, by contrast, administrative action preceded development of scientific knowhow. For example, a major reason for the poor performance in Kerala was the wrong choice of the rice variety, namely, Tainan 3, the grains of which become sticky on cooking. The future of the high-yielding varieties programme thus depends on creating the requisite scientific and training bases capable of anticipating and finding prior solutions to the numerous problems which will arise from the spread of the new varieties. Besides the research and extension framework and production and supply of inputs in adequate quantities, what will determine the success of the programme is the attention paid to post-harvest technology , pricing and crop planning. All these factors will decide how remunerative cereal farming will be which, in turn, will influence farmers' selection of crops. We should plan now for a substantial reduction in acreage under crops like jowar and for introducing in the areas so released alternative land-use patterns.||M S Swaminathan

It has, over this period, swung from complete restoration of free trade after the Korean War boom, to virtual abolition of free trade in several parts of India by the mid-sixties. The range of policy measures have often originated in political pressure, popular biases, inadequate knowledge, or simply in developmental zeal. Indeed, more often than not, they were a reaction to a series of unexpected crises than to planned measures that carefully considered the various requirements of a longrange price policy.

Similarly, in view of the scattering of fiscal powers and developmental responsibility among the various layers of government, it is unrealistic to suggest that urban development must increasingly rely on the internal resources of metropolitan areas. Sooner or later urban development would have to be related to a more positive approach to decentralised development. In the absence of a strategy for decentralised development and given widespread distrust of locai government among the upper echelons of Government, the brunt of the responsibility for urban development in practice falls on a variety of special purpose authorities. This kind of ad hocism in formulation of policy and in its implementation is the main cause of the current half-hearted approach, to urban development.||Abhijit Datta

The data presented here give some idea about the dimensions that large-scale farming, mechanisation of agriculture, adoption of improved techniques, etc, have acquired in Punjab. An inquiry designed to yield estimates of dimensions may not be best suited for answering questions about qualitative aspects, for which the approach of type studies is more appropriate. Even so, much qualitative information can be extracted from our data by picking out farmers having certain characteristics and studying the possible explanatory factors going with them. This type of analysis still remains to be completed; the results of our labours in that direction will be presented in a third instalment. [The work was carried out by the author jointly with A Majid and B D Talib on behalf of the Agro-Economic Research Centre, Delhi.

Yet, the effort actually put in is at best meagre. Many of the involved personnel have first of all to be sold on the need, importance and practicability of scientific inventory management. The principal objectives of inventory control are to reduce investment in inventories and simultaneously to minimise idle time by avoiding stock-outs and shortages. This paper deals with the application of two of the more important techniques, A-B-C analysis and EOQ formulae. It shows that even in respect of imported spares, it is possible, with the assignment of certain probability values, to reduce locking up of capital.||A P Saxena

This is so because there is, in fact, a lag between recognition of factors which increase productivity (such as the new agricultural technology) and acceptance of them in practice by farmers. Therefore, though the 'economicness' of size of holding should not be rigidly identified with any particular size of land, there is yet need to have a working definition of economic holding.||D S Mehra

The gloomy facts of Negro life and living are not relieved by some improvement in his economic conditions. Nearly a quarter of urban Negro marriages are dissolved, a quarter of Negro births are illegitimate, and almost a quarter of Negro families are headed by women. His personal inadequacy and continued inability to establish himself in a traditionally male-dominated culture has forced the Negro to "base his self-esteem . . . on a kind of behaviour that tended to support a stereotyped picture . . ." Discrimination against the Negro has been institutionalised through built-in attitudes, inferior education and brutal police hostility. His metamorphosis from Uncle Tomism to aggressive Black Power confrontation has passed through several phases, ending now in the attacks on white property and white police as the twin manifestations of the power system: "Whitey talks about [why] black people should not be armed when this country was born in violence. What he really wants is to be violent himself and insist that black people be submissive but if s not going to happen that way, not any more." The rise of the white backlash in strength is an obvious and significant consequence of the black power confrontation. There seems to be a distinct swing towards racial conservatism — and decadence — among the ranks of white workers and traders. Black militancy on the other hand seems to be moving towards making a community out of the numerous Negroes, active responsible and proud men out of emotional slaves. The programmes of the various black power groups are basically aimed at the economic, political and social resurgence of the Negro, the whys and hows of the future. The Negro's principal ally is the young college kid generation. In a significant way the university is the major action centre for racial desegregation. The most exciting dialogues on race relations are taking place in the university forums.||Nitish R De

The Census authorities had conducted a few village studies in 1961. In future, Censuses might do well to prepare monographs examining the benefits accruing to Scheduled Castes and Tribes from development programmes under the Plans. And as we move towards planning at the district level, comparative studies at the district level too will be useful. It is the argument of this paper that existing data are sufficient to get the work started and that the next Census can be used for purposes that could be spelt out by those who realise where existing data are inadequate.||Brij Raj Chauhan

Pilot schemes with these objectives should be started at a few selected areas and the economic benefits scientifically assessed. Another improvement which should be immediately effected is to associate representatives of the Agricultural Departments of State Governments with the issue of the daily weather bulletins for farmers at all forecasting offices. Close liaison between the meteorologist and the agricultural scientist is necessary if the farmer is to derive full benefit from any weather service specifically designed for him.||R Ananthakrishnan

The preliminary conclusion from the analysis is that in irrigated wheat and sugarcane at higher levels of nitrogen-use, urea yields significantly lower response than other forms of N. It is also found that, in wheat, CAN produced in Punjab gives better yields in UP than in Punjab, while AS produced near UP gives better response in Punjab than in UP. For rice, CAN and ASN yield consistently better results in the States which are near urea producing plants!

Industrial financing has ceased to be a mere loan transaction in which the lender's risk is reckoned in terms of the security provided. Today it is more an investment operation, the risk being evaluated in terms of the profit-earning potential and likely profit rate of the prospective enterprise. All this presumes an evaluative machinery and data systematically presented to demonstrate the viability of projects. In fact, however, neither the banks nor the small industrialists are equipped for such presentation and evaluation. The following article argues that such expert services can be economically organised under the leadership of the Reserve Bank. The new set up could help small industry to formulate and present 'bankable' project reports and banks to get assistance in evaluating the relative merits of projects for taking their financing decisions.||M C Shetty

Besides estimating production, the surveys aim to evaluate market sentiment, which is as important as the production trend. While the investigation part of the survey is conducted on the traditional ' annawarï basis, care is taken to avoid confusion between a ' full rupee crop and last year's crop. Opinions about the crop are taken into account. They are supplemented with a detailed study of rainfall data. The rainfall matrix with the growth cycle of the crop superimposed on it gives fairly useful clues. Hindustan Lever's estimates have been reasonably close to the official estimates even in years of violent fluctuations in output — and they have been available much earlier.||

In the provision of inputs, the Chinese performance has been much better than the Indian. Chinese price policy has also been more favourable towards the agricultural sector. The marketed proportion of Chinese foodgrains production, however, tended in general to decline during the fifties, and the decline seems to have continued in the sixties.||Pranab Bardhan

Yet the Bill has failed to elicit public discussion which is unfortunate because, enacted in its present unsatisfactory form, the legislation may fulfil its negative purposes without achieving the positive purpose of imparting dynamism to industries through fair and healthy competition. The policy envisaged in the Bill is on the British model and has little in common with American antitrust laws. It proposes to strike at the 'abuse' of monopoly power, unlike the more direct American approach which identifies public interest with the maintenance of free and unrestricted competition per se. The definitions and criteria in the Bill for identifying abuse are such as would make the identification and interpretation of the proposed Commission's powers extremely difficult. Also, too little spadework for accumulating information has been done to enable determination of whether, and how, concentration of economic assets is harming or is likely to harm the process of economic growth. This paper makes a detailed examination of the proposed legislation and concludes thai much greater work and careful amendment will have to go into the Bill if it is to fulfil its basic purpose of promoting growth and competition.||A N Oza

26/4/1969- ||special articles||40735628||Roots of Separatism in Assam Hill Districts||Variation in separatist sentiment is examined here with a number of hypotheses about the roots of hills separatism in Assam. The Mizo Hills District is most separatistly inclined. It is followed by the United Khasi-Jaintia Hills, the Garo Hills, and finally the United Mikir and North Cachar Hills. While economic deprivation is a factor in discontent, it cannot claim primacy as an explanation for hills separatism. Christianity and literacy among hill tribesmen are directly related on the basis of district figures. Rankings on both these variables correlate perfectly with district rankings on separatist sentiment. Although changes introduced in the British era are important for understanding tribal separatism, there is no real parallel between contemporary hills-plains political relations and such simple indicators of political integration as annexation dates and formal degree of exclusion by the British. Economic underdevelopment and poor communications are not directly relevant to an understanding of hills separatism, unless coupled with literacy and modern aspirations.||Roderick A Church

The main questions arising out of this debate are: (i) whether or not a village in India has a "sociological reality", (ii) can such a village be satisfactorily comprehended and conceived as a whole in itself, and (iii) can understanding of one such village contribute to understanding of the universe of Indian civilisation? There also arise some related issues (which incidentally have also been discussed in "Closed Systems and Open Minds: The Limits of Naivety in Social Anthropology') primarily methodological in nature. These issues involve questions such as, how much knowledge of the old Sanskritic literature and the traditional Indian civilisation (Dumont and Pocock call it "Indology") is needed by an anthropologist to study an Indian village; can one study a village without any such knowledge, or must he possess all this knowledge to be able to comprehend village society? It is obvious that these latter questions are closely related ßï the former three questions.||Satya Prakash Sharma

29/3/1969- ||review of agriculture, march 1969||40739493||From Protective to Productive Irrigation||Several factors determine the production obtained from a high-yielding variety. In fact, cultivation of these varieties requires an entirely new agronomic technology. The difference between local and high-yielding varieties is not so much in their water requirement as in the technique of water management. The fact is that though in the absence of a balanced use of fertiliser, irrigation does not give very different results as between local and high-yielding varieties, controlled irrigation with balanced fertiliser application gives the full potential of high-yielding varieties, many times higher than that of local varieties. The new concept of irrigation is that irrigation is for the climate and the soil and not for the crop. Much saving of water and many times higher yields can be obtained by controlled and timely irrigations. Water management for the high-yielding varieties has transformed irrigation from being protective to being productive in orientation, and thus, from being extensive to being intensive in character.||J S Kanwar

Experience in advanced countries has shown that some sectors of the economy and certain economic time series move up or down ahead of others. Such leading indicators have to be identified, their approximate leads measured, and arrangements made for continued processing and use of such data. Among the potential leading indicators are construction permits, manufacturers' new orders, connected loads, goods traffic, Government tenders and inventories with manufacturers. The author feels that many standard indicators could be meaningfully identified and used only when the operation of the price mechanism becomes more effective.||Samuel Paul

A strategic defence capability therefore becomes a social overhead for economic growth. We may be faced with a nuclear threat from China and be without help because a direct confrontation among the super powers which have nuclear capability is impossible and has been made remote by mutual agreements among them. Also, it is in the super powers' interest to keep other countries like India from acquiring nuclear defence capability as it would reduce their own manoeuvrability and power. The following article argues that our objective has therefore to be to acquire general strategic capability that can break this emerging distribution of world power designed for the super powers' own convenience, and to neutralise a possible Chinese nuclear threat. The article thus weighs alternatives open to India within this framework of objectives, considers the direct and opportunity costs of the alternatives and the effectiveness of each, and concludes that an optimal nuclear strategy is the only effective answer to India's defence problem.

Traditionally social anthropologists concerned themselves with relatively simple societies and sociologists usually studied complex societies. These differences determinedthe nature of techniques for data collection. But now social anthropology is becoming increasingly concerned with folk and urban societies. With this marked shift, there is no accompanying shift in the techniques employed for data collection. Participant observation is not merely unrewarding in the study of complex societies; it is also partial because it is confined to some segments only, whichhave their own biases. While social anthropology is exploratory, sociology is explanatory. The former describes generally without hypothesis, the latter uses systematic procedures to arrive at generalisations.

The data indicate that secularity explains only cognitive and not behavioural adoption of health practices. It is suggested that there is need for greater utilisation of mass media and extension agents to bring about change in value-orientations of individuals and that greater empirical research, with refined tools of measurement, is needed in the field of values to contribute to theory.||J V R Rao,H S Verma

The by-elections have reflected this improvement. Mobilisation does not operate in a vacuum, however, and needs a developmental and ideological base, especially since the Rajasthan voter has shown increasing signs of politicisation. This the party has tried to project. The party's support of bank nationalisation and its famine relief operations have helped in this. But it will not be an easy win for the Congress. Party unity is not consensual but tactically managed. The opposition parties have not given up hopes of forming a united front. And finally, the feudal forces have not given up their struggle for power, though their hold is on the decline.

18/1/1969- ||special articles||40737260||Stresses in Caste Stratification: A Study of Six Villages in Rajasthan||Significant changes have taken place in the caste structure over the past 30 years. These follow two types of changes that have taken place in the village community — structural change which includes abolition of Zamindari and Jagirdari, introduction of Panchayati Raj, adult franchise, co-operatives, etc, and peripheral changes such as the establishment of modern schools, construction of roads, and migration. Major processes of mobility which have thus resulted within the caste stratification are (i) modernisation and de-sanskritisation, (ii) proletarianisation and bourgeoisiefication and (iii) sanskritisation. While in the past caste rank was coincident with economic and cultural statuses, today economic, political and cultural statuses can be achieved by the efforts of various caste incumbents. This mobility in other respects has accentuated the relaxation of caste rules of commensality and ritual ranking. Yet, few villages wish for the abolition of caste, though they acknowledge the need for adapting the system. For they fear that abolition may lead to total disharmony. [The field work on which this paper is based was conducted for a doctoral dissertation on the Changing Rural Stratification System : A Comparative Study of Six Villages in Rajasthan, India during 1964-65. The six villages were selected from three districts of Rajasthan, namely, Sikar, Jaipur and Bharatpur.These three districts corresponded roughly with three subregions in Rajasthan on the basis of distinctions of soil types, rainfall, crops, economy, dialects, dress and rituals etc. Further, two villages were selected from each subregion, one suburban and the other remote. These villages were Murwara and Bawari from Bharatpur subregion, suburban and remote, respectively. Harmara and Bhutera from Jaipur, and Sabalpura and Roopgarh from Jaipur and Sikar subregions were selected, respectively.

The following article attempts such a study for India, using for raw material four available series of price data. What is revealed is a rising secular trend of price levels during the period, and that, agricultural prices have tended to exert greater pressure on the general price level than non-agricultural prices.||N K Thingalaya

To make the municipalities' finances go farthest in their usefulness, municipal plans will have to be integrated with State and national plans and municipal finances with State and national finance.||P L Bhargava

The attempt to meet all objectives through each of the economic policies has meant the non-existence of a wage policy. The Labour Commission was to evaluate wage policy. But, by failing to make the initial conceptual distinction between particular policy objectives and the constraints on their implementation, and by committing several additional methodological errors of its own, it has merely succeeded in repeating well known conclusions, and these, on dubitable bases.||T S Papola
1/7/1969- ||growth studies||40739873||Growth of Greater Bombay, 1951-1961||Physical space together with the land-use pattern and density acceptable to the community set the ultimate limit to the size of an urban population. In Greater Bombay one finds a high negative correlation between density and intercensal rate of growth of population in the different wards. The less densely populated eastern suburbs have gained population at a faster rate than the western suburbs. And within Bombay island proper, growth has been relatively higher in areas with unbuilt land or with scope for vertical growth of buildings. Population projections for urban agglomerations like Greater Bombay or the Calcutta Metropolitan District should, therefore, take into account not only past trends in the ratio of the population of the area under consideration to the urban population of the State but also the available space for residential construction and the acceptable density of population.||Pravin Visaria

29/3/1969- ||review of agriculture, march 1969||40739501||Problems of Buffer Stocks||Over the 15-year period ending 1964-65, between two successive years foodgrain production deviated from the trend by more than 4 per cent in 9 years, the maximum fluctuation being plus/minus 11.5 per cent. The period between 1964-65 and 1967-68 was marked by abnormally large fluctuations which buffer stocks cannot be expected to even out. Analysis of production and per capita availability of foodgrains between 1949-50 and 1964-65 suggests that a buffer stock of 4.3 million tonnes would have been adequate to equalise supplies in two out of every three years over this period; for equalising supplies in 19 out of every 20 years, a buffer stock of 6 million tonnes would have been required. Considering that fluctuations between 1964-65 and 1967-68 were abnormally large, the objective of a buffer stock policy should be to build up stocks of 7 million tonnes. This was the conclusion reached by a Seminar on "Problems of Buffer Stocks' 9 organised by the Indian Society of Agricultural Economics at Bangalore in November 1968. This article presents a summary of the discussion at the Seminar. The Seminar also discussed buffer stock purchase and sale policies, cost of buffer stock operations and problems of storage and financing. [The papers presented at the Seminar have been collected in a volume which is in press.]||M L Dantwala

In general, prices received by agriculture rose at a faster annual rate than those paid by agriculture, and yet the consequent secular improvement in favour of agriculture in the net barter terms of trade was marginal. The income terms of trade registered a significant rate of increase, thus indicating the improved purchasing power of the agricultural sector for non-agricultural commodities. While the rate of rise in the prices received by agriculture compensated for the rise in the prices that agriculture had to pay for non-agricultural inputs, the cost of agricultural inputs for the non-agricultural sector increased at a faster rate than the prices paid by agriculture for all non-agricultural products. The contribution of agriculture to the growth of the economy during this period was encouraging. On the demand side, the decade 1951-52 to 1960-61 witnessed a rise in total purchases by agriculture from non-agriculture. During this period, more than half of the increase in the use of nan-agricultural inputs in agriculture was due to the larger purchases of fertilisers and introduction of new inputs, such as pesticides, insecticides, diesel oil and electricity. It is noteworthy thai this refers to a period prior to the inception of the new agricultural strategy. However, the insignificant increase in consumption by agriculture of non-food items including education, conveyance, durable and semi-durable goods indicates a certain lack cf momentum in the diversificailoti of consumer demand in this sector. But this phenomenon is modified by the enhanced expenditure on other non-agricultural products. On the supply side, agricultural production, total and marketed, registered a secular growth, slower than the prices received by agriculture but faster than the improvement in the net barter terms of trade. The degree of monetisation in the agricultural sector increased during these 15 years. Abstracting from trends, the elasticity of marketed surplus with respect to agricultural output, though less than unity, was positive and significant. [This paper is partly based on the author's doctoral dissertation "Agriculture-industry Relationship in the Indian Economy, 1948-49 — 1958-59" submitted to the University of Delhi in 1963. The author is grateful to Dharam Narain and C H Hanumantha Rao for their helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper. She is thankful to V Raja Rao for computational assistance.

Three generally backward areas have been identified in the State's Five-Year Plans, namely, the Hill Districts, Eastern UP, and Bundelkhand. Western UP is one of the prosperous agricultural tracts of the country. Since all these regions are predominantly agricultural, whether we consider the share of agriculture in regional income or in the regional working force, economic disparities between the regions may be explained mainly with reference to the disparate levels of agricultural development.||Ajit Kumar Singh

The commonly practised way of predicting it, by historical comparisons with other countries, is full of pitfalls. The other method of predicting it for particular areas, by reference to possible migration, birth and death rates, can be more reliable but often is not, for lack of adequate data and of empirically-based models. What is known, however, is that urbanisation in India grows mainly on account of migration from rural to urban areas in the expectation of higher incomes in the urban centres. In fact, for quite understandable economic reasons, urbanisation does not so much follow industrialisation as industries throng to already urban centres. The nature of urbanisation over the next decade will thus be determined by the overall pattern of economic development in the country — by whether or not there is significant economic development, and by whether this is mainly on the impetus of industrialisation or of agricultural development. In any case, it would seem advisable for Government to concentrate on further development of existing mediumsized towns.||Nirmala Banerjee

These farmers, who constitute only a small proportion of total farmers, are favoured by a number of socioeconomic factors. The majority of farmers look more to such traditional channels of communication as neighbours, relatives and friends. It should be recognised that farmers prefer different sources of information at different stages of the adoption process. Any attempt to completely institutionalise the communication process, as it was assumed in community development and national extension programmes, is likely to be inoperative and unpromising at this stage.||N S Shetty

They maintain a pluralistic or relativistic ethical system : "class for the city and caste for the village". There are three distinct dimensions of the family: the household living under one roof, the kin group which shares joint rights to property and the subjective idealised models of family structure. Each of these dimensions responds differently ßï the impact of industry. The ideal and property dimensions, for instance, are complete reversals of the household dimension, and are hardly affected by the impact of industry. How a family responds to the pressures of industry may depend on which family dimension we examine. The flexibility which the joint family system shows up in Jamshedpur may actually facilitate more than obstruct the adjustment of people to the demands of industrialism by providing for individual mobility as well as familial networks of mutual aid and security.

While this disparityhas been noted and discussed, no action has followed to narrow it with a view to maximising the increase in total agricultural output. This article aims at showing that, while Bihar's rates of growth in agriculture havelagged behind, it is important to give a boost to them through planned investment and programmes. This is because, even as things are, Bihar contributes a significant proportion to the country's agricultural production.||Randhir Sinha,D K Singh

Since such batteries are a small component of consumer expenditure, the demand for them is derived from the demand for two major commodities, torches and transistor radios, to which government and export demand are added. The total requirement of dry cells is expected to rise from 414 million in 1968 to 1150 million at the end of the Fourth Plan. In view of this large market, the projection of market shares recedes into the background. Availability of the product at the right time and at right prices is, however, an important determinant of future demand.||M Mohan

While the caste system prolongs their handicaps, such protective legislation against it as there has been touches only the untouchability aspect — and that not very effectively. In the agricultural sector, where the Scheduled Castes are concentrated, their situation compared with that of non-Scheduled castes is still very inferior as regards titles to land as well as size of holdings. Their depressed position is reflected again in their economic and social mobility. Their rates oj urbanisation and education, compared to those of non-Scheduled castes, are low. And their economic poverty is poignantly underscored in the fact that, as between districts which are at the same level of development, the average per capita income of those with a higher proportion of Scheduled Castes is much lower. That progress has been far slower than was anticipated calls for a revision of the original programme of concessions by the Constitution.

Constitutionally Britain was placed to intervene against racial discrimination when South Rhodesia was a self-governing colony. It was primarily Britain's neglect when laws were passed to perpetually handicap Africans, that led to the consolidation of white power and the eventual declaration of UDÌ in South Rhodesia. Today, the fact that the West and the whites in southern Africa have common economic interests, and that Western Europe and America have vast holdings there, deter effective operation of sanctions against the white regimes. Further, the immense striking power and co-operation among the white minority regimes, and the lack of unity among the 'black' north African states, minimise the chances of any successful rebellion by the Africans in the south. Guerilla warfare has burst out nevertheless, with increasing strength. And the odds now are that there will be a stalemate of war and violence all along the banks of the Zambesi.||Anirudha Gupta

In Asia the imitation of earlier industrialised societies is becoming increasingly thorough and is now incorporated in the high priority sectors of the five-year plans. Yet recent developments are beginning to suggest that Asian countries can find a new and less costly path into an industrialised, urbanised future. Indeed, they must do so in order to evade the consequences of depleted and misused resources. The shift in direction should have remarkable consequences for the design and eventual structure of the great cities.||Richard L Meier

29/3/1969- ||review of agriculture, march 1969||40739494||New Concepts in Irrigation: Necessary Changes for New Strategy||With the introduction of the high-yielding varieties, water management in crop cultivation has assumed a new dimension. It is not merely that timely and adequate supply of water is required, but that a conceptual change has to be accepted regarding the factors determining the water needs of plants. While formerly the "transpiration ratio", related to the leaf area, morphological characters, and the root system of plants was considered crucial, today the "evapo-transpiration' by crop plants is considered in decisions regarding water administration. The new concept encompasses water loss governed primarily by meteorological parameters and is even independent of crop species as long as the vegetation is extensive and in an active growth stage. Evaporimetry, the technique of individually measuring climatological elements governing water loss and water needs, can thus be an aid in regulating water management practices. Water supply has, therefore, to be based on needs indicated by the weather in a particular area. In the light of recent advances, present canal practices appear very unsatisfactory. In many irrigation projects, the amount of water released for a given command area is constant from January to June even though the weather gets far drier and warmer. It has also been found that more frequent irrigations give better results than fewer but more prolonged irrigations. This entails certain changes in canal designs and in the rotation systems.||N G Dastane

How has the reconstituted Commission fared in this task during the last 15 months or so? There has been no significant change in internal organisation and procedures. The proportion of technical and research personnel in total staff has in fact declined. While the Commission is a more disciplined body than before and has been able to sweep away some of the cobwebs in the system of Central assistance to States, it is unable to keep a watch over some of the important developments that might affect the progress of planned development. There is more secrecy and less consultation. In the absence of a quantitative framework, sectoral programmes have no clear and definite place in an overall operational plan. There is also fairly clear evidence that the Planning Commission has been abdicating its role in policy formulation and in the setting of social objectives for the planning process. Even if D R Gadgil and his team keep their promise of formulating some kind of a Fourth Plan, their efforts might produce a mere epilogue of development planning as initiated by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1950.||Boswel

This paper essays an identification of the factors responsible for rural-urban disparities in consumption patterns and in the incidence of indirect taxes. It shows with the help of indifference curve analysis that equalising the tax-income ratio would result in inequitous treatment. One of the ways of raising tax revenues from the rural sector, consistent with equity, is to induce it to part with more of foodgrains in exchange for urban goods of consumption by making them available in rural areas at lower prices. Estimates of potential tax revenue from additional (potential) rural expenditure on urban goods of consumption, under alternative assumptions, range from 7 to 13 per cent of total indirect tax revenues in 1959-60, and from 6 to 12 per cent in 1964-65. The key to the mobilisation of resources from the rural sector suggested by Ms analysis is the availability of urban goods of consumption and modern agricultural inputs in rural areas at lower prices.||C H Hanumantha Rao

Rao's estimates of cross elasticity of demand for foodgrains with respect to changes in the price of non-foodgrains are wrong because of his incorrect application of the Slutsky-Schultz theorem on elasticities, though this error does not affect his estimate of potential surplus of foodgrains. Finally, Rao's policy prescription of restricting the rural consumption of foodgrains by selling urban goods cheaper so that the latter will be dearer in rural areas by the same percentage as foodgrains are in urban areas, ignores the costs involved in following such a policy.||T N Srinivasan,P K Bardhan,C H Hanumantha Rao

The institutional consensus, in turn, was composed of two elements : one that was articulated around the party system and the other around the federal system. The ideological consensus also had two aspects to it, one in respect of domestic policies and the other in respect of foreign policy. In each of these four components the Nehruvian consensus was disturbed after 1962-63 and the issues that have been sharpened now can be traced to this disturbance. The so-called polarisation between rival camps and positions triggered by the Bangalore session of the AlCC is, this article argues, part of a process of reconstructing the lost Nehruvian consensus.||Rajni Kothari

The utmost priority should be attached, therefore, to efforts to establish regional and subregional trade and payments arrangements in a framework which would minimise the discriminating effects of such groupings on non-member developing countries. Such a framework can be provided by a Payments Union in which membership would be open to all developing countries as well as to subregional and regional unions and which would be linked to agreed trade liberalisation and expansion measures by member countries. Clearing arrangements on a multilateral basis for payment transactions subject to exchange control regulations of member countries would reduce the transaction cost of developing countries' trade. Credit facilities under the Payments Union would be automatic and would relate only to incremental trade of member countries. The terms and conditions governing credit would be such as to stimulate intragroup trade without discriminating against member countries' trade with developed countries. To provide for situations where its payments to surplus countries exceed its receipts from deficit countries, the Union would be provided with working funds through each member country depositing 5 per cent of its gross foreign exchange reserves with the Union. The Union s reserves could be further enlarged by the IMF according to it membership status and drawing rights.

The colour of the revolution which I have seen in one area after another of India in the 1960s is steel-grey. I call it an industrial revolution. Hundreds of new industries have sprung up; thousands of plants using advanced technology and covering the entire range of modern industry have been put into operation; and millions of men have gone to work in the new factories and in the auxiliary workshops which have mushroomed near the factory gates and along the highways. The resulting demand for raw materials and foodstuffs sent agricultural prices soaring, particularly in the drought years in the 1960s. I this setting investment in farm production has become unprecedentedly profitable. The lure of great gain from actual farming (rather than from rural rents or usury) is responsible for the rise of a class of enterprising agriculturists. A few pockets of capitalist farmers existed in certain regions of India in the years before 1947. But their emergence as a significant group in every State is one of the facets of the industrial revolution which is today changing the face of India.||Daniel Thorner

This district cannot be relied upon to reflect political attitudes and tendencies influential in the rest of the State. In the by-election of January 1969, Kamaraj relied mainly upon personal contact rather than meetings. Students and volunteers from outside campaigned actively for the rival candidates. The suspicion of Government endemic in Kanyakumari played into the hands of Congress. Kamaraj's victory demonstrated his remarkable appreciation of the distinctive political attitudes of the Kanyakumari people, his uncanny grasp of caste and communal factors — and the effectiveness of the Congress organisation in this district.||Jonathan N Gnanadason

Many landlords have, besides, reduced their erstwhile tenants to the status of farm labourers in order to circumvent certain provisions of the land reform laws. Farm labour households thus fall into three categories : (i) those that possess no land (ii) those that possess a little land providing a small proportion of their income and (iii) those that have been reduced to the status of farm labourers. Acute poverty is common to all these categories, and the farm labourers' physical dispersion and social backwardness prevents them from asserting their claims through organisations of their own. Planned effort to alleviate the labourers' lot has failed because it has consisted of short-term solutions unrelated to the general pace and direction of the economy as a whole. To succeed, farm labour policy has to be an integral part of the overall policy for economic development. The basic solution has to lie in increasing demand for rural labour through intensive agriculture and through larger non-farm employment. This programme for the longer term can then be supported by other short-term programmes aimed at assuring, meanwhile, a more reasonable minimum wage to farmers, food and clothing at more reasonable prices through well-organised marketing societies, and off-season employment opportunities for earning supplementary income.||H B Shivamaggi
1/11/1969- ||special articles||40738067||Measuring Community Influence: A Methodological Note||At a time when policy recommendations are increasingly relying on data generated by social scientists, it is incumbent upon political scientists and sociologists to make explicit the arbitrary element in choice of techniques adopted for analytical purposes. Grave consequences can obviously flow from social science data which conceal cleavages in our society or minimise the gap between those who wield power and those who are without the sociopolitical resources needed to participate effectively in community decision-making. The choice of what appears to be a methodological detail can influence the entire picture which ont presents of community leadership. On the one hand, the leadership can appear remarkably democratic, especially when the distribution of socioeconomìc variables among the leadership is juxtaposed with similar distributions among the national population at large, the State population and the community sample. The distributions, if not normal, appear comparatively similar to those applicable to the larger populations. On the other hand, given a different methodological choice, the same data can yield a radically different picture of community leadership. The wider, more egalitarian dispersion of political resources may be revealed as a misleading fallacy. The leadership emerges as an aristocracy which possesses disproportionate access to key political resources.||Satish K Arora

At the same time, in contrast to this reliance on imported theory, almost all the data presented by Indian sociologists was drawn from Indian experience. Regardless of the presence of several foreign delegates, there was an excessive preoccupation with the uniqueness of the Indian case. There is apparently not sufficient appreciation of the fact that problems of socio-political and economic development may be better understood through a comparative approach. It is sad that regions such as Latin America, Africa and East and West Asia were left out of the proceedings of the seminar — and so complacently. Sociologists, and other social scientists, must now learn to look outward and observe societies remote from our own. This may well turn out to be a precondition to a proper understanding of our own society. If one meaning of being modern is to be mobile, Indian sociologists will need to be mobile physically as well as psychically.||Satish K Arora

The authors analyse the behaviour of the marketed surplus in terms of the relevant price and income variables and compare their estimates with the figure of marketed surplus of cereals implied in the year-end projections of the Fourth Plan. Finally, some alternative calculations and extensions and also some confirmatory checks for the reliability of the estimates are provided. [This paper extends and develops a point very briefly noted in the second author's PhD thesis at Cambridge University. The authors are grateful to Τ Ν Srinivasan for suggesting some improvements. The responsibility for the opinions expressed and errors, if any, are exclusively theirs.]||Kalpana Bardhan,Pranab Kumar Bardhan
8/2/1969- ||special articles||40737316||Inter-Sectoral Balance in Fourth Plan: A Demonstration Exercise||The Approach to the Fourth Plan considers 5 per cent and 10 per cent growth rates for agricultural and industrial sectors, respectively, as feasible, along with price and exchange stability. This paper shows that these growth rates imply that the final demand for agricultural goods should be limited to 69 per cent of the output of the agricultural sector instead of 76 per cent as at present. Since exports are targeted to increase by 7 per cent per year, domestic consumption will have to be curtailed drastically. A 5 per cent rate of growth for agriculture will permit the industrial sector and GNP to grow at 8.8 per cent and 5.6 per cent, respectively. But if agriculture fails to achieve this growth rate and, instead, settles down to the present trend value of 3.5 per cent, then balanced growth will permit industrial sector and GNP to grow at 6.7 per cent and 4.0 per cent, respectively. If 8.8 per cent growth rate for industrial sector is insisted upon them, it will lead to inflation, to check which the rate of direct tax will have to be stepped up to 9.5 per cent of national income from 4 to 5 per cent as at present. In order to step up the tax rate to this extent, the rural sector will have to be taxed more heavily than at present.||B C Mehta

It is generally held that a larger of crime in the cities is against property and in the country against person. This generalisation is an over-simplification of a complex situation, because offences lumped together under these two categories are similar in only one respect but different in many others. The countryside has, for example, higher rates of dacoities than the cities. And in at least one offence against person, namely, kidnapping and abduction, the city rates are considerably higher.||D N Dhanagare

Actually, however, what makes India a helpless spectator of the big powers' manoeuvres in the Indian Ocean is not the principle of freedom of the high seas but our lack of naval strength. The economic underdevelopment and the massive populations of countries of the Indian Ocean region are factors which inevitably make for tension and conflict. So the Indian Ocean will not be kept free of tension merely because we wish it to be so. It is only when we have built up our naval strength sufficiently that we can hope to persuade other maritime countries to subscribe to an agreement for naval disengagement in the Indian Ocean area.||Arvind P Desai

Performance budgeting seeks to avoid thesb handicaps by enabling determination of the specific programme goals, selection of the most desirable programmes, a structure of budget display that serves managerial requirements and an information process designed for each programme that at once facilitates a review of the progress and also builds up a logical relationship between the financial outlays and the actual physical achievement. It thus ensures greater accountability in terms of what is achieved and, in terms of control, indicates the cost of achievement. [The views expressed here are personal.]||A Premchand

1/7/1969- ||planning problems||40739875||Controlling Urban Land Values||Though control on urban land values is a necessary precondition jor planning for urban development, so far the problem has been tackled only half-heartedly, if at all. Except for occasional and sporadic public acquisition of land, no effective measures have been devised for controlling land values in cities. Land use control and zoning regulations, which could to an extent dampen the raise in land values, are almost non-existent in our cities. Nor is the tax system effective either in controlling land values or in preventing speculation. Short of public ownership of land or public acquisition of rights in land development there is no way of controlling land values and preventing speculation. But under existing acquisition laws public acquisition on any significant scale is ruled out by the sheer cost of such an operation. This paper suggests the following alternative ways of tackling the problem: (1) Extension of the Estate Acquisition Act to urban areas with suitable modifications. (2) Use of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, with a stiff tax on capital gains realised on urban land. (3) Wider application of the Ahmedabad version of the Bombay Town Planning Act, 1954.||Jayanta Madhab

This paper examines the causes of the contradiction between the theoretical model and observed data in relation to the cotton textile industry. Though gross productivity in smaller units is higher than in larger units, net productivity is lower because i) the smaller units are mainly spinning mills while larger units are generally composite, ii) spinning mills are more capital intensive than composite mills, and Hi) the ratio of net value added to gross product is lower in spinning mills as compared with composite mills.||Paritosh Banerjee
1/2/1969- ||special articles||40737289||Toward a 'Jati Model' for Indian Politics||The fact that development theories first emerged in the West led to what may be called a structural fallacy: that the details of modernisation as it occurred in the West are the functional requirements of modernisation everywhere. Recent research has begun to expose this fallacy in all important domains of development theory. The broad structural features of the modernising process can be readily accommodated to, and indeed can be viably articulated through, a variety of indigenous, traditional social institutions. Although India has evolved a thoroughly modern system of constitutional government, embodying universal adult franchise, parliamentary bodies, etc, Indian political behaviour is in part understandable only when it is recognised that the participants are Indians with a sociological background that is Indian. It is suggested in this paper that the focal point of social compartmentalisation in India is the socio-religious jati. In many domains of modern sodai life, including politics, where caste in any of its traditional forms is not a legitimised or sanctioned basis for group formation and participation, the informal group structures, which form and become the viable bases for determining power relations and reward distribution, tend to be modelled on principles of solidarity, reciprocity, exclusiveness and ethnicity as represented in the jati.

27/12/1969- ||special articles||40738247||Why Does Organised Industry Assail Futures Market?||Futures markets have recently become targets of attack, being responsible for several maladies of the economy. Futures trading in many commodities has been, as a result, either statutorily prohibited or quietly discontinued for want of official sanct'on. Strange as it may seem, it is from organised private industry that attacks on futures markets have mostly emanated. The latest target has been the jute goods futures market. On closer examination it is not so surprising after all that futures tradmg shou'd become tjie object of attack by private industry. Futures markets, wide open to competitive buying and selling, defy domination by a firm or a group. So a dominant firm seeking to control its buying or selling prices must view a futures market as an obstacle. Large agriculture-based industrial units also have an interest in causing the maximum depression in prices of their agricultural raw materials in the immediate post-harvest months when they do much of their buying. Another reason for their hostility to futures trading is thus the healthy influence of futures markets on seasonal variations in prices of agricultural products. It is not surprising, therefore, that those who pay lip services to the ideal of free competition should cry themselves hoarse against active futures markets. But if Government wishes to curb the restrictive buying and selling policies of organised private industry without resorting to price and distribution controls it must firmly ignore these protests and permit active and broad-based futures markets to function.

In the Mewat village studied by the author, those castes which were previously deprived of economic and political power and which subsequently were in a position to become strong, recognised the opportunity and acted with speed and determination. In order to make this gain secure, they began to emulate the religious behaviour of the higher castes. The Brahmins chose power and sacrificed ritual status. The Meos, in order to salvage what they could, completely abandoned their Hindu rituals and became Islamised. The Chamars and low-caste Sikhs are both in keen search of greater ritual purity consistent with their improved status. The changes in religious behaviour of various castes are commensurate with changes in power. The greater the gain or loss in power of a caste, the more the change in the religious behaviour of its members.||Partap C Aggarwal

Demand for foodgrains at the end of the Plan, the author estimates, will be 126 million tonnes. To meet it, production will have to grow at the rate of 5.8 per cent per annum compound. On the basis of examination of the growth rates achieved under the HYVP so far and assessment of the maximum feasible growth of output in areas not covered by HYVP, the author concludes that there will be a gap of 6 to 7 million tonnes between production and demand at the end of the Plan. Talk of dispensing altogether with food imports is, therefore, clearly premature. More important, the temptation to dismantle the procurement and distribution mechanism built up in the last few years has to be resisted. Given the constraints on the growth of output, rational distribution and buffer stock operations on a sufficiently large scale alone can achieve price stability.||S S Madalgi

Benefits of development have not percolated to this sizeable section of the rural population. Caught as they always are in the clutches of money-tenders, small farmers are prone to lose even what little land they own. While provision of credit and. other facilities may arrest their slipping into the class of landless labourers, it cannot make their holdings economically more viable. Land redistribution in the circumstances, is the best way to rehabilitate small farmers. But even land redistribution will not solve the problems of small farmers. For, small farmers are in need also of resources other than land. Co-operatives have not yet quite encompassed the small farmers. And the crop loan system, linked as it is to productive capacity, is unlikely, after having satisfied the larger and better-off farmers, to reach the small farmers. Small farmers are, therefore, unlikely to get adequate finance unless preferential arrangements are made for them. Co-operatives could be required to give a stipulated percentage of their advances every year to small farmers. And, as suggested by the AII-India Rural Credit Review Committee, Small Farmers' Development Agencies could be specially set up to carry to them the new agricultural strategy.||S S Madalgi

22/2/1969- ||review of management, february 1969||40737345||Computers as Sinews of Management||In India most business computers are being used for routine accounting and very little attention is being paid to operations research for the optimisation of functional structures and simulation of the effects of managerial decisions. The case for computerisation rests on its immense potential for extension of human capabilities, particularly in management, rather than their replacement. The high degree of centralisation and pyramidal structure of authority in India should lend itself easily to computerisation, provided the opposition from managements and the problems of implementation are overcome. The virtual absence of software development in India is to be deplored because the lower wage levels here could permit cheaper writing of programs, at least for special purposes, and it should be possible to export such software to countries where labour costs are higher. Computer manufacture in India is still at the assembling stage. Basic development and manufacture should have a large technological fallout in terms of stimuli to the electro-mechanical, metallurgical and electronics industries.||Mathai Joseph

Its costbenefit for any region has therefore to be carefully considered. The following paper examines some implications of the different degrees of mechanisation in the wheat-growing areas of Punjab. It is based on a study of a 10-acre well-water irrigated farm with a typical cropping pattern and using traditional technology. It is concluded that, while the far higher yields of HYV technology require greater man-days to handle the higher yields, the introduction of pumpsets, tractors, threshers and reapers would reduce the mandays required. Though the change in technology displaces labour, the loss is considerably offset by the additional labour required by the increase in cropping and the change in cropping pattern. Marked changes are likely, nevertheless, in the peak labour demand and in the composition of the labour force engaged in agricultural operations.||Martin H Billings,Arjan Singh

Changes in the weighting diagram between the different series are essentially the result of changes in the structural composition of industrial output. The contribution of improvement in statistical coverage is at best marginal. The chain series presented here depicts a more correct picture of output growth, especially in the First Plan period.||S L Shetty

This article suggests an alternative approach to transfer of revenue resources from the Centre to the States, other than for financing Plan schemes, which takes into account the States' relative economic backwardness, resource deficiency and tax effort.||N J Zaveri

31/5/1969- ||special articles||40739685||Inter-State Differences in Manufacturing and Workers' Earnings||Inter-State differences in average industrial earnings of workers is largely the result of differences in the industrial composition in the States. States with more high wage industries have a higher industrial earnings rate per worker than States with more low paying industries. It may be, however, that States with high average industrial earnings of workers provide very little employment. While decisions regarding industrial location cannot be made solely on the basis of what workers can get out of the industries, in deciding how to disperse and diversify industry as between the States, the two objectives of employment potential and workers' earnings are factors to be borne in mind.

28/6/1969- ||review of agriculture, june 1969||40739793||Farm Size, Productivity and Returns to Scale||It is suggested in this paper that Indian agriculture is characterised by constant returns to scale. With returns to scale constant, the explanation for variations in productivity per acre as farm size changes lies in the level of various inputs associated with farm size. The higher output per acre in smaller farms is really a function of the higher input of labour. The analysis here suggests that the explanation for the behaviour of net revenue observed in the Farm Management Studies lies, not in the valuation of family labour at the ruling wage rate, but perhaps in the productivity of bullock labour and variations in it over different size classes of farms. The discussion about farm size and productivity has so far been based on investigations carried out before the setting in of what has come to be termed the 'green revolution'. It would be interesting to examine this question in the light of the changes currently taking place in the countryside.

Consequently, important factors have been neglected in formulating solutions to problems of slums. A major characteristic of the slums is that they resemble rural centres in an urban milieu. They began as 'entry points' for immigrants to the city, and tended to duplicate the closeness and structuring of social life in the village, even reflecting the earlier occupational background of the dwellers. Despite the insanitary conditions and crowding in these 'bustees', life in them is generally well-organised, relatively free of serious crime, and co-operative. This is partly because of the essentially rural organisation of the bustee's social life, but also because, as the urban problems of scarcity and lack of opportunity and mobility have developed around them, bustee dwellers have been desperate not to lose this last foothold they have left. The general social contempt in which bustees are held by other city dwellers also incites a proud response from the bustee, encouraging its population to be far more careful and organised in its patterns of behaviour. Lastly, it is significant that city laws have not only generally failed to improve life for the bustees but have often made any self-improvement by them legally impossible.||M K A Siddiqui

It is helped by the fact of the clustering of colleges in the urban centres and particularly in the capitals of the States. While this urban concentration of education remains a fact, those who want to deal with student agitation and violence must have adequate knowledge of the urban concentration of higher education, the backgrounds from which students come to universities, their hopes and prospects, and the new complex of beliefs and convictions under which they operate. Unfortunately such data are not easily or officially available. The following article draws some conclusions on the basis of data which the author was able to compile. [The data in Tables 2 to 10 were obtained in the course of an inter-State field study into the social backgrounds, attitudes and values of school and college students, teachers and administrators, and parents of school children. The study was sponsored by the National Council of Educational Research and Training, New Delhi. The field work was carried out between August 1965 and January 1966 in Andhra, West Bengal, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Mysore, Punjab, Orissa and Rajasthan. Respondents were chosen on the basis of a stratified random sample of the colleges in each State. A set of reports on this study, consisting of eight State reports and one All-India report, are under print and will be published by the National Council of Educational Research and Training.]||Suma Chitnis

1/1/1969- ||the outcasts||40736850||Untouchability and the Law||This paper is concerned with the relationship between the law and the practices which came to be known as "untouchability". Part I depicts the way in which the legal system of British India supported certain aspects of the caste order. Part II traces the piecemeal withdrawal of this support in the years preceding Independence, and the undertaking by Independent India to eradicate old patterns of caste relations. Part III describes the constitutional setting of these efforts to abolish disabilities. Part IV reviews the reception of anti-disabilities measures by the higher courts. Part V attempts to assess their effectiveness in operation. Part VI explores the prospects for making the law more effective in abolishing disabilities. For the most part this paper is concerned with the "lawyer's law" — the official and authoritative legal rules found in statutes and in the judgments of the higher courts. There is, of course, no exact correspondence between this higher law and the behaviour that it purports to regulate, nor even with the day-to-day operations of the magistrates, officials, lawyers and police who staff the lower levels of the legal system. Some gap or discrepancy between the most authoritative legal pronouncements and patterns of local practice, both lay and professional, is a typical, perhaps universal, feature of any complex multilayered legal system. We shall view the "lawyer's law" as a set of rules for Governmental intervention in caste behaviour, in order to settle disputes, to maintain patterns or establish new ones. After determining the changing scope and nature of this intervention from the point of view of the lawyer's law, we shall then attempt to ascertain its extent and quality. [This paper is part of a larger study of the relation between law, caste and religion in modern India. It was originally prepared for a conference on "The Untouchable in Contemporary India" at the University of Arizona in November 1967 and will appear in the forthcoming proceedings of that conference edited by Michael Mahar.]||Marc Galanter

Before the Cultural Revolution it was estimated that the doubling period for Chinese scientists was less than 4 years as compared with 15 years in Western advanced countries and 7 years in USSR. Mass education at different levels is achieved by making it a duty for every skilled worker, research scientist and production engineer to train the cadres in the respective professions. There is more emphasis on adaptation and application than on original research. It is imperative for Government and public institutions in India to study the events in China. Not a single systematic objective and analytical study of modern China has been published in this country during this decade. Can we afford this negligence?||B V Rangarao

Since the system of import controls has the objective of regulating the end-use structure of available foreign exchange, the latter type of analysis is more pertinent as it provides an appraisal of importlicensing procedures adopted in the past and oßers some guidelines for future policy-making. The following article considers the end-use structure of the imports between 1957-58 and 1962-63 in three import-using sectors, namely the paper and paper products sector, the non-ferrous metals and alloys sector, and the machinery manufacturing sector. It also considers the pattern of changes in the import dependence of these sectors, and examines the relationship between import dependence and production efficiency index on the basis of cross-section data for each sector's firms.||V R Panchamukhi

1/1/1969- ||citizen and deputy||40736852||The Party Representative in Fourth Lok Sabha||The ideology and social base of a long-established, well-organised party are continuously diluted by the need to coalesce many different and conflicting interest groups within itself. Thus Congress fuses within itself a far more complex structure of interest . groups and ideological viewpoints than the new opposition parties which are relatively simple interest aggregating organisations. This paper analyses the professional and educational status, organisational connections and social and political background of members of the Fourth Lok Sabha with a view to indicating the extent to which MPs reflect the social base and cultural demands of their parties. In two-party systems, the parties vie with each other to woo different interest groups. As a result, in spite of socio-political diversity, political energy from diverse sources is harnessed and channelled broadly into the two political parties. In India, however, diversity finds direct expression through a large number of small political parties, and political energy which is not pre-empted by Congress remains impotent. Futile walk-outs and use of disruptive tactics in legislatures, satyagraha, fasts unto death, etc, reflect such waste of political energy.

14/6/1969- ||special articles||40739735||Central Assistance for State Plans How Equitable Is It?||While the backwardness of a State is a consideration for determining Central assistance for the State's Plan, no trend is visible yet towards reductions in inter-State disparities. In fact there is a tendency currently to justify the status quo by tracing the lower Plan outlays of the backward States to the States' unwillingness to raise their own resources. There is confusion here between a State's willingness to raise additional resources and its ability to do so. It is argued in this article that additional resources mobilised may be taken as an index of the willingness to raise resources, but that the composition of the total resources which a State can raise for its Plan is such as to be biased in favour of the already more prosperous States. There is a way open to the Centre for correcting the criteria for allocating its own assistance and for narrowing the hiatus between the richer and the poorer States.||B P R Vithal

From the general class of consumption goods, those have been singled out the growth of consumption of which may be deemed to be less essential beyond a certain point. An attempt has been made to obtain a norm for the consumption of these commodities consistent with past trends in their consumption and general conditions prevailing in the economy, in particular per capita income growth and gains in general consumption levels. The excess of actual consumer expenditure over the levels indicated by this norm is treated as "excessive consumption" indicative of sub-optimal use of resources. Such "excessive consumption** reduces potential saving, diverts investible resources to non-priority lines, puts pressure on balance of payments through sizeable maintenance imports, creates islands of inefficiency in the production structure and, in general, dampens the rate of development.

The new technology, the author concludes, is not likely to significantly increase the current disparities in the distribution of agricultural income among the States, although it may alter the ranks of leading and lagging States and set off a different pattern of regional growth of agricultural output and income. In the likely emergent pattern some of the currently lagging States are likely to improve their relative positions.

1/7/1969- ||planning problems||40739876||Transport Planning for Indian Cities||For efficient planning of goods transport in an urban area location of activities involving movement of goods needs to be carefully controlled. At present, however, industrial locations are specified or permitted in and around our cities and towns with almost every other consideration in mind except the volume and direction of the goods traffic that is likely to be generated as a result. What applies to goods traffic applies as well to location of concentrations of office employment. In our urban areas office employment is growing faster than any other category of employment and concentration of office employment can create severe transport problems — as it has in Bombay where offices are heavily concentrated at one tip of the island. Office functions do not all require to be concentrated in the same area. Government activities and trading activities in particular can nearly always be separated without impairing efficiency; there may in fact be some advantage in such a separation. Educational activities equally can be separately located. As technology brings innovations and the economy progresses, we must expect a shift in the modes of urban passenger transport. The objective should be to encourage those modes which bring the greatest degree of travel comfort to the public for a given investment of resources and which will remain useful far into the future. In effect, this means discouraging use of motor cars in cities and investment in public transport which will not only yield a greater capability in terms of person-trips per rupee invested but also provide more permanent solutions for future transport problems. The simplest way to limit the use of motor cars is to restrict their production. This is what has saved Moscow from the acute traffic problems that other large cities face.||Shirish B Patel

29/3/1969- ||review of agriculture, march 1969||40739492||From Unsteady Infancy to Vigorous Adolescence Rice Development||A review of the experience with the HYVP thrust for greater rice production strongly suggests that in spite of some drawbacks, farmers have responded well to the production opportunities opened up by the new dwarf plant types. The two varieties on which the HYVP was built initially do have characteristics which slowed their diffusion, but the rapid spread of TN-I and IR 8 in just two seasons indicates clearly that the rice farmer is willing and anxious to innovate — all he needs is an assured supply of inputs capable of underpinning a profitable transformation of his agriculture. The disadvantages inherent in TN-1 and IR 8 have been already largely overcome by research. The demand from cultivators now is for new varieties of high yield potential without the defects of the earlier dwarfs; it is not for old varieties with an improved yield capability tacked on. Scientists will be turning their attention shortly to the needs of upland rice farmers, to developing photo period sensitive varieties for areas where drainage and water control are restricted, to work on deepwater rice varieties, etc.||W David Hopper,Wayne H Freeman
31/5/1969- ||review of management, may 1969||40739679||Environmental Forecasting and Corporate Planning||This paper deals with the application of management science techniques to corporate planning problems. It is based upon forecasting and planning activities in Esso Petroleum Company of UK. Each year Esso looks down the road ahead in detail for two years and on a broader basis for upto ten years ahead. Only one horizon year is explicitly represented in the model but the value of operations after the horizon year is taken into account by the use of discounting concepts. The model represents mathematically the range and type of choice available for the long term. Subject to any specified requirements, the model chooses which of the available crudes to buy, by what size ships this crude should be transported, the pattern of refining, the volume of each product which should be sold, the mode of product transportation and, finally, the marketing equipment to be owned or leased. The main value of this work lies in provision of a quantitative understanding of the economic environment, provision for a framework for testing alternative government policy decisions, consistent and co-ordinated analysis of all aspects of the company, highlighting of assumptions and the connection between assumptions and their implications, quantitative evaluation of pursuing alternative strategies, analysis of risk, and contribution to improved business planning. There is no reason why similar models could not be developed and effectively used by Indian organisations.||B Wagle

27/9/1969- ||special articles||40736128||India's Sacred Cattle and Cultural Ecology||An important contribution to the debate on India's sacred cattle is Marvin Harris's article "The Cultural Ecology of India's Sacred Cattle" (Current Anthropology, Vol VII, No a, 1966). Harris contends that "the irrational, non-economic and exotic aspects of the Indian cattle complex are greatly overemphasised at the expense of rationed economic and mundane interpretations" and urges that "explanation of taboos, customs and rituals associated with the management of Indian cattle be sought in the 'positive-functioned' and 'adaptive' processes of the ecological system of which they are a part rather than in the influence of Hindu theology". This article, however, argues that in Marvin Harris's thesis is summarised the entire defence of Hindu cow-worship garbed in pseudo-science. It is suggested here that a cattle population smaller in number but better fed than at present will make a better contribution in milk, traction and dung to human survival and well-being in India. Even if, because of prevailing technology and institutional arrangements in agriculture, it is not possible to reduce the number of draught animals, the large number of cows is wholly unjustified. A smaller number of better-fed cows will contribute more milk and dung and will give enough calves to replace the needed stock of drought animals.||V M Dandekar
28/6/1969- ||review of agriculture, june 1969||40739789||Intensive Agricultural District Programme: Analysis of Results||The results of the Intensive Agricultural District Programme indicate that the strategy of intensification of effort on an area basis has not achieved the objective of rapid increase in agricultural production. The whole strategy of the IADP is supply-based and does not take into consideration the demand aspect of inputs. It is the demand for inputs which will determine their efficient allocation. Unless a strategy is evolved to combine scarce technical, financial and administrative inputs with the managerial inputs of the efficient farmers, rapid growth in agricultural production is unlikely to be achieved. This lesson of the IADP should not be lost and the same mistake should not be repeated in the High-Yielding Varieties Programme. Let the most efficient farmers adopt the HYVP wherever they are.||D K Desai

Nearly all the major cities have anywhere from 25 to 50 per cent of their population made up of individuals whose mother-tongue is other than the regional language. In many of the major cities, the local language is not the exclusive language of the market place and the workplace. The clash of local and national. aspirations leads to tensions between diffefentnainguißtic groups, especially where the local community is economically subservient. In a study of three groups of immigrants, Marathi, Hindi and Tamil, in Bombay, the author found that, contrary to what one might expect, the Marathi group was the least 'adjusted' while the Tamil group was the most 'adjusted'. Can this difference be due to differences in the viable alternatives that these groups may have to life in the city? Or, is it possible that the local language group is not fully reconciled to the multilingual life of metropolitan cities, that they expect a great deal for themselves from what is after all the capital of 'their' State, and that, to the extent that these expectations are not fulfilled, they become alienated from the city? If the latter reasoning is appropriate, then, language serves not only as a means of communication but also as a tag for group identity and a focus for crystallisation of attitudes. Consequently, there is need for clearer thinking on what may be regarded as the limits of regional and national claims on metropolitan cities. These findings are based on a survey of immigrants into the city of Bombay and of multilingual neighbourhoods. The survey was sponsored by the Research Programmes Committee of the Planning Commission.||M S Gore

16/8/1969- ||special articles||40739927||Indian Village as a Unit of Study—I||Recent debate between Louis Dumont and David Pocock (the editors of Contributions to Indian Sociology) on the one hand, and F G Bailey, on the other, which appeared in Nos I, III, and IV of Contributions to Indian Sociology, has brought forth some interesting theoretical and methodological questions dealing with the study of Indian society. The main questions arising out of this debate are: (i) whether or not a village in India has a "sociological reality", (ii) can such a village be satisfactorily comprehended and conceived as a whole in itself, and (iii) can understanding of one such village contribute to understanding of the universe of Indian civilisation? There also arise some related issues (which incidentally have also been discussed in "Closed Systems and Open Minds: The Limits of Naivety in Social Anthropology") primarily methodological in nature. These issues involve questions such as, how much knowledge of the old Sanskritic literature and the traditional Indian civilisation (Dumont and Pocock call it "Indology") is needed by an anthropologist to study an Indian village; can one study a village without any such knowledge, or must he possess all this knowledge to be able to comprehend village society? It is obvious that these latter questions are closely related to the former three questions, and they will be dealt with specifically in the later part of this paper. [The original version of this paper was first presented in Professor Victor W Turner's seminar on "Current British and French Anthropology" at Cornell University in the spring of 1966. The author wishes to thank Professors Turner, Morris E Opler, Marc J Swartz, Berndt Lambert, and Gottfried C Lang, and R D Sanwal who were kind enough to read the paper and offer comments.]||Satya Prakash Sharma

4/10/1969- ||special articles||40737978||Town Planning in Delhi: A Critique||When one speaks of limiting the size of the large cities, two important qualifications have to be borne in mind. First, such an attempt could have the effect of depressing the rate of economic growth since the cities represent important growth centres. Second, the only certain way of discouraging rural-urban migration is through drastic authoritarian measures which are unlikely to be politically acceptable. Following from his critical examination of the Delhi Master Plan, the author recommends a two-tier urban policy. At the national level, urban policy must assess not only the costs but also the benefits of urbanisation. Urban development policy tools need to be evaluated in terms of their effectiveness in optimising the relationship between costs and benefits. At the metropolitan level, emphasis should shift from discouraging growth to devising policies for accommodating and fully exploiting the certain growth that is taking place. The Master Plan for Delhi has detailed figures on the cost of development of the scheme selected, but one looks in vain for comparable figures on the benefits of development. An urban development plan should be more than just a physical development plan. The heavy British bias of Indian town planning has largely ignored social and fiscal policies as planning tools. American planners have only recently, in the wake of urban disruption in the US, begun to use these policies.||Jeffrey R Ewing

The marginal rate of saving of the household sector in the Third Plan was around 12 per cent and of the economy as a whole about 20 per cent. Given the target of 5 to 6 per cent growth of real national income, raising the rate of saving from 8 per cent to 10 per cent of national income in the Fourth Plan will call for a marginal saving rate of 21 per cent, or slightly higher than that achieved in the Third Plan. Further, net external assistance, amounting to about 3 per cent of national income, has been an important source of financing investment in the past. Unless, therefore, net external assistance is of the same order in the Fourth Plan, even a saving rate of 10 per cent would not make it possible to recapture the investment rate of 13 to 14 per cent achieved in the Third Plan.||P D Ojha

Anthropologists and policy-makers have to realise their subjective bias as members or aspirant members of the "core" when they are studying the tribals or actually taking decisions about the tribals. This is a difficult task because we have become used to rationalising our motives and in this we also get the support of the tribal leaders because they will lose their leadership in a new situation. An appraisal of the roles of anthropologists and policy-makers at the Centre is immediately needed, along with surveys to find out what the tribals themselves want — to be integrated or to be detribalised citizens of the Republic of India. Research is needed to test the tentative hypothesis suggested in this paper that the values and behavioural norms of the tribals are more in conformity with the values and norms of industrial organisation than those of non-tribal Indians. [This is a revised version of a paper presented by the first author at the Seminar on the Tribal Situation in India organised by the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Simla. This article is, however, substantially different in its emphasis from the paper which will be published in the Seminar Proceedings Volume.

If the proportion had risen to 76 per cent by 1965-66, which was the Third Plan target, then the shortfall compared to the stipulation contained in the Constitution could be put at about 14 per cent. On the assumption of constant teacher-pupil ratio, salary per teacher, salary-non salary expenditure ratio and prices, expenditure on education was required to go up by 61 per cent between 1960-61 and 1965-66. In 1960-61 prices this meant an increase from Rs 1,164 million in 1960-61 to Rs 1,874 million in 1965-66. The actual increase in outlay on education in ine Third Plan was quite close to this estimate of required increase. The snag, however, lies in the assumption about constancy of crucial ratios and prices. To the extent that these ratios and prices were not constant, the actual outlay fell short of requirements. In future, therefore, resources need to be reallocated in favour of elementary education in any plan for expansion of education.||K R Shah

There has been an increase in per capita industrial power consumption in all States during the decade 1951-61. The most impressive rates of increase are observed in Orissa, Punjab, Andhra and Madhya Pradesh, but all these States had slender bases to begin with. Relative dispersion between the States in power consumption has narrowed down over this decade. The area which seems to have lagged behind is the contiguous tract of Rajasthan, UP and Bihar.

5/7/1969- ||special articles||40740078||Land-holdings Surveys and Crop Estimation: A Proposal for Integration||India is to participate in the programme of World Agricultural Census 1970, sponsored by the Food and Agricultural Organisation. By and large, the data thrown up by the two earlier large-scale sample surveys on land-holdings are insufficient for a critical examination of the existing tenurial structure, mainly because of the lack of production and input data. The real problem is much more than the assessing of how many households own or operate how much of the land. A scheme of integrating the present crop estimation surveys with the land-holdings inquiries is suggested in the following article. The merit of such a scheme would be that production estimates of principal crops can be linked with characteristics of the land-holdings. This would provide valuable material for the planners and research workers, helping them to understand the role of the tenurial systems and other socio-economic variables in the dynamics of agricultural production. Such a scheme would also provide a suitable and meaningful reference period for collecting the landholdings data. Such a period would also make the collection of information on employment in agriculture easier. Besides relating productivity to size of holding, the opportunity to participate in the next census should be utilised to make a beginning in updating the existing frames for sampling in agriculture and in collecting material for tenurial research.||S K Sanyal,V R Sarma

27/12/1969- ||review of agriculture: december 1969||40838792||Profitability of High-Yielding Wheat and Rice||The slower acceptance of HVY rice compared to HYV wheat may be because of (i) differences in the responsiveness of HYV rice and wheat to fertiliser or (ii) higher quality-based price discounts for HYV rice than for HYV wheat. The evidence examined in this paper does not support the hypothesis that the high-yielding wheat varieties have been adopted more rapidly than the high-yielding rice varieties because of their superior response to fertiliser. The contrast between the HYV and local varieties in regard to response to fertiliser is similar for both rice and wheat. In the first year or two after introduction of 'Mexican' wheat, all HYV wheat were red and, therefore, suffered a price discount. With the rapid development of amber high-yielding wheat this has changed and most cultivators are now growing amber high-yielding wheat which is not discounted. The situation is not quite as bright in rice since scientists seem to be somewhat farther away from developing a high quality high-yielding variety of rice.||Robert W Herdt

The land requirement for a viable farm is far less once the new technology, in this case hybrid bajra, is adopted. The paper also estimates the size of the farm that would be economically viable at different extents of adoption and different levels of efficiency when non-adopters go in for the new technology. The level of efficiency at which the technology is adopted is more important than the extent of area brought under it. The new technology will not make all the smalt farms viable. Some other rehabilitation measures will have to be taken for farms below certain limits.

The "Green Revolution" is very much in evidence in Punjab — and so are its consequences. Owner-farmers with irrigated land are making money hand over fist, and the bigger the farm the more they make. Of the burden of taxation there is none to speak of; land values are spiralling; rents are going up and the condition of tenants is not better, if it is not worse. The demand for casual labour has increased and so have wages ; yet there appears to be no shortage of labour. In fact, with the further sophistication of mechanisation, Punjab will be confronted with an ever rising number of underemployed. Most important, meaningful though agricultural progress in Punjab has been, the real sharing in it is restricted to relatively few — perhaps only 10 and surely not more than 20 per cent of the farm households. The new agricultural policy which has generated growth and prosperity is also the indirect cause of the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor. Precisely because the new strategy has found its widest application in Punjab, tlie probability is that, relatively speaking, the gap is greater there than in any other part of rural India. However, these consequences can be dealt with, although not in terms of fumi solutions. The scope of the new technology can be widened, especially if the bias against institutional cliange gives way to recognition of the interdependence between technology and socio-economic reform.||Wolf Ladejinsky

27/12/1969- ||review of agriculture: december 1969||40838799||Agricultural Development in Maharashtra: Some Aspects||There is a marked relationship between agricultural incomes and availability of water in the Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra. Ahmednagar being a dry area, the farmer has to depend on irrigation for assured water supply on which his ability to take to improved technology depends. In securing such regular water supply, the larger and richer farmers are better placed for two reasons. First, they have greater influence on the loan-giving agencies who in turn deem larger farmers more creditworthy. Secondly, they are financially better placed to take the risk of digging a well without certain knowledge as to the availability or depth of the water table. The net result is that, especially with the influx of the new HYV technology, the hiatus between the rich and the poor farmers has widened. There are two ways out of this. One is for the official loan-giving agencies to consciously encourage small farmers to get and use loans for investment in irrigation, and the other is to remove the uncertainties that follow from geo-physical ignorance of the area, its water resources and its crop potential.

1/7/1969- ||dynamics of social change||40739866||The Asian Drama: An Indian View||The subtitle, 'An Inquiry into the Poverty of Nations', to Myrdal's book, "The Asian Drama", draws deliberate attention to the sharp contrast between the new era in Europe which confronted Adam Smith when in 1776 he wrote "An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations", and the dark future in South Asia today. Myrdal in fact had a dual motivation in writing this book : first, an involvement in human problems, and secondly, a scientific interest in the reasons for the lack of development in South Asia. While Myrdal's original interest seems to have been to compile factual information and focus on conditions in this part of the world, he was gradually obliged, through his attempt to identify the causes of stagnation, to construct a theory of development. Hence his 'institutional' theory of development. Myrdal believes that, unless the whole of society and its institutions, in the countries of this region, receive a significant 'push', development may be difficult to attain. Here Myrdal finds himself in deep waters for, despite his attempt to suggest remedial measures to remove the obstacles to development, he feels too uncertain either to predict the course of events in the future for this region or to foresee definite economic progress in it. Also, while he pins his hopes on "the big push" he fails to convincingly portray what the content of that big push could be. Steeped as he is in the concepts of the West, Myrdal cannot help evaluating the history and events of South Asia within the framework of those concepts. He thus fails to see certain critical relationships. While he touches on the role of science and technology in economic development, he fails to follow through its particular flavour and many ramifications for the underdeveloped countries. For instance, the particular weakness of statistical data collected in India could be surmounted by the survey method as developed and used in India. Yet this practice is not thoroughly followed precisely because the tradition of science is weak in Indian society's hierarchical complex. [The author of this article claims to give an intensely personal view of the "The Asian Drama", that the choice of topics is highly selective and subjective and made almost at random because there is so much to choose from. The views expressed here are not those of any of the organisations with which the author was or is still associated.]||P C Mahalanobis

The long gap between the creation and utilisation of irrigation facilities depresses returns on investment in these projects and prevents full exploitation of the additional agricultural production potential. Not only that, the reservoirs get silted as a result of non-utilisation of their waters and their life is permanently reduced. Considering that our resources of water for irrigation are limited, we have to plan for the optimum use of available water by getting the maximum yield per acre in the shortest span of time. Fortunately, modern developments in agricultural technology make this desirable goal a practical one. The advent of the new high-yielding varieties has reduced the requirement of water per crop, primarily because of the shorter duration of these varieties. Combined with the technique of relay-cropping, it is now possible to raise two irrigated crops if there is supply of water to the ayacut for a period of six to seven months. Double-cropping in the past required a continuous flow of water for anything from eight to eleven months. As a result, through suitable choice of crops, it is possible to reconcile to a great extent the objective of protective irrigation — providing insurance against drought and total crop failure to the largest possible area — and that of productive irrigation — maximising agricultural production. This, however, presupposes sound ayacut development under the major irrigation projects covering not merely the agricultural aspects such as soils, crops and water management, but also the broader economic and social aspects which impinge on speedy and full use of the irrigation potential. This article discusses a comprehensive strategy for ayacut development. The application of the strategy is illustrated with reference to the Tungabhadra project and, more briefly, the Upper Krishna project.||Jayakumar Anagol

The size of farm was larger among the adopters, most of whom had pumping sets for irrigation. A larger proportion of adopters were educated and had attended training camps. The high-yielding variety gave almost 75 per cent as much grain more as the local variety. The difference in yield levels of local wheat on adopter and non-adopter farms was not, however, significant. The levels of practically all inputs were much higher for the high-yielding variety which was economically superior in every respect except that of return on capital. When viewed in combination with all inputs increasing returns to scale were apparent for the high-yielding variety whereas the local variety revealed returns to scale.

He suggests that a firm answer to this question cannot be offered without much deeper investigation into the relative production functions. There is hardly any empirical evidence bearing on this problem. At the same time, there is no doubt that this question can be settled only by investigating the nature of the production functions underlying the Indian cattle economy. This note is an attempt in that direction.||C H Hanumantha Rao

1/3/1969- ||special articles||40737368||Investment Pattern for Fourth Plan||The purpose for which the major shift in investment pattern in favour of steel and heavy industry was brought about in the Second Plan has now been largely achieved. In the Fourth Plan investment in heavy industry has, therefore, to be limited strictly to what is necessary for effective utilisation of capacity already built up. The accent has now to move to timely completion of irrigation projects in progress, to efficient agricultural exploitation and to agro-industrial development forging the backward and forward linkages. The most important exercise at the present moment, it follows, is stringent application of the priority test to each component of the investment proposed in organised industry and mining in the public and private sectors. This shift in emphasis has important implications for the problem of financing the Fourth Plan. Going slow on Bokaro, for instance, alone implies a saving of the order of Rs 500 crores. Assured supply of investment finance of this order, together with adequate organisational measures, may be amply sufficient to bring in another 12 million acres of land under irrigation in two years from now through timely completion of major and medium irrigation projects in progress. The broad investment pattern for the Fourth Pian spelt out in this paper throws into relief the substantial shift in the responsibility for implementation, away from Central Government and organised big business, towards State Governments and regional medium-and small-sized enterprises. The bulk of the financial resources of the nation has, therefore, to be directed towards State Governments and regional medium-and small-scale industries, along with the necessary strengthening of State administrations and regional entre preneurship.||B V Krishna Murti

Among agriculturists, the out-mobility of sons of agricultural labourers is relatively higher than that of the sons of owner or tenant cultivators. The extent of in-mobility into business and owner cultivation is the least. Irrespective of social origins, sons find it relatively easier to move into non-agricultural occupations than into agricultural occupations. The system does not offer equal occupational opportunities to sons of all origins.

Though they are still not eligible, without acknowledging their caste, to benefit from the reservations of quotas for scheduled castes in Government services and from the reservations of constituencies, unlike the scheduled castes they have not fared badly in open competition for Government jobs or in elections from general constituencies. Rapid politlcalisaiion of the group, its relatively high literacy rate as well as its numerical strength in the one State where most of them live, Maharashtra, are among the factors which have made this possible. Neo-Buddhists in Ceylon, though fewer in number than their counterparts across the Straits, have gradually assumed importance because of the political implications of their acceptance of a faith which is the religion of the majority community in the country. The Sinhalese-Tamil political interaction has heightened the interest of the major Sinhalese parties in the problems of neo-Buddhists.||Urmila Phadnis

Where Mill, Τ Η Huxley and Herbert Spencer were the dominant western influences on liberal educated Indians, Ruskin, Tolstoy and Thoreau made a deep impression on Gandhi. While the former group was scientific in outlook and believed in social reconstruction through organisation and material betterment, the group that influenced Gandhi was intensely individualistic in its social philosophy and had a negative evaluation of the industrial process. To understand Gandhi's marked preference for this set of ideas, one may find it useful to remember that he was primarily Jain in his convictions and that, when in the west, he had felt emotionally alienated from the west's industrial society.||R Srinivasan

This is because Government is sensitive about pushing its own programme where elected leaders, both at the Centre and at the village level, have failed to adopt the family planning cause. Consequently, while it is officially claimed that family planning is at the very centre of planned development, actual efforts at implementing policy have been at best half-hearted and have fallen far short of any such claim.
