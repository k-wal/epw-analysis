Harris contends that "the irrational, non-economic and exotic aspects of the Indian cattle complex are greatly overemphasised at the expense of rationed economic and mundane interpretations" and urges that "explanation of taboos, customs and rituals associated with the management of Indian cattle be sought in the 'positive-functioned' and 'adaptive' processes of the ecological system of which they are a part rather than in the influence of Hindu theology". This article, however, argues that in Marvin Harris's thesis is summarised the entire defence of Hindu cow-worship garbed in pseudo-science. It is suggested here that a cattle population smaller in number but better fed than at present will make a better contribution in milk, traction and dung to human survival and well-being in India. Even if, because of prevailing technology and institutional arrangements in agriculture, it is not possible to reduce the number of draught animals, the large number of cows is wholly unjustified. A smaller number of better-fed cows will contribute more milk and dung and will give enough calves to replace the needed stock of drought animals.||V M Dandekar
