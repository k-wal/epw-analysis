However, a few studies have attempted to examine the effect of regulation on the production process of the firm and considered it as the additional unaccounted cost of compliance. This study, following the method developed by Morgenstern and others in 1998, estimates the hidden costs involved due to environmental regulation. Using firm-level primary survey data, this study of the Karur textile industrial cluster finds that there are hidden costs involved in complying with environmental regulation; the policy-maker has to take these additional costs into consideration.||S.

Illegal hooking in both the domestic and agriculture categories is rampant and probably constitutes the largest proportion of unaccounted energy. The reasons for this can be traced back to factors linked to the performance of the utility and the wider socio-political environment. It will not be possible to bring about improvements in the current set-up through primarily technological measures, instead reform packages must adopt a framework for intervention that encompasses technical, commercial, social and institutional aspects of the problem.||Sudhir Kumar Katiyar

It may also be a recipe for keeping the leadership of any movement concentrated among a male, upper caste elite as well as one for becoming politically irrelevant. What is needed is an alternative not only to the present system, but also to the left and ecological challenges to it.||Gail Omvedt

There is a need to understand why farmers are demanding quality power and yet not willing to pay for it. This paper, by three pumpset farmers from Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, is an exploration in this direction. It explores the spread of pumpset irrigation across the country and the reasons for the farmers' refusal to pay for the power they are consuming: a deliberate neglect of surface irrigation by planners and decision-makers, disparity vis-a-vis canal farmers, increasing input costs and declining incomes. The authors are, however, worried that the present trend in power consumption in agriculture (already covering 58 per cent of irrigated area) is ecologically unsustainable and ruinous to farmers, power utilities and the economy as a whole. A series of measures are suggested to overcome the crisis situation.||G. Narendranath,Uma Shankari,K. Rajendra Reddy

The deep disaffection in adivasi areas and among other forest-reliant peoples cannot be ignored but ecological concerns do exist and cannot be wished away. A two-track approach is needed to give force to the bill. One is to recognise rights in forests outside the protected area network and the other is to provide for a case-by-case evaluation of not only the biology but also the socio-economic character of settlements within parks and sanctuaries.||Mahesh Rangarajan

The conserving elite has generally seen communities living in and around reserved areas as people violating the conserved space; either whose rights need to be "settled" or who are rank encroachers. The Tiger Task Force report has brought an alternative image of this community into official discourse, that of potential partners in wildlife conservation, an image that had till now remained confined to a small group of environmental activists and academics.||Sudha Vasan

Together, these would help the programmes to operate on a more sustainable economic, environmental and financial basis. More effective subsidy structures could also unfold new avenues for negotiation among watershed communities and thereby strengthen the participatory processes for natural resource development across different activities and schemes.||Amita Shah

Gender sensitive provision of health care, especially obstetric and gynaecological services aimed at reducing gender inequity would allow women to overcome social constraints, even empowering them. This is the perspective informing a critical review of three textbooks in the two disciplines. The review aims to explore whether the textbooks sensitise students to the relationship between gender, social inequity and care-seeking behaviour, areas where reproductive rights are likely to be violated by providers, and the special needs of adolescents and older women.||Keerti Iyengar

This paper looks at how the memory of Morichjhanpi was evoked by the islanders to reveal their resentment about the unequal distribution of resources between them and the Royal Bengal tigers of the Sundarbans reserve forest. The government's primacy on ecology and its use of force in Morichjhanpi was seen by the Sundarbans islanders as a betrayal not only of refugees and of the poor and marginalised in general, but also of Bengali backward caste identity. At the same time, the reasons leading to the Morichjhanpi massacre have to be understood in relation to the long history which led to the partition of Bengal and the intricacies of caste, class and communal differences.||Annu Jalais

A public health perspective demands that the social and other contexts that determine women's health conditions be recognised. Combining these features, this paper adopts a women's health approach to a review of two textbooks on obstetrics and gynaecology.||Renu Khanna

This article provides academic criticism of the LEA's verdict highlighting how the body failed to incorporate the theoretical and methodological issues of damage assessment as such. The major conclusion is that unless the damage assessment exercise adheres to certain academic principles, the underlying objective of institutional intervention in issues relating to pollution and compensation will not be achieved adequately.||L.

Its model boldly advocates balancing nature conservation imperatives with emancipatory politics, yet it does not appear to have carefully analysed the many state level factors that are perhaps responsible for the collapse of tiger protection mechanisms in the country. Instead, the task force expounds a predominantly Delhi-centric vision of top-down tiger policy-making and implementation. This was perhaps inevitable given the composition of the task force and its reliance on the ministry of environment for information and ideas.||K. Ullas Karanth

The extent of the disaster and the uncertainties it gave rise to - in terms of knowledge, the impact on environment and livelihoods - have rarely been experienced in recent decades. On the other hand, coordination of relief must be truly on a globalised scale to prevent a 'second tragedy' that could result from improper rehabilitation efforts.||Lyla Mehta

Inhabitants of these 'peri-urban' regions are increasingly threatened by a deteriorating quality of life prompted by deforestation, water depletion and pollution as well as by the poor or almost non-existent mechanisms for sewage disposal. This article highlights the environmental dimensions associated with the spread of urban agglomerations by focusing on the problem of increased solid wastes in India's peri-urban regions. It looks at two local level initiatives formed to create a sustainable solid waste management system. But tasks such as solid waste management cannot be left to local level initiatives as community organisations lack sufficient resources or capacity to provide such a service in its entirety. Policy-makers need to give such areas more civic autonomy or provide, via the state government, a modicum of basic environmental services.||Annapurna Shaw

The question is: does mining influence the QOL of the local people? The study, conducted using a QOL tool, suggests that while there is a difference in objective conditions between mining and non-mining regions, there is no statistically significant difference in satisfaction levels between the two, except for the environmental domain. This is especially important in the case of women, who report higher satisfaction levels but overall have a lower access to resources.||Ligia Noronha,Subramanya Nairy

World primary energy consumption is projected to expand at an average annual growth rate of 2.1 per cent by 2020. About 70 per cent of the increase would be accounted for by non-OECD member economies, two-thirds of which are from the Asian region. The increase in demand for oil in Asia will most likely amplify the dependency on shipments from other regions (particularly west Asia). Ensuring energy security would therefore turn out to be a vital task. In east Asia, particularly, the achievement of the 'three Es' (economic development, energy security, and environmental preservation) can no longer be viewed as a task to be addressed by each country separately. Instead, it should be approached through region-wide cooperation - a goal of common interest.||Kokichi Ito,Li Zhidong,Ryoichi Komiyama

Given the overwhelming importance of agriculture in the state economy, a breakthrough in rainfed dryland agriculture can be said to hold the key to development of MP. The performance of the agro-ecological sub-regions within the state has been highly variable, adding another dimension to the unique significance of MP in the national scene. The state can be said to typify the two most important development experiences in India's rainfed agriculture - the near stagnation of the relatively high rainfall eastern region and the increasingly unsustainable tubewell-led agricultural development in the hard rock regions of the country. In our view, backwardness of large segments of Indian agriculture stems from an inability to develop an appropriate location-specific strategy of development for areas where the green revolution approach has no future.||P.
