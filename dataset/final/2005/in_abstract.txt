However, a few studies have attempted to examine the effect of regulation on the production process of the firm and considered it as the additional unaccounted cost of compliance. This study, following the method developed by Morgenstern and others in 1998, estimates the hidden costs involved due to environmental regulation. Using firm-level primary survey data, this study of the Karur textile industrial cluster finds that there are hidden costs involved in complying with environmental regulation; the policy-maker has to take these additional costs into consideration.||S.

However, design of the regulatory structure remains one of the key concerns and development of the gas market will be largely determined by the maturity of gas infrastructure, especially high pressure transmission lines.||Atanu Chakraborty

The dependence on fuelwood in rural areas implies that carbon sequestration or conservation cannot be achieved in isolation without fuelwood or integrated land use management or energy substitution policies. Kerosene, as the next preferred substitute, is expensive and also not easily available in the market. Using CPR lands without taking into consideration rural needs would thus result in conflicts and extreme hardship for the poor. Projects aimed at ensuring 'clean development mechanisms' would thus be placed under high participation as well as project risk and may not yield beneficial results in the end.||Haripriya Gundimeda

Narratives of the past continued to be written as they are to this day, and there continues to be a valuable gathering of new evidence. But the more challenging trend has been to pursue answers to questions that relate to why and how something happened rather than merely when and where. Actions and events had multiple causes and the priorities among these have to be justified by the evidence as well as by logical argument. There is also a need to integrate a variety of facets in constructing a historical context. History was an explanation of what happened in the past, an attempt to understand the past, and of basing this understanding on 'critical enquiry', incorporated into what is also called the 'historical method'. Historical understanding also has to be viewed as a 'process in time'.||Romila Thapar

Panchayats are institutions meant for village-level governance with an all-round development focus. They are provided with Constitutional rights, and their structural and functional network links them to larger state politics. They have also been given responsibilities, mostly as coordinators, in joint forest management (JFM). The forest protection committees (FPCs) and the voluntary forest protection groups, on the other hand, are newly established bodies meant for forest management alone. They have limited power to enforce their objectives and little autonomy to negotiate with other institutions. Yet, villagers use these forest forums, both formally and informally, to secure forest usufruct. The panchayats, on the other hand, are not always sensitive to the forest-based needs of the villagers. The paper argues that to make forest committees subservient to the panchayats and the dominant village polity would not make for effective forest management.||Manish Tiwary

By contrasting the situation with when the Baliraja movement began in the 1980s, in the hope of ensuring an equitable share and sustainable use of water for irrigation, this paper also attempts to understand the feasibility of institutional arrangements for sharing water on an equitable, efficient and sustainable basis. At the present juncture, it does not appear feasible to address all three issues simultaneously. The need rather is to address either the equity-sustainability or equity-efficiency solution. Both require institutional arrangements different from what the Baliraja movement envisioned.||Amalendu Jyotishi,Satyapriya Rout

Concern for energy security should promote maximisation of production, consequently large-scale plantations might well emerge. In another approach, community and small farmers could be promoted through cooperatives, panchayati raj institutions and the like.

Competition is needed in a futures market but to create healthy liquidity, facilitate orderly hedging and price making, and not between different exchanges for organising futures business in the same commodity contract. Not only does liquidity tend to become fractured in the latter case, research and development of new commodity products may come to a halt for fear that others would copy the products of successful exchanges without any costs.||Madhoo Pavaskar

The reasons for this can be traced back to factors linked to the performance of the utility and the wider socio-political environment.

The findings in this paper point to the fact that despite 10 years of collaborative forest management the hierarchical and unequal relationship between the state and local people has not changed in many places. As shown by the Harda experience, the bureaucratic mode of participation encouraged by the state fosters an inequality that has drawn criticism from tribal organisations. The conflict manifests itself in everyday issues that arise in the implementation of participatory forest management within the inherently hierarchical social structure and a development paradigm still dominated by a relatively unaccountable and paternalistic state.||Bhaskar Vira

The destruction of forest cover has ruined the Birhors' traditional livelihood occupation of rope making and the pursuit of alternative activities such as agriculture has been beset with problems. Contrary to the commonly held view, the Birhor population has not been diminishing; rather they are getting redistributed as a result of the dismantling of their traditional economic activity.||Sohel Firdos

There is a need to understand why farmers are demanding quality power and yet not willing to pay for it. This paper, by three pumpset farmers from Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, is an exploration in this direction. It explores the spread of pumpset irrigation across the country and the reasons for the farmers' refusal to pay for the power they are consuming: a deliberate neglect of surface irrigation by planners and decision-makers, disparity vis-a-vis canal farmers, increasing input costs and declining incomes. The authors are, however, worried that the present trend in power consumption in agriculture (already covering 58 per cent of irrigated area) is ecologically unsustainable and ruinous to farmers, power utilities and the economy as a whole. A series of measures are suggested to overcome the crisis situation.||G. Narendranath,Uma Shankari,K. Rajendra Reddy

At issue was indigeneity, the politics of place and belonging in the Indian nation. The affiliation with Hindu nationalism marked a radical departure from the previous decade's politics when adivasis had asserted a separate tribal identity and sought to reclaim rights to resources. These claims, elaborated eloquently during the course of the anti-dam movement, were shaped and strengthened by globally circulating discourses about indigenous peoples. How did these discourses, and the distinctive meanings of adivasi indigeneity to which they lent themselves, come to be superseded? Instead of signifying a subaltern experience of adivasi dispossession and resistance, how are discourses of indigeneity deployed to support the claims of the Hindu Right, to disenfranchise religious minorities and legitimise a politics of hate? How do Bhilala adivasis participate in this transformation in the valences of indigeneity? This paper traces adivasi mobilisation across three sites: rights to place and natural resources, religious reform, and electoral representation, to examine how discourses of indigeneity are differently constructed and contested across the terrain of class, caste and citizenship.||Amita Baviskar

The deep disaffection in adivasi areas and among other forest-reliant peoples cannot be ignored but ecological concerns do exist and cannot be wished away. A two-track approach is needed to give force to the bill. One is to recognise rights in forests outside the protected area network and the other is to provide for a case-by-case evaluation of not only the biology but also the socio-economic character of settlements within parks and sanctuaries.||Mahesh Rangarajan

Where they have not been labelled as encroachers and arbitrarily evicted, adivasis have also contributed to the ranks of people displaced by development projects. The proposed bill seeking to accord recognition to those scheduled tribes that once enjoyed such customary rights, is an attempt to set right historical injustices.

This paper looks at how the memory of Morichjhanpi was evoked by the islanders to reveal their resentment about the unequal distribution of resources between them and the Royal Bengal tigers of the Sundarbans reserve forest. The government's primacy on ecology and its use of force in Morichjhanpi was seen by the Sundarbans islanders as a betrayal not only of refugees and of the poor and marginalised in general, but also of Bengali backward caste identity. At the same time, the reasons leading to the Morichjhanpi massacre have to be understood in relation to the long history which led to the partition of Bengal and the intricacies of caste, class and communal differences.||Annu Jalais

The resistance against the colonial order and the zamindars soon transformed itself into a broad-based struggle for a homeland, a demand that figured in similar protest movements during the colonial period. These movements were largely unsuccessful, yet their legacy lives on.

In more recent decades, however, the intrepid and often epic struggles of project affected people have not only succeeded in raising grave doubts about the net public benefits of mega dams, they have also led to an incremental, even if grudging and still highly inadequate acknowledgement under public policy and law, of the rights of the affected peoples.

By comparing irrigation institutions under different property rights, the study identifies the significant factors that contribute to the success and sustainability of irrigation institutions. It is found that albeit the physical characteristics of irrigation systems and the heterogeneities of the members of the user groups do have an impact on the outcome, it is the institutional environment as reflected in the presence of clear as well as flexible systems of rules and regulations, enforcement mechanisms, nesting and networking of such institutions, etc, that have become the most crucial determinants.||Vineetha Menon,Antonyto Paul,K.

Land alienation, soil degradation, wild animal attacks, and declining access to forests have debilitated the livelihood base of this tribal community. Benefit cost analyses and stakeholder discussions reveal that millet-based dry farming with adoption of soil conservation or growing perennials on field bunds are economically efficient relative to current practices and enjoy stakeholder acceptance. Some other economically superior alternate land-uses are not acceptable locally, indicating the care with which tribal development policies need to be made.||Seema Purushothaman

An in-depth case analysis of 22 WUAs functioning in the Mahanadi Reservoir Project Complex is also presented. An institutional analysis framework was used to diagnose strengths and weaknesses of PIMS at macro and micro levels. The paper suggests that the political and bureaucratic will to share power with farmers can help improve not only the performance of PIMS but also promote the goals of sustainable management of scarce irrigation water resources.||Dinesh K.

Its model boldly advocates balancing nature conservation imperatives with emancipatory politics, yet it does not appear to have carefully analysed the many state level factors that are perhaps responsible for the collapse of tiger protection mechanisms in the country. Instead, the task force expounds a predominantly Delhi-centric vision of top-down tiger policy-making and implementation. This was perhaps inevitable given the composition of the task force and its reliance on the ministry of environment for information and ideas.||K. Ullas Karanth

The extent of the disaster and the uncertainties it gave rise to - in terms of knowledge, the impact on environment and livelihoods - have rarely been experienced in recent decades. On the other hand, coordination of relief must be truly on a globalised scale to prevent a 'second tragedy' that could result from improper rehabilitation efforts.||Lyla Mehta

Presumably, one can understand the IWT better if it is read in light of the internationally recognised customary rules on water sharing, including principles of equitable and reasonable utilisation, which are decisive in the absence of a bilateral water treaty. The State is not responsible for factual injury but only for legal injury in this field. The World Court applied the UN Convention on International Watercourses before its entry into force in order to resolve the dam dispute between Hungary and Slovakia. This is instructive for the Baglihar project dispute. Having a protocol to IWT is legally permissible, provided that the renegotiation of IWT for concluding a protocol is undertaken on a functional plan devoid of political aspects and strictly conforming to the IWT. This will help incorporate the contemporary principles of international watercourse law, including all customary principles in this field. This is crucial to balance the rights and duties of the riparian states and for the holistic and integrated water resources management of the Indus river system.||Muhammed Siyad A. C.

Nearly a quarter of the population of the state consists of members of the scheduled tribes, who have historically been one of the most disadvantaged sections of Indian society. In many respects, MP typifies the most difficult problems faced by the poorest regions of India. For this reason alone a study of MP's development trajectory would be instructive. An understanding of MP's development experience can also help us fathom some of the limitations of mainstream economic theory. With some creativity and imagination, it could enable formulation of new and effective strategies to tackle the most complex challenges of our time. This special edition of the EPW researches a few dimensions of the social, economic and political dynamics in the state.||Mihir Shah

The study finds that the project was carried out rapidly and has largely met its aim of supplying sufficient and safe water. A comparison of this project with national-level projects throws up substantially higher capital costs for the former. This, however, has to be weighed against the better quality as well as operation and maintenance of the AP project.||C. H. Shah

The Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal's (NWDT) order issued in 1979 has since been the reference point for all water development plans in the basin. The aspect of this order that this paper focuses on is the lack of any reference to groundwater when fixing allocation between the party states. It is a well-documented fact that conditions of heavy groundwater extraction often lead to decline in stream flows. This report is a critique of the premise on which the NWDT has fixed the inter-state allocation; it argues that the omission of groundwater withdrawals in the tribunal award is a serious oversight which may result in forced deviations from the decreed allocation. The case of the Narmada illustrates a condition generic to most other river basins in India - surface water allocation alone is inadequate if corresponding allocation of groundwater is not done.||Rahul Ranade

This paper investigates whether the enactment of policy instruments in Delhi affected ambient air quality and whether CNG conversion impinged on the pollution profile. To carry out the analysis, daily ambient air quality data was used from June 1999 to September 2003 from the busiest crossing in Delhi. The results do not indicate an all-round improvement in ambient quality as NOx rose after the conversion, whereas SPM and PM10 showed only a marginal fall; CO was the only parameter that showed a significant decline. But the problem so far has been addressed from a limited perspective and there are in fact three ways to approach it: reduction in emissions per unit of fuel used; fewer vehicle kilometres travelled in total and less fuel use per vehicle kilometre travelled. Unless all three modes are enmeshed, one would not expect the air quality to improve.||Vinish Kathuria

Inhabitants of these 'peri-urban' regions are increasingly threatened by a deteriorating quality of life prompted by deforestation, water depletion and pollution as well as by the poor or almost non-existent mechanisms for sewage disposal. This article highlights the environmental dimensions associated with the spread of urban agglomerations by focusing on the problem of increased solid wastes in India's peri-urban regions. It looks at two local level initiatives formed to create a sustainable solid waste management system. But tasks such as solid waste management cannot be left to local level initiatives as community organisations lack sufficient resources or capacity to provide such a service in its entirety. Policy-makers need to give such areas more civic autonomy or provide, via the state government, a modicum of basic environmental services.||Annapurna Shaw

In Said's own words, his early life was a series of displacements; later in life, he came to see western culture as fundamentally a creation of exiles. But to understand the idea of exile as Said construed it, would entail a 'contrapuntal' reading of it. For Said, exile was a 'permanent' state and not as conventionally understood, a transient stage. While this contrasted ironically with his empathy for the Palestinian cause - a nation of people in exile - for Said, the exilic mind was one that refuses to habituate itself to academic pieties, to accepted readings of texts, to the satisfactions of power and to the comforts of surrender to some transcendent force.||Vinay Lal

However, it does not follow that raising water prices is the natural next step for developing countries such as India. There are two broad reasons for this conclusion: first, in the near to medium term, canal water prices probably cannot be raised to the point where they significantly affect water demand. The negative impact on farm revenues would be too drastic and the policy would not find broad public support. Second, low water prices are often not the main reason behind the farmers' water-inefficient crop choices. Moreover, farm-level inefficiencies appear not to be the most significant ones on existing canals, nor are water prices the most significant prices driving irrigation demand. A better first step would be to enforce simple allocation rules - such as per-hectare rations - that would make the scarcity value of water immediately obvious. The analysis in this article is based on a study of one canal system in Maharashtra.||Isha Ray

The question is: does mining influence the QOL of the local people? The study, conducted using a QOL tool, suggests that while there is a difference in objective conditions between mining and non-mining regions, there is no statistically significant difference in satisfaction levels between the two, except for the environmental domain. This is especially important in the case of women, who report higher satisfaction levels but overall have a lower access to resources.||Ligia Noronha,Subramanya Nairy

Water Users' Associations in Andhra Pradesh||Often lack of political will is identified as the main reason for the tardy progress in irrigation reforms at the state level. Andhra Pradesh, however, has demonstrated the political will by initiating widespread irrigation reforms through legislation. This paper, based on the situation six years after Water Users' Associations came into existence, makes an attempt to provide a comprehensive view on the status and functioning of these associations in the state. It is argued that though substantial amounts of money were spent on the reform process, money was used mainly for improving the ailing irrigation systems rather than strengthening formal institutional structures. Despite the fact that WUAs are promoted as non-political institutions, "elite capture" and political involvement dominate their functioning. More importantly, devolution of powers to WUAs has still not taken place, as most of the important functions like assessment, collection of water charges, sanctioning of works, etc, remain in the hands of the irrigation department.||V.

World primary energy consumption is projected to expand at an average annual growth rate of 2.1 per cent by 2020. About 70 per cent of the increase would be accounted for by non-OECD member economies, two-thirds of which are from the Asian region. The increase in demand for oil in Asia will most likely amplify the dependency on shipments from other regions (particularly west Asia). Ensuring energy security would therefore turn out to be a vital task. In east Asia, particularly, the achievement of the 'three Es' (economic development, energy security, and environmental preservation) can no longer be viewed as a task to be addressed by each country separately. Instead, it should be approached through region-wide cooperation - a goal of common interest.||Kokichi Ito,Li Zhidong,Ryoichi Komiyama

Mega dams, in particular, create victims of development - mainly tribals who never share the gains of development. It can be said that the bigger the development project, the greater the centralised control over it. This centralisation has a bias in favour of large landholders, rich farmers, engineers, bureaucrats and politicians.||Biswaranjan Mohanty

In such contracts, all the risks are borne by the government while the companies do not invest a penny. Investment and expenditure becomes the responsibility of the government, and the companies only provide "super managers", with complete control over the management, finances and assets of the utility and get a fat annual fee. The adoption of the same model by the Delhi government for pursuing reforms in the water sector was met by protests. The now on-hold Delhi project is worth examining in some detail for the lessons it can teach us.||Amit Bhaduri,Arvind Kejriwal

Following a commitment made in the UPA's Common Minimum Programme, the proposed Forest Rights Bill aims to give legal entitlements to forest land that the adivasis may have been cultivating before 1980 as well as forest rights such as grazing and access to minor forest produce. A unique feature of the bill will be that the rights of adivasis will come with responsibilities for conserving the forests and protection of wildlife. The bill also seeks to end the exploitative hold of the forest department over the adivasis by recognising the gram sabha as the authority to recognise and verify claims.||Bela Bhatia

Given the overwhelming importance of agriculture in the state economy, a breakthrough in rainfed dryland agriculture can be said to hold the key to development of MP. The performance of the agro-ecological sub-regions within the state has been highly variable, adding another dimension to the unique significance of MP in the national scene. The state can be said to typify the two most important development experiences in India's rainfed agriculture - the near stagnation of the relatively high rainfall eastern region and the increasingly unsustainable tubewell-led agricultural development in the hard rock regions of the country. In our view, backwardness of large segments of Indian agriculture stems from an inability to develop an appropriate location-specific strategy of development for areas where the green revolution approach has no future.||P.
