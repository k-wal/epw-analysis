While the tragedy of maternal mortality affects mainly the poorer sections, it is only very recently that serious attention has focused on the issue of 'safe motherhood'. This paper analyses the levels of safe motherhood in rural areas of Andhra Pradesh vis-a-vis other southern states; it also seeks to understand the perceptions and limiting causes that come in the way of safe motherhood. While data suggests that women in rural Andhra Pradesh experience safe motherhood, social and group perspectives reveal that many women are exposed to unsafe motherhood; very often non-biomedical causes influence the medical determinants of safe motherhood.||G.

However, for the 'impossible' to happen, for the two sides to break away from the suspicion that has long mired their relationship, two things are simultaneously needed - a greater measure of autonomy to the people of Kashmir on both sides and a commensurate relaxation in security. For any settlement to sustain itself over time, it needs to give both sides some degree of comfort.||Verghese Koithara

However, a few studies have attempted to examine the effect of regulation on the production process of the firm and considered it as the additional unaccounted cost of compliance. This study, following the method developed by Morgenstern and others in 1998, estimates the hidden costs involved due to environmental regulation. Using firm-level primary survey data, this study of the Karur textile industrial cluster finds that there are hidden costs involved in complying with environmental regulation; the policy-maker has to take these additional costs into consideration.||S.

The unique success of the STD/HIV Intervention Programme (SHIP) in Sonagachi can be attributed mostly to the sex workers' active participation in its structure, decision-making and implementation through their association called Durbar Mahila Samanwaya Committee (DMSC, popularly known as Durbar). The valiant struggle for empowerment against the powerful vested in the sex trade by the poor, socially stigmatised and extremely vulnerable Sonagachi sex workers through a collective of their own can herald the beginning of a silent revolution among sex workers in the Indian as well as global arena.||Moni Nag

The present situation relies on large capital inflows into the US, but the concentration of investment in the highest-income regions of the world is socially damaging, destabilising and prejudicial to the effective development of resources in the world as a whole.

Examining women's access to higher education, it discusses the impact of current socio-economic and political realities on women's participation in science education and research. Not only is there a disjuncture between professed policy statements and prevailing ground realities, certain assumptions about class, caste or gender operate here unquestioned. The resultant anomalies have created a major gap in women's access to education and they are likely to increase, which has implications not only for gender equity, but also for the future of theoretical research in the country.||Veena Poonacha

More than half the population lives in slums. Residential construction for rental for the middle and lower income groups stopped half a century ago, because of the Rent Act, and shows no signs of revival. There is widespread urban blight.

Questions are raised about the utility of the prevailing export promotion schemes, even while these interventions are considered necessary to keep India's exports competitive in the international market. The appreciation of the rupee vis-Ã -vis the US dollar raises concerns regarding its adverse consequences on export performance. This paper observes a positive association between exchange rate movements and exports, which defies the conventional wisdom. Instead of treating this phenomenon as perverse, as in the literature, the paper underscores the crucial role of explicit or implicit subsidies and market structure. The paper argues for a reorientation of India's export strategy.||Jayanta Kumar Mallik

However, a necessary condition for the transformation of panchayats into local governments is devolution of powers, resources and functions to them and capacity building among the elected representatives. This paper analyses the functioning of the elected representatives at the gram panchayat level in Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. In Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, elected ward members show poor awareness of powers and responsibilities, but Kerala is different. In Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, panchayats are perceived as agents of state governments, whereas in Kerala they are taken as local governments. In all three states, panchayat presidents understand the legislation better but planning for development is a far cry as little effort seems to have gone into capacity building and devolution of powers and resources. Unless larger powers and resources are devolved and elected representatives are trained, local government will be a dream.||D. Narayana

Pakistan may be increasingly dominated by urban middle class factions and groups and has an "urban, modern, feel to it". Unlike other countries where the rising urban middle classes have struggled for collective social emancipation and democracy, Pakistan's middle classes, as this paper argues, have preferred to become partners of authoritarian and military governments. Moreover, Pakistan's experiment with democracy in the 1990s was one that was controlled and dominated by the military; thus, the idea of democracy itself has found few enthusiasts in Pakistan.||S.

The twin objectives of a commercial bank, i e, acquiring deposits and advancing credit cannot be attained without good banking habits of the people. Therefore, people's banking habits seem to be a major factor that affects sustainability of the banks concerned. In microfinancing in India, self-help groups (SHGs), which recently came into existence as informal organisations, are linked to banks and its members are mainly women. This paper makes a modest attempt to examine whether there is any association between the growth of SHGs and the increase in female bank deposit accounts and whether SHGs have a tendency to influence account holding in formal banks. In the process, the paper tries to trace the socio-economic factors that determine deposit and credit account holdings (banking habits) in formal banks, among individuals and households.||Mahendra Varman P.

The interest savings for states have been very small. Moreover, as the states have had to swap long-term debt for loans of a shorter maturity, the changing profile may create frequent repayment obligations for the states and increase roll-over risk. Debt management policy should ensure that the states can borrow on terms comparable to those of the centre, so that the spread of interest rates between the debt of the centre and the states is reduced.||Pinaki Chakraborty

The most commonly employed headcount measures are the headcount ratio H and the aggregate headcount A. Each of these indices has its respective merits and disadvantages. In this note, a composite headcount index M*, which combines H and A, is presented. The poverty ranking of income distributions by M* attaches some weight to the ranking by each of H and A, and thereby avoids the possibly extreme judgment of either in isolation.||S. Subramanian

It finds that elected representatives were not able to properly articulate group-specific interests or to exercise their own judgment in panchayat decision-making, thus bringing into question the very notion of representation of marginalised groups through affirmative action. The representatives in a majority of cases were answerable to the elites of the village and remained under their control rather than exhibiting any accountability to citizens at large. Affirmative action thus, has not ensured the effective representation of disadvantaged groups in the panchayats with respect to the participation of elected members, their responsiveness to citizens' interests and accountability in local government.||Pratyusna Patnaik

Yet, the extractable coal reserves in the country are estimated to last only 50 to 60 years under current techno-economic conditions. Given that current power plants are operating at efficiencies far from optimum, there is an enormous scope for improvement. Thus, a national efficiency mission, modelled after the existing renovation and modernisation programme, must be directed towards raising power-plant efficiencies across the country, thereby ensuring better use of this finite resource. In addition, a focused vision must be developed to strategically deploy cleaner and more efficient coal technologies.||Ananth P. Chikkatur

The debates in the constituent assembly imply a tolerant rather than an encouraging approach of the state towards the minorities. This explains the stand of the Constitution-makers not to provide the promised fundamental rights automatically but to make the minorities assert their demands. As far as interpretation of Article 30 by the courts is concerned, one finds three trends. Firstly, the judgments are contextual, hence, many times, they are different, reflecting the personal convictions of the judges. This makes interpretation of the Article vague and subject to a constant struggle between the minorities and the state. Secondly, these judgments are more liberal with linguistic minorities than with the religious ones and, thirdly, they reflect a trend towards gradually reducing the scope of the Article, giving space to governmental regulations and control.||Ranu Jain

It finds that prevalent gender stereotypes get consistently reinforced in the analysis of family and community dynamics. Women's reproductive health needs only come into focus in discussions on family planning and the 'population problem'. Both the books examined were found lacking in class and gender specific research data on disease causation and management. It is apparent the authors pick up progressive ideas but fail to integrate them into the text. As a result, gender, equity and social justice in the analysis of health issues and health care needs appear as unintegrated concepts, easily ignored by student users of these books.||Kamaxi Bhate,Shrikala Acharya

The paper shows that religious diversity in India also has an economic dimension. A comparison of the average consumption level of religious groups for all India shows that the average monthly per capita expenditure of Muslims is the lowest in both rural and urban India. The average MPCE of Sikhs and Christians is the highest in rural and urban India, respectively. The prevalence, depth and severity of poverty are found to be the highest among the 'Others' in rural India and among Muslims in urban India. The immediate challenges are to formulate and implement 'inclusive' policies and it is hoped that the estimates of poverty computed in this paper will contribute to providing an empirical basis for the debates on the subject. We also hope that this paper will stimulate research towards state specific studies seeking to explain factors underlying poverty among different religious groups.||Rijo M. John,Rohit Mutatkar

Banks have been asked to raise credit to 50 per cent of GDP as against the present 35 per cent and bankers are expected to move away from the rigid lending policies pre-empted by the existing customer base. The new business opportunities need not be inconsistent with reforms and efficient business goals: higher profitability could be achieved by risk mitigation models and expansion of the share of non-fund businesses. A lesson in this for the monitoring authorities is to incorporate into their policies the considerations of a larger credit base and more importantly its wider distribution amongst sectors, regions and size classes.||EPW Research Foundation

However, given the degree of agrarian distress and problem of low wages and underemployment, the budget should have had a greater focus on and made higher allocations to agriculture and rural employment. Contrary to the claims, this, however, has not been the case. 'Bharat Nirman' is possible only if agriculture and employment are given their due share.||S. Mahendra Dev

23/4/2005-29/4/2005||microfinance||4416532||Mainstreaming of Indian Microfinance||A significant feature of microfinance in India is that it has been built upon the existing banking infrastructure. In the process, it has obviated the need for the creation of a new institutional set up or introduction of a separate legal and regulatory framework. In the linkage model, the financial resources are being sourced from regular banking channels as well as members' savings. Thus the problems related to regulation and supervision of microfinance institutions (MFIs), the accessing of public deposits by MFIs and reliance on donor and grant funding are obviated. With the group acting as a collateral substitute, this model also overcomes the intractable problem of collateral provision by the poor. It has to be realised that microfinance is a means or an instrument for development, not an end in itself. To assess the extent to which Indian microfinance has been able to achieve the goal of poverty eradication and fulfil its role as a means for development, requires in-depth impact assessments on an ongoing basis.||P.

The failure of the private sector in power in the state is attributed to a lack of proper planning, unaffordable tariffs, and the inability of the state electricity board to judiciously grant escrow covers. The ADB-assisted restructuring plan was pushed through in complete disregard of the lessons from Orissa's power sector restructuring exercise. In effect, it has been a lost decade; there is no improvement in the performance of the power sector in MP. Small consumers are burdened with multifold tariff hikes and the state government with subsidies. The paper also examines the role of the state electricity regulatory commission.||Nikit Abhyankar

The surcharge will play a critical role in managing the transition to competition as the electricity regulatory commissions try to balance the conflicting requirements of making open access economically attractive for HT consumers and protecting the financial health of licensees. This paper presents an overview of the recommendations made by various parties regarding the calculation of the surcharge and discusses some concerns about their application. The likely revenue loss for the licensees and the extent to which the various recommended methods compensate the utilities for the revenue loss are also assessed. There is a need to refocus on broader concerns if the transition to competition is to be made a little easier.||Daljit Singh

The dependence on fuelwood in rural areas implies that carbon sequestration or conservation cannot be achieved in isolation without fuelwood or integrated land use management or energy substitution policies. Kerosene, as the next preferred substitute, is expensive and also not easily available in the market. Using CPR lands without taking into consideration rural needs would thus result in conflicts and extreme hardship for the poor.

Narratives of the past continued to be written as they are to this day, and there continues to be a valuable gathering of new evidence. But the more challenging trend has been to pursue answers to questions that relate to why and how something happened rather than merely when and where. Actions and events had multiple causes and the priorities among these have to be justified by the evidence as well as by logical argument. There is also a need to integrate a variety of facets in constructing a historical context. History was an explanation of what happened in the past, an attempt to understand the past, and of basing this understanding on 'critical enquiry', incorporated into what is also called the 'historical method'. Historical understanding also has to be viewed as a 'process in time'.||Romila Thapar

But this one-sided focus neglects the responses of other sections of society who, while remaining relatively unaffected, are in ways instrumental in the creation of famine. Thus, the question of how famine is enacted and rendered persistent in a society is yet to be fully answered. This paper draws on observations of a field study conducted in a village in Orissa's Kalahandi district and looks at institutionalised socio-economic relationships and community transactions in the process of production. Famine, in this theoretical construct, appears as a long-drawn process of socio-economic and biological decline, in contrast to accepted notions of famine as an 'event'.||Arima Mishra

In spite of gradual liberalisation aimed at strengthening the operational efficiency of the financial system in the 1990s, it is observed that Indian banks are still not much differentiated in terms of input- or output-oriented technical efficiency and cost efficiency. However, they differ sharply in respect of revenue and profit efficiencies. Bank size, ownership, and being listed on the stock exchange are some of the factors that have a positive impact on average profit efficiency, and to some extent, revenue efficiency scores. Finally, the median efficiency scores of Indian banks, in general, and of bigger banks, in particular, have improved during the post-reform period.||Abhiman Das,Ashok Nag,Subhash C. Ray

We quantify here the impacts and identify which of the macro variables were significantly affected and which could not be the result of the reforms. For the analysis, the technique of interventions analysis of time-series is used. Two kinds of measures are noted: (a) the year-to-year effects, and, (b) the overall growth pattern, during 1991 to 2002-03 due to reforms for each of the variables. Private final consumption expenditure (PFCE), investment (GCF) and all the GDP variables except that of services were found to be substantially higher during the post-reforms period than what they would have been in the absence of the reforms.

Panchayats are institutions meant for village-level governance with an all-round development focus. They are provided with Constitutional rights, and their structural and functional network links them to larger state politics. They have also been given responsibilities, mostly as coordinators, in joint forest management (JFM). The forest protection committees (FPCs) and the voluntary forest protection groups, on the other hand, are newly established bodies meant for forest management alone. They have limited power to enforce their objectives and little autonomy to negotiate with other institutions. Yet, villagers use these forest forums, both formally and informally, to secure forest usufruct. The panchayats, on the other hand, are not always sensitive to the forest-based needs of the villagers. The paper argues that to make forest committees subservient to the panchayats and the dominant village polity would not make for effective forest management.||Manish Tiwary

While Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code is one of the most significant criminal law reforms protecting women's rights, it is not enough. We need to remember that criminal law is indeed a blunt tool for it is difficult to change police culture; though the law may consider domestic violence against women an offence, the police may still not comply and implement it effectively. In order to move towards an effective working of Section 498A, it is crucial that we adopt a new model of policing - the victim empowerment model, which will put in place pro-arrest procedures and social service networks at the police station. It is also important to have civil law remedies to provide protection to women victims of domestic violence and the recently passed Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Bill, 2005 is significant in that context.||Jayna Kothari

The politics of decolonisation followed by newly independent nations of the mid-20th century often displayed an uncritical emphasis on modernisation; development, that pursued with technology and tools of scientific progress, was a "catch-up" exercise with the west. However, with the globalisation of ideas and practices, commensurate with the "democratisation" of politics around the 1970s, hitherto marginalised groups also sought a more global, "deterritorialised" identity. The period saw the rise of post-structuralist and postmodern theories, that were opposed to the territorial imagination of the nation state. Currently, as humans, objects and practices continue to move seamlessly beyond nation states, this other side of decolonisation - representing the thoughts of the colonised on a "dialogue across differences" - remains vital but as yet an unfinished project.||Dipesh Chakrabarty

The recent emphasis of the Maoist movement has been on targeting the police and other state institutions, while remaining more or less silent on crucial issues such as hunger, starvation and corruption that are of concern to the people. The counterpart of rising militaristic activity is that open and democratic movements by the revolutionary groups, which were very strong in the 1980s, have taken a back seat in the state.||Bela Bhatia

Over the past decade new microfinance approaches designed to deliver finance to the poor have emerged and some have shown promise. However, empirical assessments of their reach or impact are still relatively few. Drawing on a recent rural access to finance survey of 6,000 households conducted by the authors, we empirically analyse the reach of the most dominant microfinance initiative, the SHG-bank linkage model. Based on this and international experience, the paper draws lessons for exploiting the potential of microfinance in India, outlines areas of concern for government policy towards this important sector, and suggests ways to scale up access to finance for the poor.||Priya Basu,Pradeep Srivastava

A key question in this regard is whether or not the harmonisation of patent laws, through the adoption of the SPLT, marks a step towards introducing a TRIPS-plus regime in terms of the obligations of signatory countries. It finds that flexibilities currently available under TRIPS could be considerably eroded if patent harmonisation initiated under the WIPO Patent Agenda moves towards higher and stricter standards. Clear linkages between the TRIPS and SPLT negotiating processes have not been established at the multilateral or domestic level in developing countries and there is an urgent need for these nations to make their presence felt at the SPLT negotiations.||Biswajit Dhar,R.

Such a review would seem to be not only an empirical necessity, but also a moral obligation. When this overdue assessment is eventually made, it will once again bring to the fore the fundamental differences on Iraq which divided the UN security council throughout the years. The fate of a people became collateral damage, a euphemism for death and destitution. Important and final facts have now become available for the period of the oil-for-food programme. This allows a thorough analysis of major causes of the desperate human conditions in Iraq. As the Volcker committee's report occupies the headlines it is important to remember that the original crime was the indiscriminate use of sanctions against the people of Iraq.||Hans-Christof von Sponeck

Since the 1990s, the approach has been more cautious emphasising the "protectional" aspects as opposed to the "promotional" dimensions of microfinance. A defining feature of the micro-credit scenario in India, as opposed to the Bangladeshi experience, has been the significant role played by public sector formal lending institutions in the establishment and expansion of financial intermediation through self-help groups. Today, the SHG-bank linkage programme is arguably the world's largest microfinance programme in terms of outreach. In the light of issues and concerns raised by research on the Bangladesh microfinance experience, this paper asks whether these could adequately serve as a lens through which Indian SHG-based microfinance could be critically examined, given the crucial organisational and institutional differences between Indian and Bangladeshi microfinance.||K.

Moreover, none of these definitions satisfy the criterion that fiscal deficit in a given year should equal the sum of increase in debt and monetisation. This paper builds on this basic criterion to derive a theoretically consistent and appropriate definition of debt. The definition is then used to estimate debt for 18 non-special category states and 10 special category states for the period 1989-90 to 2003-04 and obtain effective interest rates for these states. We observe that non-special category states have a significantly greater probability of fiscal sustainability than the special category states. Moreover, when the trend in the proportion of debt of each state in the aggregate of all states is compared with trends in similar proportions of fiscal transfers from the centre and that in the primary deficit on own account, we find that certain states have benefited by largesse from the centre despite a consistently bad performance, while certain performing states have been penalised by reduced fiscal transfers.||Ravindra H.

At the present juncture, it does not appear feasible to address all three issues simultaneously. The need rather is to address either the equity-sustainability or equity-efficiency solution. Both require institutional arrangements different from what the Baliraja movement envisioned.||Amalendu Jyotishi,Satyapriya Rout

Analysis of Findings from South Asia||Opinions on the impact of microfinance have been divided between those who see it as a "magic bullet" for women's empowerment and others who are dismissive of its abilities as a cure-all panacea for development. This paper seeks to examine the empirical evidence on the impact of microfinance with respect to poverty reduction and empowerment of poor women. It becomes apparent that while access to financial services can and does make vital contributions to the economic productivity and social well-being of poor women and their households, it does not "automatically" empower women, just as with other interventions, such as education, political quotas, etc, that seek to bring about a radical structural transformation that true empowerment entails. These other interventions simply constitute different entry points into this larger project, each with the potential for social transformation, but each is contingent on context, commitment and capacity if this potential is to become a reality.||Naila Kabeer

"Early Bolshevism" refers to Bolshevism before Stalin's consolidation of power. Marx's notion of post-capitalist society - "communism", "socialism", "society of free and associated producers" - envisaged a society that has left behind all the vehicles of exploitation and oppression of the old society, such as state, commodity production, money, wage labour, to name the principal ones. This is contrasted with the notion of socialism as it appears in the writings of the early Bolsheviks - Lenin, Trotsky, Bukharin and Preobrazhensky. It turns out that the socialism emerging from the works of these avowed "Marxists" is the exact opposite of the socialism one finds in Marx's extant texts.||Paresh Chattopadhyay

However, the Act is only one among several other legal instruments expected to have a significant impact on the future development of agriculture. This article argues for the widening of the patents debate to include agriculture, which under the current WTO regime, is now bound to its regulations relating to trade and intellectual property. It also looks at several legal instruments, already in place or in the offing, examining them together in the light of the linkages and overlaps between them. At the same time, these instruments need to be examined in context of the international framework, for increasingly, international treaties and conventions have come to exercise some influence at the national level.||Philippe Cullet

This result is expected in an emerging economy undergoing a process of deregulation. In terms of bank groups, domestic banks appear to be more efficient than foreign banks.||Rudra Sensarma

It has dwindled to a quasifiscal agency with a consequent loss of status and influence. India has political and fiscal federalism, but lacks monetary federalism. The case for an independent RBI derives from the doctrine of separation of powers both to close India's democratic deficit and to insulate monetary policy from politics. Independence implies accountability, transparency and the creation of an executive (not advisory) monetary policy committee; revamping its inflated and overly hierarchical organisation; and divestiture of supervisory and quasi-fiscal functions. The agenda calls for an early creation of a high-powered commission to help legislate a constitutionally independent federal RBI.||Anand Chandavarkar

The dissemination of these records to the farmers too is being done in the traditional offline manner. Several reforms are being suggested in this paper. First, the government should use aerial survey technology for preparing cadastral maps and land surveys and put them in a web-based service delivery system. Once ownership and other records are on the web, people would file online applications for correction. Thus records can be corrected with speed and reduced contact between people and the bureaucracy. Second, laws relating to prevention of fragmentation should be done away with. Third, the registration office should be computerised along with CLR. Fourth, there should be only one department to maintain land records as well as to register land sales, and the work of registration should be done by the revenue department itself. Lastly, as against registration of the deed first and correction of records later, registration should be done only after verification of the title and genuineness of the transaction.||Naresh C.

This article looks at possible reasons for the act's retention in Maharashtra, when it has been repealed by most other states. It suggests other alternatives to ensure that the laudable objectives as originally envisioned by the act could still be achieved.||Vidyadhar K. Phatak

Flows of private capital through FIIs have in recent years augmented forex reserves in emerging markets. In India, over the past decade, FIIs have displaced domestic mutual funds in importance in the equity market. Their shareholding in the Sensex companies is large enough for them to be able to move the market. The volatility in portfolio inflows to India has been modest compared to other emerging markets. As domestic funds grow in size and pension funds enter the equity market, that would provide a measure of self-insurance against volatility occasioned by FII flows. The real problem caused by variations in FII inflows from year to year is not stock market volatility but difficulties posed in management of money supply and the exchange rate.||T. T. Ram Mohan

These groups involve as many as 19.2 million people, many of whom work on a voluntary basis. This is equivalent to 2.7 million paid employees and 3.4 million full-time volunteers, a total of 6.1 million which is considerable given the fact that central government employees in 2000 numbered only 3.3 million. Contrary to popular perceptions, as much as 51 per cent of the receipts are self-generated, and only 36 per cent come from the government as grants and loans and a mere 7 per cent from foreign sources.||S.

Competition is needed in a futures market but to create healthy liquidity, facilitate orderly hedging and price making, and not between different exchanges for organising futures business in the same commodity contract. Not only does liquidity tend to become fractured in the latter case, research and development of new commodity products may come to a halt for fear that others would copy the products of successful exchanges without any costs.||Madhoo Pavaskar

Although Virasam has undergone such harassment earlier, the question that needs to be answered is why a writers' association, which has done so much for the development of Telugu literature, should be declared "unlawful".||N.

The implementation of TRIPS worldwide represents a step in the opposite direction and its impact on the production and innovative capacity of developing countries in knowledge intensive sectors is not at all clear. Taking India as representative of a technologically advanced developing country, and the biotech based segment of the pharmaceutical industry as an example of an emerging knowledge intensive sector, we examine the possible impact of TRIPS on the incentives and ability to innovate. The conclusion is that TRIPS is not likely to have a significant impact on incentives for innovation creation in the biotech segment.||Shyama V. Ramani,Augustin Maria

The furore about Tytler and others served, however, to divert attention from the fact that the commission has failed - like the ones before it - to go to the bottom of the violence of 1984 and offers little hope of justice to the victims. What the report leaves us with is the realisation that political power gives immunity and that the pursuit of justice is an illusion when the state is complicit in the violence.||Uma Chakravarti
01/1/2005-07/1/2005||special articles||4416012||Unravelling a Conceptual Muddle: India's Poverty Statistics in the Light of Basic Demand Theory||For some time now, there has been growing dissatisfaction with the conceptual basis of India's official poverty statistics, with specific reference to the manner in which the Planning Commission has sought to address the 'identification' problem in poverty measurement. Unfortunately, this has evoked little in the way of official acknowledgement, and still less in the way of official rectification; apart from which, the faulty procedures underlying the official methodology have been replicated in a number of 'non-official' scholarly studies. The present paper makes an effort to identify, within an analytical framework of elementary demand theory, the source of the conceptual muddle, and to indicate how seriously misleading it could be to continue to employ the official methodology (or variants thereof) in assessments of income poverty in India.||S.

India should also draw lessons from the restrictions placed on the expansion of organised retailing, in terms of sourcing, capital requirement, zoning, etc, in other Asian countries. This article comments on the retail FDI report that was commissioned by the department of consumer affairs and suggests the need for a more comprehensive study.||E. A. S. Sarma

Indeed, the state level gender development index estimated by several scholars places Kerala ahead of other states. But a decomposition of this index reveals that the top position in education and health masks the poor employment profile of women in the state. Besides, the state witnesses negative trends in women's property rights, rapid growth and spread of dowry and rising gender-based violence. This paper engages critically with gender performance in select dimensions of well-being.||Praveena Kodoth,Mridul Eapen

02/4/2005-08/4/2005||budget 2005-06||4416420||Recent Individual Income Tax Reform||An attempt is made here to evaluate recent reform of the non-corporate tax structure by examining its current base, the rate structure, selected administration reforms and likely implications of these reforms for compliance costs and compliance. There are four main conclusions. Tax base reforms have increased the differential treatment of income from different sources. Nevertheless reforms stop short of steps needed to fully capture offsetting benefits from reduced compliance costs and increased tax compliance. Second, the restructured tax rates are the most liberal since the 1960s, except marginally for individual taxpayers close to the exemption limit. Third, however, reforms are likely to increase individual compliance costs as a percentage to taxes collected. Fourth, compliance and so the revenue impact of recent reforms is likely to have been positive though moderate.||Arindam Das-Gupta
22/1/2005-28/1/2005||special articles||4416103||Gandhi and Ahmedabad, 1915-20||On his return to Ahmedabad after successful experiments with satyagraha in South Africa, Gandhi rediscovered and strove to revive Ahmedabad's business-oriented yet pluralistic traditions of coexistence. As newspapers of the period and other contemporary accounts reveal, Gandhi effectively utilised these principles in the varied struggles he led to promote the cause of freedom, peace, communal harmony and social justice. Based on his initial experiments and campaigns, Gandhi developed his own unique vision and a plan of action that was based on his understanding of the complexity that defined colonial India and his concern for its many underprivileged. At the present juncture, this very same Gandhian legacy appears turned upside down by the politics of divisiveness.||Makrand Mehta

Any effort at upscaling thus needs to be viewed with caution as it could actually lead to increased failures and credit indiscipline in the field. In the meanwhile, globally there is a visible trend of the commercialisation of microfinance, with NGOs transforming themselves into regulated financial institutions or non-banking financial companies and commercial banks entering the business of microfinance.||Tara S.

It lies in the eclectic and diverse nature of Islam in this part of the world and the relative moderation of India's public policies, except for the brief interregnum when the right-wing Hindu nationalist forces were at the helm of national affairs.||Imtiaz Ahmad

The latter is at best minimal because civil society's grievances against the exam system are 'seasonal' and minor in nature; it is still to perceive that the present system of education and examination itself is a major hindrance for child development.||Krishna Kumar
01/10/2005-07/10/2005||special articles||4417232||Voice and Agency of Teachers: Missing Link in National Curriculum Framework 2005||The National Curriculum Framework 2005 articulates a new vision of the school curriculum as an inclusive space that extends beyond the conventional textbooks into the realm of teaching-learning processes. While this vision has the potential to enable education to become a critical catalyst in the process of social transformation, it fails to engage enough with a most crucial link - the agency of the teacher. The proactive engagement of the schoolteacher with processes of curriculum redesign is a necessary condition to ensure the success of the NCF. However, as this paper argues, radical change in the school curriculum without changing the central reality of teachers in Indian classrooms can do little to alter educational processes and outcomes. The exercise of curriculum renewal must attend to the equally vital need of transforming the state of teacher education in India, if the NCF's vision of schools as sites of social transformation leading to an egalitarian and just social order in the near future, is to ever become a reality.||Poonam Batra

Illegal hooking in both the domestic and agriculture categories is rampant and probably constitutes the largest proportion of unaccounted energy. The reasons for this can be traced back to factors linked to the performance of the utility and the wider socio-political environment. It will not be possible to bring about improvements in the current set-up through primarily technological measures, instead reform packages must adopt a framework for intervention that encompasses technical, commercial, social and institutional aspects of the problem.||Sudhir Kumar Katiyar

In Madhupur, labourers are hired for task specific operations whereas in Chandina they are hired on a daily wage basis. Thus larger farms in Madhupur can employ labour at low transaction costs and hence output per acre is higher as compared to smaller farms. In Chandina, the quality of supervision performed by family labourers falls as farm size increases and hence output per acre is lower as compared to smaller farms.||Kazi Ali Toufique
22/10/2005-28/10/2005||issues in measurement of poverty||4417325||Of Calories and Things: Reflections on Nutritional Norms, Poverty Lines and Consumption Behaviour in India||There are two main criticisms of the poverty line, which are in some ways interrelated. The first is that even though the poverty line ensured the consumption of the normative calorie intake in 1973-74, it no longer does so. The second questions the very use of calorie intake as a measure of nutritional adequacy, arguing that such a unidimensional measure may do more harm than good in the measurement of poverty and design of poverty alleviation instruments. This paper seeks to address these criticisms of the extant methodology of deriving the poverty line from an economist's perspective and attempts to bring out some issues which call for further research.||Pronab Sen
12/3/2005-18/3/2005||special articles||4416333||'Seeing' the State in India||Since the early 1990s, civil society organisations have been involved with governments in an effort to 'mobilise and organise the poor with a view to empowering them', converting them from 'passive recipients of doles to active participants in planned development'. But what does this partnering of the state by civil society in crucial areas of collective life imply for the autonomy of the latter? And does the involvement of civil society mean that the state, instead of strengthening its own institutions for the delivery of basic services, has actually liberated itself from obligation to its citizens? A contrary view, however, emerges from a survey undertaken in a few residential areas of Delhi. Responses across the board indicated that citizens had high expectations from the state in spite of the fact that the state has begun to delegate more and more of its responsibilities to civil society organisations. As this article argues, such political preferences are the outcome of historical processes and how the development state came into being in post-independent India.||Neera Chandhoke

While the slum-dwellers have been blamed for their illegal constructions, it is the trio comprising the political class, the developers and builder lobby as well as the corporate sector that is largely to blame.

The foundation of the bill itself, or the objectives on which the entire edifice is constructed, is so flawed that its architecture cannot be remedied by improvements in specific components. Given the many episodes where democratically elected state administrations have been openly partisan and neglectful, or even actively participated in the massacre of segments of the populace, the bill sets out, perversely, to vest those same governments with even more powers.||Harsh Mander

This paper probes two allied issues: firstly, the isolation of the firm specific factors which determine the presence of bank nominee directors on boards and secondly, whether companies, with bank nominee directors exhibit better performance/governance than companies with no banker representation on their boards. A Probit model estimated over a cross-section of Indian manufacturing firms for 2003, indicates that bankers on boards seem to exert a healthy impact on the companies. In fact, large public limited companies are likely to exhibit banker representation, primarily in their role as expertise providers. The evidence from Tobit model reconfirms these results.||D. M.

Flow of Funds and Matrices of Stock Balances. It highlights the by now obvious fact that the US expansion was allowed to continue by the exacerbation of unprecedented global financial imbalances. By exploring econometrically the patterns of aggregate demand, it concludes that for the US economy to keep growing at such a pace, continuing asset appreciation (real estate and equities) and capital inflows from abroad are required. Such a path is precarious, and potentially hazardous for the US and the world economy because it relies on ever-accumulating debts. There seem not to exist market-driven alternatives which would not involve serious macro-financial crises. Unless a congenial, policy-coordinated solution is found, the inertia may prevail... until it lasts.||Alex Izurieta

The major push factor was lack of employment opportunities in the place of origin caused by drought and the pull factor was a favourable employment situation in the destination areas. After migration there seems to be a sizeable improvement in self-employment and regular salaried jobs for women. But the concentration of women in the informal sector to the extent of 82 per cent is an indication of their disadvantaged position in the urban labour market. Weighing the gains and losses, the study concludes that migration has helped migrant households avoid hunger, starvation and death, though it has failed to improve the economic well-being of about 43 per cent of the families, particularly the female headed households. To alleviate poverty, the government's attention should be directed towards combating population movement via rural development and also improving the living conditions of those who had already moved.||S.

The findings in this paper point to the fact that despite 10 years of collaborative forest management the hierarchical and unequal relationship between the state and local people has not changed in many places. As shown by the Harda experience, the bureaucratic mode of participation encouraged by the state fosters an inequality that has drawn criticism from tribal organisations. The conflict manifests itself in everyday issues that arise in the implementation of participatory forest management within the inherently hierarchical social structure and a development paradigm still dominated by a relatively unaccountable and paternalistic state.||Bhaskar Vira

However, the Patents Bill made 74 amendments to the Patents Act of 1970, thus taking it much beyond the requirements of TRIPS. While Parliament has modified some of these amendments, it has chosen not to incorporate all the flexibilities that are available within TRIPS to safeguard public interest.

The destruction of forest cover has ruined the Birhors' traditional livelihood occupation of rope making and the pursuit of alternative activities such as agriculture has been beset with problems.

The strategic consideration in the product market may induce Indian corporates to take on higher debt in order to gain strategic advantage. Using a balanced panel of 538 Indian manufacturing firms over the period 1989 to 2000, the paper studies the relationship between short- and long-term debt and sales performance (export as well as total sales). In the case of long-term debt, firms take time to build their infrastructure. Hence, considering a longer time horizon of two years and seven years of taking the loan, the paper finds that long-term debt boosts sales growth of firms belonging to the top 50 and large business houses. However, long-term debt is inconsequential for total growth of sales for smaller group and unaffiliated firms. The study finds empirical evidence on the interplay between the financial structure and product market performance in the Indian corporate sector.||Arindam Bandyopadhyay

However, what remains a matter of concern is the fact that apart from India, none of the other south Asian countries have adopted domestic violence legislation or made the necessary changes to anti-trafficking legislation. Progress to ensure security and a world without violence for women has been slow but its pace especially in the last decade has been heartening. Violence against women, as borne out by research from around the world, can be effectively combated if a healthy partnership prevails between women's groups and the state apparatus.||Radhika Coomaraswamy

Unequal gender relations distribute the burden of poverty disproportionately on women. They can also be the cause of poverty among women and girls in non-poor families. These unequal relations therefore need to be addressed both as a cause and as a factor in the intensification of poverty. Empowerment of women has to go beyond mere instrumentalism and begin with first addressing questions of women's agency, their well-being and self-esteem and then that of their families and communities.||Govind Kelkar

The introduction of the two-child norm, however, has been double-edged in its implications. This paper presents the findings of a field study across five states where the two-child qualification norm has been implemented in local bodies. It reveals the dichotomy that exists at higher policy-making levels where this measure is seen as conducive and exemplary in view of the need to raise small families while at grassroot levels the perception is widespread that the norm is coercive in its impact. More powerful classes and castes have been better able to circumvent the provisions of this norm; women too have become its unintentional victims. The introduction of this norm should have proceeded in tandem with other much needed measures of upliftment in backward areas, such as education, health care and the provision of counselling facilities.||Nirmala Buch

In India, colonial sovereignty was often reduced to domination, yet 'internal wars' waged on the basis of religious, caste or even linguistic divisions, continued. Post-colonial India remains thus, a social body perpetually traversed by relations of war. As this article argues, neither colonial rule, nationalism nor even democracy in India has seen the production of a sovereignty necessary for the construction of a 'society' amenable to disciplinary power and its politics. Indian democracy thus furnishes an interesting case where the political task of creating the typically modern mix of 'sovereignty' (rights) and disciplinary domination arises not before but after the coming of universal adult franchise and a democratic polity.||Dipesh Chakrabarty

There is a need to understand why farmers are demanding quality power and yet not willing to pay for it. This paper, by three pumpset farmers from Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh, is an exploration in this direction. It explores the spread of pumpset irrigation across the country and the reasons for the farmers' refusal to pay for the power they are consuming: a deliberate neglect of surface irrigation by planners and decision-makers, disparity vis-a-vis canal farmers, increasing input costs and declining incomes. The authors are, however, worried that the present trend in power consumption in agriculture (already covering 58 per cent of irrigated area) is ecologically unsustainable and ruinous to farmers, power utilities and the economy as a whole. A series of measures are suggested to overcome the crisis situation.||G. Narendranath,Uma Shankari,K. Rajendra Reddy

A Case Study of Indian Manufacturing||This paper uses firm level data for the period 1989-2001 to analyse the working of competition in India's manufacturing sector. It examines the impact of greater competition on profit mark-up over the last decade. The econometric analysis of the factors determining mark-up indicates that, contrary to received wisdom, trade openness by itself does not act to reduce the profit mark-up. The paper also investigates the degree of competitiveness defined as the Lerner price-cost margin. The analysis indicates that the estimated margins are in general high over the 1990s across all industries and in most of the industries considered these margins have been increasing over the second-half of the 1990s. The market by itself does not bring about competitive outcomes. The regulatory agencies probably have a crucial role to ensure a level playing field.||Manoj Pant,Manoranjan Pattanayak

They need not always contest the state project; in fact, they may take decisions, based on their own particular circumstances, that unintentionally bolster the nationalist state project of defining borders. The paper discusses the migration of harijans from TharParkar, Sindh into Kachchh in 1971 and the implications of such a planned move for the themes above.||Farhana Ibrahim

The finance minister is wrong to declare standard deduction, which is a mandatory deduction to arrive at the 'net taxable income' of the salaried class, as some kind of a 'personal allowance' which should be done away with. It is neither a 'personal allowance' nor an 'exemption'. And if it is a mandatory mechanism for computing the 'net taxable income' of the salaried class, can this be ever abolished as a category? It is indeed ironical that while P Chidambaram wants to dispense with standard deduction, treating it as a 'personal allowance', he has no problem in perpetuating exemptions for several allowances such as on transport, uniforms and for encouraging academic research and other professional pursuits.||Ramesh Dadhich,C.

At issue was indigeneity, the politics of place and belonging in the Indian nation. The affiliation with Hindu nationalism marked a radical departure from the previous decade's politics when adivasis had asserted a separate tribal identity and sought to reclaim rights to resources. These claims, elaborated eloquently during the course of the anti-dam movement, were shaped and strengthened by globally circulating discourses about indigenous peoples. How did these discourses, and the distinctive meanings of adivasi indigeneity to which they lent themselves, come to be superseded? Instead of signifying a subaltern experience of adivasi dispossession and resistance, how are discourses of indigeneity deployed to support the claims of the Hindu Right, to disenfranchise religious minorities and legitimise a politics of hate? How do Bhilala adivasis participate in this transformation in the valences of indigeneity? This paper traces adivasi mobilisation across three sites: rights to place and natural resources, religious reform, and electoral representation, to examine how discourses of indigeneity are differently constructed and contested across the terrain of class, caste and citizenship.||Amita Baviskar

The technique of Gonzalez-Rivera and Helfand (2001) is used to identify common factors across various markets. It is found that wholesale rice markets are considerably fragmented. A major reason for this is the excessive interference in rice markets by government agencies and barriers to internal trade. As a result it is hard for scarcity conditions in isolated markets to be picked up by markets with abundance in supply. A number of policy implications are also considered.||Raghbendra Jha,K. V.

In response to this, the corporate financing pattern shifted towards greater equity financing. However, contrary to expectations, this has not had the desired impact on investment (capital formation), thereby undermining the efficiency of the financial system.

However, to ensure the humane treatment of prisoners in custody, the apex court has simply to adopt an earlier ruling of 1982 that had allowed access to convicted prisoners in jail so that society at large would be apprised of the reasons behind their detention and the conditions in which they served their sentence.||A.

This paper provides a critical overview of recent global debates on electricity restructuring. The paper first discusses the electricity price trajectories in countries that are often cited as models of reform. It then discusses several challenges to creating competitive markets in electricity. The final two sections relate international experience to the Indian context. The authors find that the full model of organised electricity markets will be extremely challenging to implement in India, and suggest a more pragmatic "no-regrets" approach. Suitably designed, competition may be one element in this approach but it is not a short cut to larger reforms.||Navroz K. Dubash,Daljit Singh

This implies that activities that once formed part and parcel of household labour activity (performed by women - even if under the control of men) also become commercialised. Food security depends not only on the market, but also on the social and political structures within which markets are situated. One of these social structures is gender. Two aspects of this gendered process are explored in this essay, the first being 'productive deprivation'. Using field evidence from south Asia, the impact of technological change is shown to be strongly net labour displacing and strongly biased against female labour. At the same time, poverty ensures the persistence of petty commodity production, where women are either self-employed or 'unwaged' family workers. As seen in the case of rice production in West Bengal, growth in production has been accompanied by the displacement of women from the rice mill labour forces in which economies of scale have been pitched against unwaged work in petty production.||Barbara Harriss-White

The result is that while savers now earn interest only a little higher than the inflation rate, for most borrowers the costs of bank finance remain stubbornly high. Competition has not led to any reasonableness in banks' behaviour in setting rates of interest on deposits and loans. The situation calls for greater intervention by the central bank, which apart from moral suasion, needs to prescribe a definitive spread over the prime lending rate.||EPW Research Foundation

But an archival reading of their accounts, as attempted by this paper, reveals that these failure stories belonged to those who eked out a living as small-time traders and petty shopkeepers. Obligations to their tight-knit communities, family responsibilities and the absence of wider assistance networks often drove them to bankruptcy; others succumbed in the initial risk period of an enterprise's existence. The success stories, in contrast, were those who were able to circumvent these risks.||Gijsbert Oonk

This paper examines this by now 'common wisdom' in the light of contemporary demographic reality in India. Based on extensive research in a western Uttar Pradesh district, it argues that the scale of Hindu-Muslim demographic differences has been exaggerated, and that the explanations provided for these differences are equally pernicious. Instead, it attempts an understanding of these 'causes' leading to differences in fertility through an analysis of the kind of governmentality seen in post-independence India and argues for new policy initiatives that avoid the punitive victim-blaming approach that has thus far been the norm.||Roger Jeffery,Patricia Jeffery

It concentrates on the initiatives pursued by the company in order to build a workforce and forge labour policies tailored more closely to the imperatives of competition, and evaluates how far these objectives were achieved. For, in the management's own words, ITI needed to evolve from being a 'production agency of DoT' to a 'business company' - an evolution which called for it to embrace new strategic options as well as new ways of doing things, if it was to stand a chance of survival in the changed business environment. In the field of labour relations, these revised priorities would take two main directions: the implementation of a voluntary retirement scheme (VRS), and the tightening of disciplinary controls together with cutbacks in welfare benefits.||Dilip Subramanian

However, open access is subject to a cross-subsidy surcharge to compensate the incumbent distribution licensee for loss of cross-subsidy. Similarly, new distribution licensees may be required to have a mix of cross-subsidising and subsidised consumers to prevent 'cream skimming'. These restrictions will reduce the competitive impact of these provisions since cross-subsidy is likely to be difficult to reduce, especially for agriculture and rural consumers. Two steps are, therefore, necessary for introducing competition in the power sector. First, there should be a physical and organisational separation of agriculture and rural supply. Second, cross-subsidy in tariffs should be eliminated for urban domestic consumers and replaced with 'lifeline' rates for low income consumers and subsidised extension of the network to high cost areas. As in the case of telecommunications this may be funded through a sector specific 'universal charge'.||Sidharth Sinha

But identity definition for the tribals in the early post-independent years has been largely a process from without. While the state made efforts to draw tribals into the national sphere, other elements, chiefly right wing groups, advocated measures that would restore to the tribals their ancient heritage. It is in more recent times, with the advent of education and the threat posed to tribal ways of living by other dominant groups and demands imposed by development, that tribal identity articulation has been a process directed from within the tribal community, spearheaded by a growing middle class. Such articulation has not merely been in the form of demands for some degree of political autonomy but has also seen initiatives to ensure the protection and development of tribal language, customs and culture.||Virginius Xaxa

This paper contributes to the debate by showing how market forces may motivate banks to select high capital adequacy ratios as a means of lowering their borrowing costs. If the effect of competition among banks is strong, then it may overcome the tendency for bank under-capitalisation that arises from systemic effects. If systemic effects are strong, regulation is required. An empirical test for Indian public sector banks during the 1990s demonstrates that better capitalised banks experienced lower borrowing costs. These findings suggest that ongoing reform efforts at the international level should primarily focus on increasing transparency and strengthening competition among banks.||Saibal Ghosh,Abhiman Das

It is argued that large structural primary deficits and interest payments relative to GDP have had an adverse effect on growth in recent years. There is a clear need to bring down the combined debt-GDP ratio from its current level, which is in excess of 80 per cent of GDP. The process of adjustment can be considered in two phases: adjustment and stabilisation. In the adjustment phase, the fiscal deficit should be reduced in each successive year until the revenue deficit, and correspondingly, government dissaving, is eliminated. In the second phase, the fiscal deficit could be stabilised at 6 per cent of GDP and the debt-GDP ratio would eventually stabilise at 56 per cent.||C. Rangarajan,D. K. Srivastava

However, the major weakness of the strategy consists of not dovetailing demand management policies in a developmental programme; ignoring the saving-generating impact of investment in an economy where rural and informal sectors are characterised by considerable underutilisation of resources even while the formal sector may not have much slack; treating education, health and other social sector expenditures as current; and absence of optimality considerations in respect of allocation of expenditures and of alternative modes of their financing, taking into account their short- and longer-term effects on growth, equity and government finances.||Mihir Rakshit

But the family is not a purely ideological construction and has a material basis in the need that all human beings have for personal care. Evidence suggests that blood and marriage alone cannot bind families and communities together; some other cement such as the acceptance of gendered, hierarchical relationships or love and solidarity is required. There is no doubt we have to get rid of this family, but what is the alternative?||Rohini Hensman

In India, the STT was introduced for the first time by the government in the union budget for 2004-05. However, the revenue potential of the revised STT is limited and if the revenue loss on account of the reduction in capital gains tax is deducted, it is even lower. There is scope to rationalise the STT in India. The short-term capital gains tax on securities can be abolished altogether. A uniform STT, of 0.05 per cent each on buyers and sellers of all equity transactions, together with a 0.01 per cent STT on derivative sales is likely to yield higher gross (net) revenues.||B. K.

While ensuring the accessibility of such services does not constitute the sole panacea for economic growth, there are definite causal links between ensuring such increased access, growth and poverty reduction. To make real progress on this front, India needs to redraft its current approach to providing financial services. Steps that are tailored to meet local needs for finance need to be worked out by drawing on past experiences and studying those adopted by other countries. However, three steps are vital as preliminary requirements, (i) increased sophistication in bank regulation, (ii) development of basic financial services infrastructure, and (iii) an adaptive regulatory framework.||Nachiket Mor

In the country as a whole the share of the working age group (15-59) in the population has been increasing. The window will be open till 2035 and after that the relative share of the working age group in the population will start declining. The current bulge in labour supply in India cannot be attributed merely to the high population growth rates that prevail in some backward Indian states, but is also due to the change in age structure in favour of the more productive age groups in the relatively developed states. The latter phenomenon can be attributed to the steadily declining fertility rates in these states. However, the paper emphasises that such demographic changes are not sufficient to provide an upward push to rates of economic growth, but should be accompanied by generation of employment opportunities and human capital formation.||Siddhartha Mitra,R.

One, the programme was initially very successful because it enjoyed a commitment widely shared across the political spectrum. Second, it needs strong departmental inputs in terms of planning, budgeting and technical supervision, should involve local governments and be responsive to the needs of the poorest. It may be difficult to replicate the same political commitment in the India of 2005. Yet, the case for an employment guarantee remains strong because it is unacceptable that despite the country approaching middle-income status there are 250-300 million people desperate for work and better livelihood.||Aruna Bagchee

Analysis of data from the second National Family Health Survey shows that differences in fertility, especially between Hindus and Muslims, are not explained by differences in socio-economic characteristics, as argued by many observers. This is true of differentials in contraceptive practice as well. However, the differences appear to be a passing phase in the process of fertility transition. Since all religious communities in India have experienced substantial fertility declines and contraceptive practice has been well accepted, it is expected that fertility levels among communities would converge over time.||P.

Afterthoughts on the Secular-Communal Question||A theory of secularism in the sense of a theory about possessing the concept 'secular' is quite distinct from a theory about how the concept secular represents. Much of the debate on the secular-communal question has emphasised the latter aspect. This article argues, however, that the treatment of the secular-communal question is not only one of separating religion from politics, but one that must be orientated towards the place of secularism. The secular-communal debate essentially ignores issues of ethical particularism, or the intranslability of concepts (i e, secularism) as well as the kinds of necessity that bind previous (or parallel) instances of a concept with a new one; hence the long-standing debate must also articulate an alternative for secularism.||Sasheej Hegde

For the purpose of the study, the data have been taken from primary as well as secondary sources.

Such reform, argued its proponents, would improve the productivity of the electricity industries and attract much needed private investment. A review of these reform experiences suggests that there is a significant disparity between the expected and actual outcomes of reform. Explanations for this disparity appear to be narrow, industry-centric and ideological. This is unhelpful as it obscures the real challenges confronting the electricity industries and precludes consideration of meaningful policy prescriptions. There is a need to develop a broader perspective on electricity reform. This paper is an attempt in that direction.||Deepak Sharma

Obviously wasteful expenditure is a bad thing. State governments must reduce the slack in resource mobilisation and expenditure. This however is not the fundamental problem for Madhya Pradesh today. The problem is that MP has too little public investment and a low growth of state income, etc. There is little merit in the argument in favour of a smaller or zero fiscal deficit, if the spending is aimed towards increasing state income and employment.||Smita Gupta

In India, policies have focused largely on medical services. Public health services, and even implementation of basic public health regulations, have been neglected. Various organisational issues also militate against the rational deployment of personnel and funds for disease control. There is strong capacity for dealing with outbreaks when they occur, but not to prevent them from occurring. Impressive capacity also exists for conducting intensive campaigns, but not for sustaining these gains on a continuing basis afterwards. This is illustrated by the near-eradication of malaria through highly-organised efforts in the 1950s, and its resurgence when attention shifted to other priorities such as family planning. This paper reviews the fundamental obstacles to effective disease control in India, which need to be dealt with on an urgent basis.||Monica Das Gupta

However a close analysis indicates that there is little justification for a hike in interest rates. Public policies ought to lead market expectations rather than being driven by them. What is required, at the same time, is that pressure be brought to bear on banks to end the unhealthy practice of lending below the prime lending rate to large corporates. The RBI governor has observed that there is underpricing of risk in corporate lending and there could be overpricing in lending to small borrowers and agriculture. This inequity in lending is unhealthy for the development process; a policy directive is called for that directs banks to lend only to small borrowers at sub-PLR rates and keep the spread beyond PLR to within 3 to 4 percentage points.||EPW Research Foundation

There appears an equal decline in the ability of existing structures of representation to provide poorer social groups influence over policy. On the other hand, there is also evidence of a crisis in popular representation in several low- and middle-income countries. Poorer social groups appear to have a limited capacity to present a reform agenda that addresses issues of basic rights and ensures livelihoods. To test this hypothesis, this paper studies sample communities in Delhi, representative of a broad cross section of the population. Through an analysis of the data collected, the study describes and explains patterns of political participation, focusing in particular on ways in which poorer social groups organise, obtain political representation and try to solve collective social problems. It appears, contrary to most expectations, that the needs and interest of poorer people are increasingly being met through the 'new politics' of social movements, the poor in particular still seek to represent themselves and to tackle their problems through political parties.||John Harriss

During this period, the Sensex experienced the worst single-day decline in its history. In the three months between April and June 2004, the index declined by about 17 per cent. And it all started because of the selling pressure exerted by the FIIs after the elections when they became less confident about the continuation of the reform process in India. FII control in the companies that constitute the Sensex is very high. Data on the shareholding pattern show that the FIIs are currently the most dominant non-promoter shareholder in most of the Sensex companies and they also control more tradable shares of these companies than any other investor group.||Parthapratim Pal

The search for a new political language begins in this paper with two sets of descriptions of animal sacrifice from the past - one by the Tamil Saivites, who were at the forefront of campaigning against animal sacrifices in temples during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and the other by the Madras legislative assembly in 1950, when it debated a bill to abolish animal and bird sacrifices in temple precincts.||M.

What is of concern here is that the current perspectives focusing on violence and victimhood are not able to capture these strategic battles of women. The seemingly "natural" response of looking to law for resolutions is a problematic move - one that individualises the woman into a case and leads to a depoliticisation of the discussion of women's battles in the family.||A.

The time, however, has come to critically evaluate the discipline, especially the research that emanates from women studies centres. This article argues for research in the subject to be imbued with more vigour. This implies a greater self-awareness but also an understanding of the past and of earlier endeavours and interventions. Methodologies selected and methods adopted for study must be critically selected to suit the context of study. Moreover, research findings should ostensibly seek to benefit the subject as well. If findings are widely collated, it could also help foster and develop a better understanding of the subject.||Maithreyi Krishnaraj

The methodology of budget analysis uses hard quantitative data accessed from government sources; its analyses, using universally accepted and respected research techniques, lend the initiative a high degree of credibility with the state, thereby strengthening its potential to influence policy. Despite its importance, budget work has not been able to transcend the boundaries of professional development organisations to form alliances and networks necessary to provide the cutting edge to social action groups, media and other civil society actors.||Yamini Aiyar,Amitabh Behar

Money Market Mutual Funds make it possible for retail investors to participate in money markets. Despite the advantages, various constraints have impeded the potential of MMMFs. A lack of long-term vision on part of the mutual fund industry has resulted in low levels of retail penetration.

While definitions of 'freedom' and 'self-determination' may differ, and there is at present a plethora of Naga representative bodies, there is nevertheless broad agreement among Nagas, like with other movements in the north-east, of the hegemonic power of the Indian state. Governments at the centre have, by turns, adopted a policy of militarisation and of extending grants to a small section of the local elite that it has co-opted in the task of governance. Any resolution of conflicts in the north-east, including the Naga one, could begin when both sides negotiate from a position of equals, and by an end to the process of militarisation that has tended to largely view dissent as a sign of subversion and anti-nationalism.||Dolly Kikon

Despite the ills that have accompanied this process of urbanisation, the world, as this article argues, appears to have coped relatively well with the large-scale increase in urban population of recent years; it is equally possible for urbanising economies in Asia to replicate the experience of developed economies. For this to happen, it is essential that all aspects of city management, including the fostering of a professionalised workforce, are strengthened. This, in turn, would increase the creditworthiness of city governments and help attract the investment necessary for vital urban infrastructure projects. In an increasingly interconnected world, decentralised governance would ideally assist the practice of prudent macroeconomic and trade policies essential for ensuring a continuous access to international capital markets.||Rakesh Mohan,Shubhagato Dasgupta

In this regard, education of the whole population is essential. Although the transformation of a country from a high level of illiteracy to one of near universal literacy cannot be achieved overnight, the fact remains that the status of a child going to school contrasts sharply with that of a full-time worker, even in a situation of low literacy levels. The school going child is treated primarily as a student and any work performed by him/her cannot be at the expense of his/her school activities. In other words, it is accepted that the primary activity of the child is that of a student and not a worker. Therefore, any programme to increase literacy levels among children must necessarily also be a programme to reduce the incidence of child labour. The two objectives are contingent on each other.||Shantha Sinha

This study provides evidence, based on estimated nutrient prices and a 'balanced diet', that shows how far the official poverty lines have fallen out of line with their 'true' measure. The paper provides robust evidence, with special reference to the socially disadvantaged groups, that suggests that the poverty situation in India is much worse than that revealed in official poverty statistics ('adjusted' or not). This paper makes a methodological contribution by proposing an expenditure-based poverty line, using the household specific estimated nutrient prices, that serves as a compromise between the official poverty line and that specified directly in terms of calories. The proposed poverty line has the advantage of incorporating inter household variation in food preferences due to regional, class, caste and other non-demographic factors that the 'official poverty line' does not do. The study confirms the inferior poverty status, on both poverty measures, of the socially disadvantaged groups vis-Ã -vis the others. This paper, also, contains evidence that points to the usefulness of the public distribution system in the anti-poverty programme for the backward classes.||Ranjan Ray,Geoffrey Lancaster

Pushing the state governments to the market on such a sizeable scale for their plan finances may in the first place prevent them from mobilising the required resources, and, secondly, whatever they do mobilise may have to be done at higher interest cost.

This paper employs the sectoral system of innovation framework for understanding the differential outcomes in innovation capability building in the industry achieved by China and India. The two countries have pursued widely diverging strategies for developing their domestic innovation capability. India followed a very rigid policy of indigenous development of domestic technologies by establishing a stand-alone public laboratory that developed state-of-the-art switching technologies. The public laboratory was not given any strategic direction, even though it was technologically speaking, very competent. Consequently, the country, despite possessing good quality human resources was unable to keep pace with changes in the technology frontier and the equipment industry has now become essentially dominated by affiliates of MNCs. China, on the contrary, first depended on MNCs for her technology needs in this area. But subsequently encouraged the emergence of three national champions, two of which are erstwhile public laboratories. The country has built up considerable hardware capability in both fixed line and mobile communications technology and has also emerged as a major player in world markets.||Sunil Mani

So policies that promote similar access in India will enable more professionals to become first generation entrepreneurs. State governments that implement such policies will find the financial burden to be small. While driven by their desire for wealth and growth, many of the new capitalists are likely to back positive changes in areas like education.||Ignatius Chithelen,Val Souza

While credit under the Swarnjayanti Gram Swarozgar Yojna scheme across states has been extended in proportion to the poor in the population, this is not so in the case of self help group (SHG) credit that has been growing at the rate of 120 per cent per annum. However, growth in SHG credit has been uneven. The southern states are seen as SHG-developed states while Bihar and Madhya Pradesh are among those characterised as SHG-backward. But besides the SHG model in extending credit to weaker sections, other different models exist for extending microcredit to the poor and weaker sections.||Rajaram Dasgupta

It would be a great mistake to take reform to be some means-centred, goal-independent institutional requirement that 'must be' pursued without aksing any questions about how that institutional demand would influence the lives of the people that are involved. There may or may not be any payment-free lunch, but it would certainly be extremely odd to pursue ethics-free reform. If one were to be asked what three factors would be most important in the task of initiating and implementing a major reform, the factors to be emphasised would be three R's: reach, range, and reason. The reach of the results to be achieved, the range of the ways and means to be used, and the reason for choosing the priorities we pursue.||Amartya Sen

The obstacles to women's equal participation in governance in these countries are embedded in socio-cultural patterns of living and the intensely competitive nature of politics. This article examines various women empowerment initiatives like community management, local governance and reservations. It also analyses the representation of women in parliaments of these countries and suggests that what is needed is not a retreat from demanding quotas, but a consideration of the most useful forms of such reservations. Along with this, women's representation in the bureaucracy and in the structures of political parties also has to be increased.||Gail Omvedt

We formulate a model where agents face shocks to their income and utility due to ailments and share such risks through a bargaining process. The predictions of the model are tested using data generated from the 52nd round of National Sample Survey. We find that except for some scheduled tribe households and three out of 77 regions in India, villagers seem to be insured against health shocks. The results are robust to regional heterogeneity and data truncation on the basis of caste and occupation. We do not, however, find risk sharing to be complete. Hence, it may be that health is partially self-insured.||Jyoti Mudgal,Subrata Sarkar,Tridib Sharma

Thus blame for incitement could lie in the persistent hate campaign waged by right wing organisations. The degree of capacity and autonomy vested in a state government also determines its capability to resist a riot situation. Further the degree of communal amity also depends on the bonds of civic engagement and associational activity that exist between communities. While causative factors could differ, it is clear that compulsions of electoral politics and the increasing anonymity and disparity of urban life are playing a greater role in communal conflagrations in post-independent India.||Roshni Sengupta

The elected representatives have repeatedly refused to grab the opportunities to escape from the Power Purchase Agreement, possibly in order to avoid an open scrutiny of the deal.

It uses data from the National Family Health Survey carried out in 1998-99 and employs multivariate and multilevel regression models in data analysis. Results show that Muslim-Hindu differences in the desire for additional children and use of contraceptives are pervasive across India and almost invariant across states and districts. This is consistent with the findings from our analysis of data from the first NFHS in 1992-93. However, Muslim-Hindu differences have narrowed between 1992-93 and 1998-99. It is thus argued that Muslim-Hindu fertility behaviour seems to be moving towards convergence. The pervasiveness of Muslim-Hindu differences in reproductive behaviour calls for complementary 'global explanations'.||A. Dharmalingam,K. Navaneetham,S. Philip Morgan

This paper looks at how the memory of Morichjhanpi was evoked by the islanders to reveal their resentment about the unequal distribution of resources between them and the Royal Bengal tigers of the Sundarbans reserve forest. The government's primacy on ecology and its use of force in Morichjhanpi was seen by the Sundarbans islanders as a betrayal not only of refugees and of the poor and marginalised in general, but also of Bengali backward caste identity. At the same time, the reasons leading to the Morichjhanpi massacre have to be understood in relation to the long history which led to the partition of Bengal and the intricacies of caste, class and communal differences.||Annu Jalais

The quantum of relief is substantial and the conditionalities - passage of a fiscal responsibility legislation and reduction of revenue deficits - are not unreasonable. However, single-minded pursuit of fiscal correction to get the benefit of debt relief can have disastrous implications for states where social and economic infrastructure investments have been insufficient. Some of them will have to impose heavy cuts on development expenditure to adhere to the tight schedule to bring down the revenue deficit to zero by 2008-09. A more rational approach may have been to allow them to follow more realistic adjustment paths over a longer period.||N. J. Kurian

The supporters of reform and their critics take extreme positions on issues that are sufficiently important for us to engage our respective intelligent opposition in serious conversation. The Left claims the reforms are "anti-people", when in essence it is defending the interests of the small strata of the salaried. The supporters of reforms, on their part, offer less than reasoned arguments in support of privatisation and labour reform, and work themselves into a frenzy about wastage in anti-poverty programmes. Discussion on reform is preoccupied with issues of trade and fiscal policy and financial markets. Reform would have been more popular if it were equally concerned about the appalling governance structure in the delivery of basic social services for the poor.||Pranab Bardhan

It finds that China's industrial growth rate is close to one and half times that of India's over the entire period, with the gap widening gradually. But Indian growth has been more stable. China's superior performance seems understandable in terms of its faster agricultural and exports growth. Does it mean there is little prospect of India catching up with China in the foreseeable future? China seems to suffer from huge excess capacity, misallocation of resources and a gross wastage of capital - as evident from the persistently high capital-output ratio. China's impressive industrial edifice seems to be built on somewhat shaky microeconomic and institutional foundations. In comparison, India's relatively strong foundations and domestic entrepreneurial capital seem to have the potential to improve performance, with a sounder macroeconomic environment: a step up in fixed investment to augment infrastructure supply and agricultural productivity, revival of long-term finance to boost industrialisation, and easier credit delivery to small and medium enterprises.||R.

Unlike other developed countries, which have adopted the route of providing higher intellectual property rights (IPRs) protection to promote the growth of the domestic pharmaceutical industry, Canada chose to limit IPRs on important pharmaceutical products. Till the early 1990s, Canada stood alone among the developed countries in using CLs for pharmaceutical patents held in Canada, which helped the promotion of the domestic generic industry. Interestingly, though the pharmaceutical industry of both countries has common points of comparison, the most important point of divergence is that while the Indian pharmaceutical industry is backed by a well-established homegrown chemical industry, Canada lacks this advantage.||N.

The merchant sector has suffered a financial crisis, hurting competition in both wholesale and retail markets. Advocates for deregulation assert that minor changes to market rules and regulations will yield the benefits promised. We argue that things are not so simple.

In fact, GM technology as a solution to the problems generated by the green revolution technological paradigm sustains and reinforces the hegemony of global and local elites.

Politically, inclusion has functioned through a claim on fiscal resources for the so-called 'intermediate' classes. In principle, these 'intermediate' groups could have generated economic activity and employment for the larger number of poor to whom direct assistance was unmanageable. In practice, the amorphous intermediate groups have displayed limited leadership, with the important recent exception of the surge in information technology activity. Bold policy initiatives have been constrained because the aspirations to acquire the symbols associated with the intermediate groups have dominated. Major policy changes in India's political context are, therefore, possible only with strong new leadership in politically tranquil periods or under the duress of a crisis. To foster faster growth - while also breaking up the social hierarchies that persist in limiting inclusion - four long-standing challenges remain: undertaking effective decentralisation, raising educational attainments, placing limits on access to fiscal resources through binding fiscal rules, and achieving further discipline through external competition.||Ashoka Mody

The state should be liable to dismissal under Article 356 if the rioting continues for, say, more than five days resulting in the loss of more than, say, 100 lives. There is also a strong case for a separate law on the protection and compensation for victims of crime and violence.||Iqbal A. Ansari

Studies making visible the centrality of women's agency in peace building and the need to have women participate at the peace table are ignored by the dominant conflict, peace and security discourses. This paper maps the complex and variegated picture of civilian and militarised women's agency in moments of violent social transformation and the peculiarities of their languages of resistance and empowerment.||Rita Manchanda

The resistance against the colonial order and the zamindars soon transformed itself into a broad-based struggle for a homeland, a demand that figured in similar protest movements during the colonial period. These movements were largely unsuccessful, yet their legacy lives on. This is because natural resource management in the post-colonial period is still marked by some continuity with an earlier period. This is especially true with regard to the centralised framework of forest management introduced by the British, which still remains in place.||Sanjeeva Kumar

We find that a market friendly investment climate is important for achieving higher levels of productivity. This conclusion is robust, unaffected by the choice of the investment climate indicator. A market friendly investment climate, however, does not mean that the regulatory function of the government should be done away with. Government regulation is crucial to address market failures and to protect social interests, but the policies and practices of the governments should be transparent and designed without distorting the incentives of the firms to invest and grow.||C.

Since its introduction, the acreage under approved Bt cotton in India has increased substantially from 90,000 acres in 2002 to 1.3 million acres in 2004. This study, with the help of a primary survey, explores the paradoxes reported in earlier studies on Indian experience and finds that the technology generates overall economic benefits on average, but heterogeneity among farmers needs to be accounted for. The study also finds that germplasm effects can play an important role.||Gopal Naik,Matin Qaim,Arjunan Subramanian,David Zilberman

Frequent floods every year in Assam have been destroying standing crops, creating waterlogging, soil erosion and affecting large crop areas and thus threatening the sustainability of the drive towards higher productivity and production of various crops in the state. While most flood control measures undertaken so far have been of a short-term nature, concerted policy decisions on long-term measures, both on the part of state and central governments, and cooperation by neighbouring countries are needed to solve flood problems permanently.||Phanindra Goyari

Over the last few years, due to a variety of factors, particularly falling load factors and competition from the private sector, MSRTC's financial performance has shown a marked deterioration. After the financial turnaround of Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation when it was split into four smaller organisations, it has shown a marked improvement in physical and financial performance. The same solution is suggested by many for large corporations like MSRTC. In this paper, we examine whether splitting of MSRTC into smaller regions would actually help in its financial recovery.

Those who have argued for a narrow definition have been motivated in part by the desire to reduce the size of the problem and thus make it more manageable. But this conceptual sleight of hand flies in the face of common sense and results in making the work of millions of children invisible to public policy and public action. This paper argues that the distinction at the conceptual level between child labour and child work is essentially flawed. It revisits some of the empirical questions around this distinction and concludes that such a distinction be abandoned both at the level of theory and practice.||Neera Burra

It appears that profits after tax, investment opportunities, availability of external funds, cost of borrowings and cost of equity are the important determinants of the savings of the private corporate sector in India. This paper analyses the trends in private corporate savings in India during this period, and uses dynamic panel data for empirically identifying the factors which influence corporate savings decisions.

In an innovation justified to fill this void, the Bangalore Agenda Task Force introduced its version of the Public-Private-Partnership as one such model for private sector participation in urban governance. However, PPPs must be evaluated in the broader context of urban politics and planning. And as this case study shows, it is critical to follow the trajectory of private sector involvement into the broader arenas of policy-making. Although the BATF did not include interventions for the majority of the population - the poor - its activities have played a critical role in developing the urban reform programmes at the state and national levels. The policies proposed by the BATF members based on their experiences in Bangalore require much greater analysis and debate, rather than simply riding on the merits of their alleged success.||Asha Ghosh

These changes were set in motion from the 1950s, following an incomplete land reform programme that ostensibly favoured the middle landlord class. Increasing poverty, poor returns from land and rising rent demands have since then widened the ranks of the poor peasantry which now consist of a mix of several castes. It is again from these sections that most migration to urban areas, chiefly as unskilled or low-skilled labour, takes place. On the other hand, middle castes chiefly drawn from upper backward castes increasingly make up the landlord class. It is these caste groups that have been able to perpetuate their dominance by also making up and aligning with the dominant political classes. On their part, the radical Left organisations that have made headway in several areas of south and north Bihar have been unable to mobilise rising peasant class consciousness in rural areas, due to their inability to fully comprehend the dichotomy that defines caste and class in the state.||Alakh N.

This can easily lead to a superficial and misleading understanding of the nature and causes, as well as the cures of human poverty. The grave danger posed by the income-poverty line approach is that it inevitably leads to a misidentification of the poor, and subsequently to the adoption of targeting, monitoring and evaluation criteria which are equally narrow, thus carrying the many blind spots in the concept of deprivation into the operational phase of interventions.||Ashwani Saith

In the works of history written by colonial powers, the word, 'colony', did not figure. Also most works by colonial historians downplay landmark events. At the same time, readers remain unaware of the epochal events of 1858, when by a parliamentary enactment Britain created an all-powerful secretary of state, independent of the British Parliament, governing India in the name of the queen. This Act made the entire Indian top executive subordinate to the 'home government'. The new dispensation under the secretary of state, based in London, also decided on most matters pertaining to India. It is time scholars begin to think more on the period between August 2, 1858 when this Act came into force and August 15, 1947, when the country became independent.||Arun Banerji

In more recent decades, however, the intrepid and often epic struggles of project affected people have not only succeeded in raising grave doubts about the net public benefits of mega dams, they have also led to an incremental, even if grudging and still highly inadequate acknowledgement under public policy and law, of the rights of the affected peoples. But as implementation of these projects bears out, even these few and hard won rights have been substantially denied in practice by state administrations. This article will illustrate this by examining the role of government officials and state agencies and the experience of displacement in Madhya Pradesh's Indira Sagar Pariyojana.||Harsh Mander

By comparing irrigation institutions under different property rights, the study identifies the significant factors that contribute to the success and sustainability of irrigation institutions. It is found that albeit the physical characteristics of irrigation systems and the heterogeneities of the members of the user groups do have an impact on the outcome, it is the institutional environment as reflected in the presence of clear as well as flexible systems of rules and regulations, enforcement mechanisms, nesting and networking of such institutions, etc, that have become the most crucial determinants.||Vineetha Menon,Antonyto Paul,K.

Thus, over 1.5 per cent of GDP is being diverted into this unproductive holding of assets, at a time when the economy's domestic saving and investment rates have remained effectively stuck at around 23 to 34 per cent of GDP. It should be possible to restrain gold imports, with a combination of policies that is consistent with an environment of policy reforms. A sizeable increase in import duty and imposition of wealth tax seem to be the obvious candidates. The weaning away of people from gold to financial assets, while it is the answer in the long run, can only be a gradual process. A healthy capital market with vigorous regulations curbing unhealthy practices may go a long way.||EPW Research Foundation

The reduction of duties will be accompanied by a real depreciation of the rupee relative to the exchange rate in the base line scenario (of no tariff reductions). This will substantially offset the direct effect of tariff reduction on industrial goods. The easy availability of inputs at low tariff rates and the pressure to improve productivity should take care of the remaining gap. No significant industrial product line is likely to go out of business, though intra-industry trade will increase even more rapidly.||Arvind Virmani

Carry-overs from the central planning era, these policies proceed on the basis that finances can be managed without reference to incentives, financial capacity of sub-national governments or fiscal discipline. Fiscal responsibility cannot be planned from above; rather rules and conditions must be created so that it will have to be practised by states. Subject to this condition, state autonomy should not be affected by the system of central transfers.||Raja J. Chelliah

The aim of this paper is, in the context of India, to examine the empirical robustness of certain propositions related to the ideas which have been addressed in the literature. The investigation indicates that empirical evidence in India is consistent with some important propositions in the literature: (i) regulation tends to create an incentive for regulated firms to increase their debt level, (ii) debt has a positive effect on the return on equity (ROE), and (iii) if a regulated firm's investment is relatively large, it is inclined to be highly leveraged.||Makoto Nagaishi

Like its predecessors, the TFC did not make any drastic changes in total statutory transfers and worked around tax devolution and grants so that the centre's outgo was not substantially increased and equalisation was broadly similar to the past. Although the forecast of revenues and non-plan revenue expenditure has been seasoned with some norms, the incentive structure of the main recommendations remains unaltered.

Formerly seen as evidence of chronic social and economic breakdown, internal migration is now seen as a major mechanism for the redistribution of resources from richer to poorer localities and a vital means of raising the incomes of the poor. The same revision of view is affecting international migration. Remittance flows have become major components in the foreign exchange earnings of a number of countries. After some reluctance, governments have come to embrace emigration for work, to facilitate and reinforce its effects on the alleviation of poverty. However, there are problems in the loss of the most enterprising and best-trained workers of developing countries. Can the interests at stake - developing countries, migrants, developed countries - be reconciled? Temporary circulatory migration for the purposes of training would seem to be the best outcome, so that migration becomes a means to enhance the human capital of developing countries for the task of reducing world poverty. There are, however, many options for developed countries without immigration - from the reform of their domestic labour markets to off-shoring. The real choice is about what sort of world we want.||Nigel Harris

This article focuses on the fiscal feasibility of a plan for global inequality reduction, a project that can be defined as a large-scale historic social process of social change aiming to diminish 'oligarchic wealth' in favour of a less extremely unbalanced structure of distribution, that is, 'democratic wealth'. The project proposes global collective action to reduce interstate inequality in per capita economic performance.

Sociological Perspectives||Medicine as a body of knowledge has incorporated dominant class, caste and other biases/prejudices and notions. Its view of the human system is contextualised in a hegemonic, patriarchal class society, interpreting and transforming information and insights acquired through scientific investigation into knowledge suitable to the social environment in which it was grounded. Medicine and its practice have influenced the construction of gender roles in society through biologically deterministic arguments. These notions have acquired credibility through their practice in medicine, citation in medical journals and training, and are especially reinforced through research. Textbooks and instructional materials impart values that students imbibe and in course of time integrate into clinical practice and research. This understanding forms a basis for reviewing textbooks in preventive and social medicine, a subdiscipline that aims to ground the understanding and management of disease and medical practice in a social context.||Padma Prakash

Poverty is endemic, especially for groups such as women and the lower castes that have been, by and large, excluded or are simply added on as afterthoughts to the development process. Poverty, empowerment and status, whether of gender or caste, are interrelated and also have a multi-dimensional nature. Policies and programmes to ensure "mainstreaming" must ensure equality, that is, empowerment and participation in decision-making processes. A first step, however, to monitor and ensure that such programmes and policies are indeed meeting the specified ends of poverty reduction and development, requires the adoption of indicators to measure disparities as well as to make such disparities visible.||Meena Acharya,Puspa Ghimire

This article examines the nature, experience and implications of such migration primarily to major urban centres for construction work. It goes on to suggest why those institutions mandated to protect vulnerable informal workers - labour departments, unions and the law - have largely failed to do so, and how in consequence adivasi migrants depend for their welfare upon agents, brokers and contractors who are also their most intimate exploiters. Finally, the article suggests how adivasi labour migrants might be supported and describes a recent initiative in this regard.||David Mosse,Sanjeev Gupta,Vidya Shah

The first is whether India needs nuclear energy for its development. A good case can be made that it does not. The second is whether the country needs nuclear weapons if it wants to live in peace with the world. Many believe, with good reason, that it does not. The answer to both questions that is offered by the deal is a future in which a nuclear-powered and nuclear-armed India swaggers along in the shadow of the US.

Contrary to official claims, the analysis finds that the policy has a substantial impact on the quantity and unit value of the investigated products.

The policy seems to be failing its objective and deserves reconsideration. Finally, this paper suggests a broadening of the horizon of the anti-dumping law, controlling the misuse of its ambiguities to provide undesirable protection to domestic industries and modifying the law to serve the larger interests of the economy.||Samir Kumar Singh

It aims to assess the progress made towards achieving the overall goals of DPEP, namely, providing access to primary education for out-of-school children and increasing the retention rate. It also assesses the extent to which gender disparities and differences between social groups such as scheduled castes and tribes and others have been reduced in respect of enrolment, dropout rates and learning achievement. In some instances, especially when outcomes across low and high literacy districts are studied, DPEP appears to have positively facilitated interventions in districts that started off with low female literacy rates. Also, interventions to facilitate access to schooling and to ensure social equity appear to have had an impact.||Shailendra Singh,Kala Seetharam Sridhar

Other kinds of knowledge, including science, are thus, simply considered as 'add-ons' to this core knowledge. What is absent is even an attempt to synthesise diverse knowledge strands.||Arshad Alam

At the current statutory wage rate, the scheme may help reduce rural poverty to 23 per cent (30 per cent year round), at a cost of 1.7 per cent of GDP. But, given the extra cost of the scheme, a greater impact on poverty would be achieved by taking the same fiscal outlay and allocating it equally to everyone, whether poor or not.||Rinku Murgai,Martin Ravallion

The Norwegian electricity market was subsequently integrated with the Swedish, Finnish and Danish markets to become the Nordic electricity market: the first common, integrated, intercountry electric power market in the world. The article discusses the background to electricity market reform, the analytical and legal foundations for reform and the chosen market and regulatory design. It finds that the market has performed well in terms of economic efficiency and market functionality, even when exposed to severe supply shocks because of water shortages for a power system that relies heavily on hydropower. However, it also identifies issues and challenges that must be addressed to improve the performance of the Nordic electricity market and its regulatory system.||Torstein Bye,Einar Hope

The reason for this is simple. The neo-liberal claim is based on the assumption that such 'opening up' would cause a substantial increase in the rate of productive investment in the economy. This claim, even if much direct foreign investment (DFI) were to flow in to the economy, is not necessarily valid, since such DFI inflow may well be of the sort that replaces domestic investment, and hence causes unemployment and a reduction in the level of activity ('de-industrialisation').||Prabhat Patnaik,Vikas Rawal

Land alienation, soil degradation, wild animal attacks, and declining access to forests have debilitated the livelihood base of this tribal community. Benefit cost analyses and stakeholder discussions reveal that millet-based dry farming with adoption of soil conservation or growing perennials on field bunds are economically efficient relative to current practices and enjoy stakeholder acceptance. Some other economically superior alternate land-uses are not acceptable locally, indicating the care with which tribal development policies need to be made.||Seema Purushothaman

An in-depth case analysis of 22 WUAs functioning in the Mahanadi Reservoir Project Complex is also presented. An institutional analysis framework was used to diagnose strengths and weaknesses of PIMS at macro and micro levels.

Its model boldly advocates balancing nature conservation imperatives with emancipatory politics, yet it does not appear to have carefully analysed the many state level factors that are perhaps responsible for the collapse of tiger protection mechanisms in the country. Instead, the task force expounds a predominantly Delhi-centric vision of top-down tiger policy-making and implementation. This was perhaps inevitable given the composition of the task force and its reliance on the ministry of environment for information and ideas.||K. Ullas Karanth

This paper is a follow-up to a 2001 baseline study of existing and historical R&D patterns and it revisits and updates the statistical series and reports on a second wave of R&D activity by Indian pharmaceutical firms. Taken as a whole, the various data sources examined in the paper point to a steady increase in pharmaceutical inventive activity in some areas of specific interest to developing countries. The set of diseases still in need of better low-cost treatments has seen a trend increase in its share of patenting and bibliometric citation. While overall investment in pharmaceutical R&D in India surged over the past five years, it became less targeted towards the health needs of the developing world.||Jean O. Lanjouw,Margaret MacLeod

Government provided health services only partially meet the needs of the rural and urban poor in the informal sector and making equitable and affordable medical care accessible to this segment remains a challenge. It is here that community-based health insurance (CBHI) schemes could provide viable alternatives. Four such CBHI schemes, that form the focus of this paper, are sustained by a pooling of resources as well as the regular "prepayment" of a small amount as premium, so as to enable poorer communities to meet high out-of-pocket medical expenses. While such schemes are still in their infancy, to ensure a wider coverage and acceptance, CBHI schemes could be attached to other decentralised agencies of governance such as panchayati raj institutions.||Akash Acharya,M.

Presumably, one can understand the IWT better if it is read in light of the internationally recognised customary rules on water sharing, including principles of equitable and reasonable utilisation, which are decisive in the absence of a bilateral water treaty. The State is not responsible for factual injury but only for legal injury in this field. The World Court applied the UN Convention on International Watercourses before its entry into force in order to resolve the dam dispute between Hungary and Slovakia. This is instructive for the Baglihar project dispute. Having a protocol to IWT is legally permissible, provided that the renegotiation of IWT for concluding a protocol is undertaken on a functional plan devoid of political aspects and strictly conforming to the IWT. This will help incorporate the contemporary principles of international watercourse law, including all customary principles in this field. This is crucial to balance the rights and duties of the riparian states and for the holistic and integrated water resources management of the Indus river system.||Muhammed Siyad A. C.

Even as marriage, sexuality, and motherhood appeared repeatedly at the heart of social reform, there are many unanswered questions about marriage and family structures of this period. The feminist critique of violence against women, post-independence, moved away from the embodied identity of victims to a critique of the state, and patriarchal and ideological structures. The difficult question here is to what extent the 'larger' picture of social and economic development was the focus of critique, at the expense of politicising familial relations.||Mary E. John

Not only were different regiments raised, with due consideration to caste, but favours and loyalties were liberally bestowed on willing Indians who helped with recruitment efforts. To placate the more aggressive nationalists, the British government also held out promises of reforms in government. At the same time, Indian political leaders, notably Tilak and Gandhi, were divided in their reactions to the imperial war efforts.||Aravind Ganachari

The article describes the power and cultural images of the global order and then tests the applicability of the two images by comparing their plausibility. The image of power is held by the realists who describe the international system as power determined or power laden, although individual scholars disagree on several dimensions of the international system. The debate between the defensive and aggressive realists is symptomatic of such disagreement and becomes the basis of the analysis here of the realism-inspired power image of the system.||Shibashis Chatterjee

As national and state level strategies unfold over the coming months, a vigorous and informed public discussion is needed to create a national consensus for dramatically increasing investments in health with concurrent improvements in accountability and management of the healthcare system. Equally important is induction of a cadre of village-based health activists, all women, who will link communities to an upgraded public health system. These women should emerge as the missionaries dedicated to advancing health in India. Money, medicines and medical facilities will be meaningless without these missionaries. Finally, flexibility, innovation, focus, inclusion and opennes must become essential features of the functioning of the National Rural Health Mission in its endeavour to provide good quality healthcare for all.||A.

New fields such as statistics came to be used to categorise and define subjects who were then placed in relation to each other in a fixed hierarchy. As this article argues, the tenor of the dominant anthropological discourse on the tribal showed only a marginal shift with the emergence of nationalism. In the early post-independent years, however, the question, that still continues to this day, of 'what to do with the tribal' was debated strongly between those (Ghurye and others) who advocated their 'assimilation' and the other side (chiefly Verrier Elwin) who argued for special protected spaces for the tribals.||R.

A large part of these FDI inflows is related to the success of China in having a 'guided financial market'. The benefits of these inflows, in the process, are reaped by both industry and finance, as opposed to a situation of finance-led growth alone, where speculation dominates the financial flows. In China, regulatory institutions in the area of banking, securities and insurance are given wide-ranging powers, thus keeping a close vigil on the functioning of both finance and industry.||Sunanda Sen

Nearly a quarter of the population of the state consists of members of the scheduled tribes, who have historically been one of the most disadvantaged sections of Indian society. In many respects, MP typifies the most difficult problems faced by the poorest regions of India. For this reason alone a study of MP's development trajectory would be instructive. An understanding of MP's development experience can also help us fathom some of the limitations of mainstream economic theory. With some creativity and imagination, it could enable formulation of new and effective strategies to tackle the most complex challenges of our time. This special edition of the EPW researches a few dimensions of the social, economic and political dynamics in the state.||Mihir Shah

It reports the results from an econometric investigation of the factors influencing the sex ratio at birth and among currently living children, by religion and by caste, for a sample of over 10,000 women. The investigation paid particular attention to religion and caste by subdividing the sample into Hindu, Muslim and dalit women who had all terminated their fertility. It enquired whether the effect of different variables on the sex ratio varied according to the religion and caste of the women. The econometric analysis found that a husband being literate served to raise the sex ratio - both at birth and of currently living children - but that the effect of husbands' literacy was stronger for Muslims and dalits than it was for Hindus. In other words, while the illiteracy of husbands exacerbated 'son preference' (and its obverse, 'daughter aversion'), the preference for sons (and the aversion to daughters) exercised a stronger hold on Hindu families than it did on Muslim and dalit families.||Vani K.

However, viewed from a long-term perspective, growth seems to have acquired an unwavering rate in the last two decades. This is an outcome of the weakening of inter-sectoral linkages, which impose constraints on sectoral growth in the short run and on overall growth eventually. There is a need to look 'inward' at the sectors and mutually reinforce their dependence to foster employment and output growth.||Suresh Babu M.
30/7/2005-05/8/2005||twelfth finance commission||4416962||Equity and Consistency Properties of TFC Recommendations||This paper examines three aspects of the Twelfth Finance Commission recommendations. First, it looks at the most urgent issue for states, the FRBM legislation which they must enact if they are to qualify for the interest rate reduction on debt owed to the centre. The required revenue deficit target of zero by 2008-09 is unambiguously clear but the fiscal deficit requirement is not. The parameter values underlying the fiscal deficit correction path could be valued by states very differently from those assigned in the TFC report. The second issue addressed in the paper is the complex and ambiguous set of conditionalities relating the debt write-offs in year t to the reduction in the revenue deficit in year (t-1) relative to (t-2). These conditionalities also carry a fiscal deficit cap which could be sharply inconsistent with a fiscal deficit correction path fully in conformity with that prescribed by the TFC. These issues are illustrated with simulations for a sample state. Finally, the paper examines the equity attributes of the tax devolution and non-tax grants prescribed by the TFC. The formula adopted for determining tax shares of states assigns a greater weightage to distribution-neutral factors, and so reverses the trend since the Sixth Finance Commission towards increasing weightage for redistributional factors. The non-tax grants do not show an inverse relationship with per capita GSDP. Together, these suggest that the TFC has chosen to move away from equity as a guiding principle for its statutory flows, but the report does not make plain why it has chosen to do so.||Indira Rajaraman,Debdatta Majumdar

In 2004, like 2003, the riots that took place started with small incidents, but they did not assume serious proportions as no political party tried to exploit them to engineer communal violence on a larger scale.

Governments which focus on growth as a means to address nutrition will require an extra generation to make substantial inroads compared to governments which successfully implement nutritional programmes. Thus, the commonly held belief that nutrition programmes are welfare interventions that use resources that could profitably be used to raise national incomes is a myth; investments in nutrition are among the most profitable available.||Harold Alderman

There was no increase in organised sector employment during the 1990s. The primary sector, particularly agriculture, has been stagnant or even declining. By contrast, the secondary and tertiary sectors have shown statistically significant and high rates of growth over the whole period. But the factory sector in Gujarat has undergone a higher degree of concentration than in the rest of India. More importantly, the capital-intensive nature of the growth in the factory sector has been even more pronounced in Gujarat. Looking at the sectoral growth rates, it seems that the economy of Gujarat grew in an unbalanced and volatile fashion over the period under consideration. There has been a significant transformation in occupational structure. But that transformation is out of step with the change in incomes derived from different sectors. A mismatch in the movement of income and employment shares is stronger in Gujarat than the rest of India. Further, the people living in rural Gujarat have become significantly proletarianised.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi,Panchanan Das,Sadhan Kumar Chattopadhyay

The events that led to a writ petition being heard in the Court were a subversion of constitutional conventions with fateful implications for democracy. But the solution did not lie in the Supreme Court directing the assembly to conduct its affairs in a manner mandated by the Court in breach of the principle of the constitutional separation of powers. The questionable and partisan action of the governor or speaker must be allowed to suffer a scrutiny by the general public and through the media rather than the Court embarking upon the misadventure of taking over the function of the house itself. This is nothing but usurpation of authority in breach of the principle of separation of powers.||Vijay Kumar

Based on the experience both from the west and other developing countries, there is no reason to believe that fertility transition will stall once the process sets in. Therefore, the scepticism about fertility transition among Indian Muslims is unwarranted. The paper also analyses the proximate determinants of fertility among Hindus and Muslims as against the socio-economic differentials as causes for the differences in reproductive behaviour.||K. S.

Already existing small local level institutions with their readily available support structure as seen in the case of the agricultural credit societies were ideally placed to serve as outlets for financial services to SHGs, given their numbers and reach. Despite these advantages, agricultural credit societies and cooperative banks have thus far played a limited role in the programme of linking SHGs to formal financial institutions. This paper examines the spread of the cooperative-SHG linkage across states, the relationship between commercial success of cooperative banks, the extent of the linkage established and the impact of such linkages on performance.||Malcolm Harper,Andreas Berkhof,R.

High prices for grains paid to producers, completely ignoring demand-side factors and costs involved in building and holding grain stocks have put them outside the reach of consumers.

Popular attention has, thus far, focused on the Pakistani army's action against the Bengalis, or on the India-Pakistan war. However, East Pakistan in 1971 was simultaneously a battleground for many different kinds of violent conflict that included militant rebellion, mob violence, military crackdown on a civilian population, urban terrorism to full-scale war between India and Pakistan. The culture of violence fomented by the conflict of 1971 forms the context for much of Bangladesh's subsequent history. A careful, evidence-based approach to understanding the events of 1971 is vital if the different parties to the conflict are to be ever reconciled.||Sarmila Bose

It is revealed that during 1983 to 1993-94, when agricultural output in West Bengal was growing at an unprecedented rate, the degree of inequality in the distribution of rural consumption expenditure declined significantly. However, during the later part of the 1990s, when the rate of growth of agricultural output declined substantially, its impact on rural income distribution was reversed, with deceleration in the rate of growth of rural employment and average earning of the agricultural labour households. Thus, income distribution in rural West Bengal favoured the poorer classes of population or marginal and small farmers during the period of impressive agricultural growth. But neither the impressive agricultural growth nor the favourable change in rural income distribution could be sustained in the following period.||Apurba Kumar Chattopadhyay

Analyses of the welfare state have pointed out the crucial role played by state policy in shaping the maintenance and reproduction choices of labour through social welfare programmes, income distribution policies, and substitute wage programmes. However, in developing countries where most of the labour falls outside the purview of state-mandated programmes, the crucial role of the family in maintaining and reproducing labour became evident in stark manner. Focusing on the actual processes of the social reproduction of labour, and the strategies of survival that engage them can yield a more nuanced understanding of the multiple dimensions of insecurity faced by contemporary labour in different historical contexts and the various strategies of protection they devise.||Rakhi Sehgal

The developing countries have refused to succumb so far. In agriculture, the reduced levels of total trade distorting subsidies proposed by the US and EU still remain quite high. Though developing countries made a big concession by yielding on line by line tariff cuts in the area of non-agricultural market access, developed countries are pushing for more concessions. In services, many developing countries do not want to give offers as their supply capacity is limited and the major difference is on the proposed "complementary" method of negotiations.||Bhagirath Lal Das

This paper reviews the role of capital flows into India and examines if such flows have in any way contributed to economic growth. The model developed by this paper suggests that capital inflows have not contributed towards either industrial production or economic growth. Either the amount of capital inflows has not been enough or the amounts flowing in have not been properly utilised. At the same time, studies also indicate that capital inflows have not had much impact on India's export growth or productivity.||Tanushree Mazumdar

The twin shackles that once decided matters for India's villagers, caste and agriculture, no longer exercise their vigorous hold. While a break in caste rigidities has fostered greater fluidity in occupational choices, agricultural stagnation has ensured the constant march, in increasing numbers, of employable people in the villages towards urban areas. At the same time, vote bank politics means that parties and politicians continue to pay lip-service to the cause of villages, chiefly the poor farmer. It is in the light of these changes that the 'culture' surrounding agriculture and the village needs to be understood. While this culture is not altogether a stable one, its state of pronounced flux does hold out certain portents, whether these are understood by policy-makers and the vast majority of Indians, remains open to question.||Dipankar Gupta

The Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal's (NWDT) order issued in 1979 has since been the reference point for all water development plans in the basin. The aspect of this order that this paper focuses on is the lack of any reference to groundwater when fixing allocation between the party states. It is a well-documented fact that conditions of heavy groundwater extraction often lead to decline in stream flows. This report is a critique of the premise on which the NWDT has fixed the inter-state allocation; it argues that the omission of groundwater withdrawals in the tribunal award is a serious oversight which may result in forced deviations from the decreed allocation. The case of the Narmada illustrates a condition generic to most other river basins in India - surface water allocation alone is inadequate if corresponding allocation of groundwater is not done.||Rahul Ranade

While contract farming has largely solved the problem of supply of quality raw material, cultivators of both crops have their own needs, which in some instances processors are unable or unwilling to meet. Oil palm growers, for instance, are keen on an assured minimum price while gherkin growers are totally dependent on export demand. Processors have also neglected the smaller farmers. Hence, some form of government intervention to ensure contracts are enforced and compiled with, is the need of the hour.||S. Mahendra Dev,N. Chandrasekhara Rao

The budget is noteworthy for its focus on creation of greater employment in rural areas through increased allocations for rural development and irrigation. It also acknowledges some of the important changes that need to be implemented in agriculture, including a policy for diversification, rationalisation and restructuring of subsidies and greater decentralisation. But are the fiscal allocations and the policy impetus emanating from the budget adequate to revitalise agricultural growth performance in the economy? In this regard, the budget falls short of expectations. Not much of an effort has also been made to cut the food and fertiliser subsidy and stimulate public investment in agricultural research and development. Institutional changes necessary to improve service delivery in rural areas have also not been addressed adequately.||Pooja Sharma,Ashok Gulati

No attempt was ever made to understand human development concerns and no changes were initiated to mitigate them.

This failure to show acceleration, especially in industry, is often treated as a failure of reforms to sufficiently energise the Indian economy. However, this does not warrant the conclusion that the reforms failed. There may have been less than imaginative macroeconomic policy support to growth. In particular, there was declining budgetary support to capital formation, especially in agriculture, and the bizarre case of a missing monetary policy. The growth experience of the 1990s shows that macroeconomic policy is indispensable even in peace-time so to speak, and not just during a crisis. Poor macro management might leave untravelled even the most sophisticated road maps for structural change usually termed 'economic reforms'.||Pulapre Balakrishnan

This paper addresses these questions by analysing the data on the total outstanding credit provided by the scheduled commercial banks to the agricultural sector during the period 1981 to 2000.||Gagan Bihari Sahu,D.

But can the state, a "macro subject", be explored by methods similar to that employed for the study of small-scale and bounded communities? A workshop in Delhi debated on the nature of the state as an entity that exists in and is also constantly created by society. It looked at aspects of representation and categories, through which the state seeks to define society and in turn, the latter's response to such bounded characterisation.||Roma Chatterji,Rajni Palriwala,Meenakshi Thapan

Conversely, does it form the cultures it claims to represent? In seeking answers to these questions, this paper takes up for discussion, a range of identity-based movements that have influenced and continue to play a major role in shaping the historical trajectory of south Asia. As it emerges, identity-based political forces aim to promote cultural change in two ways: (i) those that 'instrumentally' deploy cultural banners to help build broad social coalitions, as for instance, the movement for Pakistan, and (ii) the other 'purposive' type of identity movements that prioritise cultural change, specify group norms precisely and equate these with the practices they value, as seen in the instance of the Sikh movement in the 1970s and 1980s. This article is based on the text of the Sixth Neelan Tiruchelvam Memorial Lecture, delivered at the International Centre for Ethnic Studies, Colombo in July 2005.||Narendra Subramanian

The chances then are (i) government loan rates determined by market forces will reach unreasonably high levels, and (ii) this will in turn set the pattern for commercial deposit and loan rates which will not be conducive for a healthy growth in the real sector. The government and the RBI will then be left with no effective devices to contain the financial market's proclivity to push up primary yield rates on government securities to unrealistically high levels. This is happening at a time when, apart from increased borrowings by the central government, the states are being pushed to the market for higher borrowings entirely in lieu of the centre's plan loans. The situation is thus replete with dangerous implications for the macroeconomy.||EPW Research Foundation

This paper investigates whether the enactment of policy instruments in Delhi affected ambient air quality and whether CNG conversion impinged on the pollution profile. To carry out the analysis, daily ambient air quality data was used from June 1999 to September 2003 from the busiest crossing in Delhi. The results do not indicate an all-round improvement in ambient quality as NOx rose after the conversion, whereas SPM and PM10 showed only a marginal fall; CO was the only parameter that showed a significant decline. But the problem so far has been addressed from a limited perspective and there are in fact three ways to approach it: reduction in emissions per unit of fuel used; fewer vehicle kilometres travelled in total and less fuel use per vehicle kilometre travelled. Unless all three modes are enmeshed, one would not expect the air quality to improve.||Vinish Kathuria

Figures suggest that 60.6 per cent workers in Punjab are now engaged in non-agricultural activities and 46.5 per cent rural workers in Punjab have been absorbed by the non-farm sector. Such a transformation of rural economy of Punjab seems unprecedented in the face of low growth rate of employment in secondary and tertiary sectors during 1991-2001. This paper, based on an empirical study of three villages in three districts of Punjab, however, reveals the wide variations that exist with regard to the proportion of rural non-farm workers between census data and ground realities. According to this study, nearly 16 per cent of the rural workers in Punjab are engaged in the rural non-farm sector as compared to 46.5 per cent recorded by Census 2001.||Ranjit Singh Ghuman

Inhabitants of these 'peri-urban' regions are increasingly threatened by a deteriorating quality of life prompted by deforestation, water depletion and pollution as well as by the poor or almost non-existent mechanisms for sewage disposal. This article highlights the environmental dimensions associated with the spread of urban agglomerations by focusing on the problem of increased solid wastes in India's peri-urban regions. It looks at two local level initiatives formed to create a sustainable solid waste management system. But tasks such as solid waste management cannot be left to local level initiatives as community organisations lack sufficient resources or capacity to provide such a service in its entirety. Policy-makers need to give such areas more civic autonomy or provide, via the state government, a modicum of basic environmental services.||Annapurna Shaw

However, the mutual understanding between the advocates and the adversaries of conversion has not advanced much. This paper suggests that this is due to the fact that Hindus and Christians refer to two different objects when they discuss 'religion'. The traits which the Christians ascribe to religion account for the premium they put on the right to convert, while the traits of the Hindu view of religion explain the opposition to conversion. As the two parties attribute mutually exclusive properties to religion, they encounter difficulties while seeking to make sense of each other's claims about religion and conversion.||Sarah Claerhout,Jakob De Roover

On the sources side, the financing pattern of Indian firms is found to be debt based and different from that in developed countries and other emerging markets, but their share of internal sources increased markedly in the latter half of the 1990s. On the investment side, inventory investment has shown a secular decline, while investments in financial assets are on the rise. The relationship pattern between sources and uses of funds contrasts with the pattern observed for US firms, where market imperfections lead to fixed investments having a high positive association with cash flows and a high negative association with debt.||Seema Saggar

In Said's own words, his early life was a series of displacements; later in life, he came to see western culture as fundamentally a creation of exiles. But to understand the idea of exile as Said construed it, would entail a 'contrapuntal' reading of it. For Said, exile was a 'permanent' state and not as conventionally understood, a transient stage. While this contrasted ironically with his empathy for the Palestinian cause - a nation of people in exile - for Said, the exilic mind was one that refuses to habituate itself to academic pieties, to accepted readings of texts, to the satisfactions of power and to the comforts of surrender to some transcendent force.||Vinay Lal

The liberal claim rests on the impossibility of different religious communities in the same democratic polity to live together in harmony, without some model of secularism that embodies the normative force of liberty, equality and neutrality. This paper interrogates the theoretical consistency of this claim and the range of its applicability. It looks at certain judgments of the US supreme court to illustrate how a particular manner of secularism has been put together, and the challenges it poses to liberal democracy. Similarly, the judiciary in India has formed the significant site where contests under the banner of secularism have taken place in the last 50 years. Indian secularism, it appears, stretches beyond the range of secularism as understood by liberal political theory. However, it is unable to coherently hold together what might be a distinctly Indian understanding of the idea of secularism.||Mathew John

This article weaves together the public and the private at critical junctures of Bose's career to offer alternative explanatory factors for two famous journeys made by Bose. The first journey was Bose's escape from India to Nazi Germany in 1941 and the second journey was his flight from south-east Asia in 1945, a journey that was to prove his last. Looking at these 'public' actions in the light of 'private' reality, this article argues that while public, political factors did motivate Bose to undertake these journeys, he was also moved by powerful personal reasons.||Sarmila Bose

Using a decomposition model, it separates out the effects on the fiscal deficit of growth and government behaviour in the past. If recent government behaviour were to continue, the economy would need to grow at 6.1 per cent in the coming years for the centre's debt to be sustainable, a growth rate that seems eminently achievable. If a real growth rate of 6.2 per cent is posited in the coming years, only a modest degree of fiscal adjustment would be required, or none at all, to reach a tolerable level of the debt to GDP ratio by 2009-10.||T.

Yet, science and technology in India is predominantly seen as the preserve of the state, and more recently the market. In the linear model of innovation, civil society is seen at best as having a role in extension or the delivery of technology produced elsewhere. This paper, a study of science in civil society, questions this assumption through the case study of the work of a civil society-led initiative in spirulina algal technology. It highlights the need for an institutional transformation of the scientific establishment into learning organisations if they are to focus on development with a pro-poor or human face.||C.

As against the thesis of 'horizontal social movement practice' as advanced by new social movement theory, the global justice movement literature, and discourses of both the Karnataka State Farmers' Association (KRRS) as well as transnational anti-capitalist globalisation networks, the article shows the persistence of 'vertical' politics between social movements and inequalities of class, caste and gender relations that remain within social movements. Accounts of globalisation and anti-globalisation often overlook micro-level complexities but the article employs a 'situated' analysis of globalisation and shows how KRRS's social bases are excluded from transnational networks by the 'paradox of incommunicability' between castes/classes and the hierarchies that sustain them. The paper also explores the possibility for renewed collective action amongst marginalised groups, and suggests that political networks sustained via a wider social base may be more successful if wrought by a process of trickle-down solidarity.||Jonathan Pattenden

However, it does not follow that raising water prices is the natural next step for developing countries such as India. There are two broad reasons for this conclusion: first, in the near to medium term, canal water prices probably cannot be raised to the point where they significantly affect water demand. The negative impact on farm revenues would be too drastic and the policy would not find broad public support. Second, low water prices are often not the main reason behind the farmers' water-inefficient crop choices. Moreover, farm-level inefficiencies appear not to be the most significant ones on existing canals, nor are water prices the most significant prices driving irrigation demand. A better first step would be to enforce simple allocation rules - such as per-hectare rations - that would make the scarcity value of water immediately obvious. The analysis in this article is based on a study of one canal system in Maharashtra.||Isha Ray

It shows that while average tariffs have been reduced substantially since 1991-92, their overall dispersion across commodities has increased, leading to an increase in the peak to average ratio. It is also clear that the revenue potential is higher than the actual customs collection. There is thus a case for doing away with all exemptions in order to make the tariff structure more transparent.||Archana S. Mathur,Arvinder S. Sachdeva

One of the main factors determining their competitiveness would be unit cost, where India has fared poorly in the recent past. The unit cost depends upon factor prices and productivity level. The present study attempts to examine these factors in detail for the cotton yarn and garment industries for selected states using panel data analysis for 1989-97. The study suggests that large-scale production should be encouraged in this sector. Disbursement of credit, cheaper raw materials, greater availability of electricity at reasonable rates, promotion of better capacity utilisation and flexible labour laws are some other steps necessary to help the cotton yarn and garment industries become more cost-effective.||Danish A.

However, attempts by the Vedi to assert its own autonomy were hindered by the fact that it had a symbiotic relationship with the radical left political parties. While opposing the dominance of those political parties, it also relied on the latter for support. This article traces the short history of the Vedi, its attempts to chart its own independent existence, autonomous from the "party line" and how it disintegrated in the weight of own contradictions.||K.

The latter has won by participating in a "social-engineering" process, that seeks not empowerment of the lower castes but a reworking of the socio-political agenda to ensure that the upper castes regain their hold on the political establishment by co-opting individual leaders from among the backward castes and even accord them positions of prime importance. And this time the "others" in society - the OBCs and the dalits - will not give up their rights without a fight.||V. Krishna Ananth

However, with the poor outreach of the public distribution system in the tribal areas and the insufficient coverage of the AAY within each village, the yojana fails to make the difference it potentially can to the food security of the poorest of the poor. This article also evaluates the "ruchikar" (relishing) mid-day meal programme of the MP government as a result of which enrolment in schools has dramatically increased despite the poor meal quality and inadequate infrastructure. But the absence of a separate administration for meal management has placed an enormous burden on teachers, which poses a danger of further compromising the already very poor quality of primary education.||Jyotsna Jain,Mihir Shah

The twin deficit hypothesis claims that a budget deficit causes a trade deficit. At the other extreme, the Ricardian Equivalence Hypothesis (REH) rejects any possible relation between these two deficits. This paper undertakes an econometric exercise to study the impact of the fiscal deficit on India's external accounts since the mid-1980s and finds an absence of cointegration between the two deficits. Further, an absence of cointegration between the savings rate and the fiscal deficit-GDP ratio also negates the REH in Indian circumstances. These findings suggest that the ratios of trade deficit, fiscal deficit and net savings randomly maintain the national income identity and that a high fiscal deficit has been sustained by a simultaneous and independent increase in the savings ratio. Given that the savings-income ratio is already at a high level, a further increase cannot be taken for granted. However, notwithstanding the absence of a twin deficit so far, the situation offers no scope for profligacy in fiscal behaviour, both for the centre and the states.||Suparna Basu,Debabrata Datta

This is especially important in the case of women, who report higher satisfaction levels but overall have a lower access to resources.||Ligia Noronha,Subramanya Nairy

The expansion in purchasing power can come from public works financed initially, if necessary, through deficits of central and state budgets.

Pakistan has begun to accept that the LoC is here to stay. Its effort now is make it politically acceptable by getting it signified as a 'soft' border, unlike the rest of the India-Pakistan border. This approach suits India too.

A study of two novels published in the first decades of independence is revelatory of sentiments that perhaps found wider echo than portrayed in the accounts provided by the novels' protagonists - one autobiographical and the other, fictional. Decades since then have seen much shedding of the colonial 'baggage', and while the novels now appear anachronistic, they also serve, by contrast, to indicate how far Indians in the postcolonial times have 'travelled' and also much that has vanished with an older generation.||Meenakshi Sharma

Initially KSU played a decisive role in state politics, though it was not affiliated to any political party. Later, however, the other tribes and the non-tribal communities living in the state started viewing it with suspicion and fear. KSU's hegemonic role had shrunk the democratic space for the rise of other organisations within the state. It was during KSU's agitation of 2001 that Meghalayan civil society demonstrated an acceptance of liberal democratic ideas by criticising KSU's ethnocentric agenda. Khasi society is now trying to make a break from the past and open itself to criticism and self-criticism.||H. Srikanth

An analysis, based on NSSO 55th round data, shows that a high percentage of the population spends a substantial amount of its monthly income on health care. This could be compromising expenditure on essential items like food, clothing and fuel. The analysis also reveals that individuals at the lower end of the income ladder spend a disproportionate share of their income on health. Given Kerala's growing unregulated private health sector and the limited coverage by public health care, this calls for a rethink on providing 'good health at low cost'.||Asish Thomas George

The positive tone of this narrative was somewhat subdued in the 1990s by the growing literature on the problem of 'sustainability', and the 'crisis' potential of the so-called Kerala model. The crisis narrative now seems to be giving way to an emerging one of economic growth that might have indirect links with the state's earlier achievements in education and health. In this paper, an attempt has been made to present Kerala's recent development experience in terms of a couple of identifiable narratives, instead of a singular 'fact'.||Achin Chakraborty

Governments and mainstream trade unions have been largely indifferent to this sector. A number of NGOs and new trade unions have now stepped into this vacuum. Their framework of activism focuses on developmentalism of a certain kind - credit associations, slum or neighbourhood development, internationalising the issue of workers' rights - rather than on confrontational struggles over wages and working conditions. This genre of activism is based on a broad understanding of the informal sector, where a large number are self-employed, as one in which the employer-employee or capital-labour relationship is opaque, if not absent. However, this understanding and activism may indeed be limited in a context where capital is internationalised and labour is recast, into contractual, casualised, and in this case, feminised, workforce.||Supriya RoyChowdhury

Issues and Options||In recent years, some countries have set up 'super' regulators for the financial sector. In the Indian context as well, it has been suggested in some quarters that there is a need for a super regulator. As the underlying rationale for creation of a super regulator is to deal with the regulatory challenges emerging from the blurring or convergence of activities performed by providers of various financial services and the resultant overlaps, gaps, inconsistencies and uneven playing field in regulation, this paper systematically examines in detail whether and to what extent such elements are present in India. It is established that at present there are no significant regulatory overlaps/gaps, conflicts or inconsistencies. There is also no evidence of an uneven playing field amongst similar financial institutions. One significant development has been the emergence of financial conglomerates. However, their number is not very large. As such, the study argues that there is no case for a super regulator in India. Given the present institutional settings in India the institution of a super regulator could have serious ramifications for the stability of the financial system. While there is no case for a super regulator in India, the need is felt to have in place a 'lead' regulator.||Janak Raj

Water Users' Associations in Andhra Pradesh||Often lack of political will is identified as the main reason for the tardy progress in irrigation reforms at the state level. Andhra Pradesh, however, has demonstrated the political will by initiating widespread irrigation reforms through legislation. This paper, based on the situation six years after Water Users' Associations came into existence, makes an attempt to provide a comprehensive view on the status and functioning of these associations in the state. It is argued that though substantial amounts of money were spent on the reform process, money was used mainly for improving the ailing irrigation systems rather than strengthening formal institutional structures. Despite the fact that WUAs are promoted as non-political institutions, "elite capture" and political involvement dominate their functioning. More importantly, devolution of powers to WUAs has still not taken place, as most of the important functions like assessment, collection of water charges, sanctioning of works, etc, remain in the hands of the irrigation department.||V.

Traditional structures involving hereditary, non-elected headmen or chiefs appear anachronistic in the current democratic set-up. Such structures, moreover, are seen to be patriarchal and feudal, in that they bar women from holding positions of political power. At the same time, the current electoral system has been unable to provide substantive democracy as adivasis complain of being alienated from resources that had traditionally and naturally accrued to them.||Nandini Sundar

But the absence of synchronised real shocks in the past is not necessarily a reason for rejecting moves towards a common currency. In fact, with the weight of global empirical evidence, it seems clear that a common currency will facilitate greater economic integration within the south Asian region. But the potential risks of a common currency regime should not be underestimated, particularly because trade, investment and factor market linkages are still at a low level. Major policy induced barriers to the movement of goods, capital and people in the region remain. Moves towards closer monetary cooperation would be more credible if they were combined with rapid progress in these areas.||Sisira Jayasuriya,Nephil Matangi Maskay,Dushni Weerakoon,Yuba Raj Khatiwada,Shalini Kurukulasuriya

World primary energy consumption is projected to expand at an average annual growth rate of 2.1 per cent by 2020. About 70 per cent of the increase would be accounted for by non-OECD member economies, two-thirds of which are from the Asian region. The increase in demand for oil in Asia will most likely amplify the dependency on shipments from other regions (particularly west Asia). Ensuring energy security would therefore turn out to be a vital task. In east Asia, particularly, the achievement of the 'three Es' (economic development, energy security, and environmental preservation) can no longer be viewed as a task to be addressed by each country separately. Instead, it should be approached through region-wide cooperation - a goal of common interest.||Kokichi Ito,Li Zhidong,Ryoichi Komiyama

If one were to identify the single most significant break date in India's growth performance, does it turn out to be 1951-52 or 1980-81 or some such year in the post-1980s? The hypothesis in this paper is that the single most important trend break in GDP growth is to be found not in the 1980s, as the existing literature claims, but in the early 1950s. This is not because the performance of the post-1950s period was exceptional in any way, but because the performance before the 1950s was exceptionally poor. Nehruvian socialism looks dismal if seen only in the context of opportunities that were missed. If seen in the context of the actual economic performance preceding the years 1950-1980, the achievements do not seem so bleak.||Neeraj Hatekar,Ambrish Dongre

It is argued that although the Eleventh and Twelfth Finance Commissions fully recognised the importance of different fiscal parameters, like the composition of government expenditure, sources and pattern of government finances, the magnitude of debt, subsidies and interest burden, the measure of fiscal discipline, adopted by them is based on only one indicator. The Fiscal Self Reliance and Improvement Index constructed by the TFC that considers the 'change' in a single indicator is narrowly based, unstable and biased against the better fiscal performers. The suggested FPI, on the other hand, is multi-dimensional, more stable, just towards better performers and also useful for state level policy-making. The empirical analysis suggests the large inter-state variations in the level of FPI and almost continuous fiscal deterioration during the post-reform years.||Archana Dholakia

During the fertility transition Kerala's GDP per head and industrialisation have remained low, even compared with the rest of India. In general, explanations for this fertility decline have regarded Kerala as a homogeneous society and paid little attention to internal differences. However, fertility is low among the most socially and economically disadvantaged group in Kerala society, the scheduled castes, the former 'untouchables' of the traditional caste system. Thus, not only is fertility in Kerala low (1.96), but for scheduled castes it is even lower (1.52). This reversal of normal expectations is studied in the context of a scheduled caste community, the Vettuvans. The most important reason for the reversal of fertility was caste-system change triggered by land reform, Gulf migration, and democratisation of education in the state.||Saseendran Pallikadavath,Chris Wilson

The government of India has initiated anti-retroviral treatment as a part of the national public health programme in six high-prevalence states. This paper aims to examine the financial implications of initiating anti-retroviral therapy programme in the country. It highlights the importance of infrastructure and logistic requirements for developing a comprehensive treatment programme for the affected population. Finally, the paper estimates the broad financial implications of the anti-retroviral therapy under different treatment scenarios. The estimated financial requirements for treatment vary from Rs 92 crore per annum if 4,00,000 HIV/AIDS cases are covered to Rs 1,008 crore per annum if all four million patients are screened. Against this, when the programme was started the National Aids Control Organisation had allocated a total of Rs 113 crore for the treatment part of this intervention. Even under the most conservative estimate, achieving the treatment target in India with this budget will be a challenging task.||Ramesh Bhat,Somen Saha

It argues that during the various periods of Congress rule in the state there never was any dearth of efforts by the state for the inclusion of the marginalised in the power structure. However, there appear to have been a dearth of takers in the subaltern society for these state initiated efforts. In spite of successive efforts of the traditional elites - largely constituted by the upper castes in the region - the emergence of the subalterns remained confined within the parameters of upper caste-class dominance. As a result it failed to trigger social movements among the backward caste-classes, as in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The vigorous attempts by the state in the more recent period to provide better representation to the weaker sections have failed to yield the desired results primarily because of two reasons. First, the traditional elites were attempting to create an alternative social base without providing actual power and, secondly, in the absence of any corresponding effort for economic development and the unprecedented depletion of the resource base, it created a situation beyond the control of the state.||Shaibal Gupta

Developing countries do not need high tariffs for all sectors and all the time. But they should have the option of using tariffs on a selective basis as and when needed for progress in industrialisation. They should not be expected to keep moving tariffs downward from one trade round to another, but be able to move them in both directions in different sectors in the course of industrial development. The analysis in this paper suggests that this kind of flexibility is best accommodated by binding the average tariff without any line-by-line commitment; that is, to leave tariffs for individual products unbound, subject to an overall constraint that the average applied tariff rate should not exceed the bound average rate. Clearly, the average bound rate should be high enough to accommodate the needs of different sectors at different stages of industrial maturity. This would not necessarily lead to high bound average tariffs, but could in fact result in lower average tariffs than would be the case under line-by-line commitments.||Yilmaz AkyÃ¼z

Though PSBs have slowly started implementing the new age banking technology to meet the challenges, the real differentiation can only be made by fundamental reforms in the area of human resources. The managerial autonomy package recently announced by the government provides sufficient leeway to PSBs to frame their own organisation-specific HR policies and systems and leverage people capabilities to reposition themselves at the marketplace.

Further, participating NGOs overwhelmingly include business associations and interest groups, whereas grassroot organisations have little or no presence. NGOs in themselves are not democratising forces and there are important issues of autonomy, transparency and accountability that they need to address. At a more fundamental level, the WTO's method of alleviating the democratic deficit largely by involving NGOs has severe limitations.||Jayati Srivastava

In this context, the question of an anti-monarchy common minimum programme acceptable to all, including the parliamentary and revolutionary forces and international community, is important. It is the considered view of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists) that the programme of election to a representative constituent assembly and institutionalisation of the democratic republic is best suited for the purpose. No one should be in doubt that without the complete abolition of the archaic institution of feudal monarchy and its puppet, the Royal Nepal Army, no form of democracy can be secure in Nepal.||Baburam Bhattarai

Except in a few educationally forward regions of the country, secondary participation remains highly restrictive because, a majority of young people - in particular from deprived communities - do not have access to secondary education. Decisions regarding virtually all school related activities are concentrated at the state level, to the relative neglect of sub-state level and school level actors. Vocational secondary education and 'skilling' of adolescents have always received step-motherly policy attention. Interestingly, however, in the majority of the sample states, aided schools seem to have become reasonably accessible to disadvantaged groups, in sharp contrast to unaided schools. Hence there is a case for strengthening aided schools, as a potentially effective means of narrowing the gaps between the privileged youth and their disadvantaged peers.||Manabi Majumdar

While availability and accessibility relate to production and distribution, the question of affordability is linked to Amartya Sen's concepts of 'endowment' and 'exchange entitlements', that is, the resources at one's disposal that determines one's capacity to buy food. The papers in this collection on gender and food security deal precisely with this problem of endowment and exchange entitlement, especially with regard to women. They seek to draw attention to the resources, mainly employment, available to women for procuring food. However, apart from inadequate opportunities for wage labour, lack of command over productive resources acts as a major constraint on those women who do undertake farming for the household. Participation in the production of food, moreover, does not guarantee commensurate returns. All the papers deal with rice farming, but they are illustrative of the general situation regarding food security among poor women and point to the urgency of public measures for the protection of this vulnerable section.||Maithreyi Krishnaraj

It also attempts to analyse the effect of policies and institutions on the poverty-reducing impact of growth. In a panel data study for India's 15 major states, we find that economic growth is a crucial determinant of poverty reduction, but it does not provide a complete explanation. Public expenditure on anti-poverty programmes has a significant impact on rural poverty, as does greater gender equality and increased democratic decentralisation.

Empirical Evidence from TFP Analysis||Serious concerns have been raised recently about the long-run sustainability of the productivity effects of green revolution technologies in the light of the decelerating trend in the yield growth of rice since the mid-1980s under the irrigated ecosystem. However, it is also important to recognise that the changes in physical yield are not true measures of productivity from an efficiency perspective. The paper addresses the crucial issue of total factor productivity, which is a true measure of the economic efficiency of any technological impact. Results suggest that various modern technologies (such as modern varieties) adopted by the farmers over the period have continued to make a considerable impact on rice productivity growth - as reflected in the increasing trend of TFP growth. However, the rate of increase in TFP growth has started to decelerate under the irrigated ecosystem during the late GR period. This implies that the "level" of productivity impact of the successive generations of modern technologies has apparently been going down. A plateau or deceleration in TFP growth in the progressive areas is not unusual because TFP levels cannot be expected to increase at the same rate during the late GR period as it was during the early GR period.||Aldas Janaiah,Keijiro Otsuka,Mahabub Hossain

This article investigates dalit participation in these programmes and also measures aspects of physical access, participatory empowerment and community-level access.||Sukhdeo Thorat,Joel Lee
05/2/2005-11/2/2005||commentary||4416161||Agency, Externality and Corporate Governance||Corporate governance is generally defined as an area that seeks to create a structure to make managers accountable to stakeholders and to generate incentive-compatibility for 'proper' decisions to be taken by managers in a transparent manner. But even here it is not clear what 'proper' is and who the stakeholders are, as they can be viewed narrowly or broadly. Since the objectives of corporate governance are not clear in all cases, it can easily create second level agency problems such as those between a company and society at large.||Banikanta Mishra

Yet, the contours of a deal can also be seen. Hong Kong will be a test for the new WTO chief, Pascal Lamy, who as the European Commission trade commissioner pushed for the launch of the Doha round in 2001.||

An analysis of legislative measures undertaken by the government of India shows that out of the 43 legislative acts/subordinate laws administered by the banking division of the department of economic affairs, finance ministry, almost 50 per cent are in the nature of facilitating the development of the financial sector. For providing a market orientation to the financial sector the state in India earlier played a historical role and is now facilitating restructuring as well as consolidation. Providing functional autonomy and operational flexibility to public sector banks has been the main contribution of the state in facilitating market orientation of banks.||K. B. L. Mathur

Oddly, economic theory has been missing from discussions on CPRs, making it difficult to judge the status of empirical works, which, in the case of CPRs, have mainly been case studies. This paper presents a fairly complete economic theory of CPRs, identifying not only the circumstances in which communitarian institutions can function well, but also showing when these institutions could be expected to unravel. The theory also identifies an especially dark side of communitarian institutions, namely, their capacity to permit one group to exploit another within long-term relationships.||Partha Dasgupta

Given the overwhelming importance of agriculture in the state economy, a breakthrough in rainfed dryland agriculture can be said to hold the key to development of MP. The performance of the agro-ecological sub-regions within the state has been highly variable, adding another dimension to the unique significance of MP in the national scene. The state can be said to typify the two most important development experiences in India's rainfed agriculture - the near stagnation of the relatively high rainfall eastern region and the increasingly unsustainable tubewell-led agricultural development in the hard rock regions of the country. In our view, backwardness of large segments of Indian agriculture stems from an inability to develop an appropriate location-specific strategy of development for areas where the green revolution approach has no future.||P.

The 'push' factor is responsible for such migration, but as a recent workshop revealed, the prospects such work offers leave much to be desired. Living conditions are unhygienic, the salary poor and tribal women are vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous agents.||Vikas Jha

The real meaning and importance of the defence agreement becomes clear once it is situated in the wider historical, political and strategic context of a US out to establish an informal global imperium and looking for junior 'partners' to fulfil this project. And, India, in order to be accepted de facto as a 'responsible nuclear power' is committing itself to various forms of political-strategic cooperation that signal a definitive end to any idea that it will either stand up to the US' global ambitions or that it will attempt any serious role in promoting global nuclear disarmament.||Achin Vanaik

Though Indian politics has since undergone a significant shift, with the Congress entering into power-sharing arrangements with smaller formations, an unusual situation at the apex finds corollary shifts in the base of the body politic. The ascendancy of 'regional' parties and the increasing electoral clout of marginal groups have been major developments. How these forces will govern in an era of economic reform will influence India's future. Political and institutional challenges will continue to matter, but whether or not the Nehru-Gandhi clan can restore the fortunes of their party is still unclear. It will also be worth watching how the opposition re-groups and how far the ruling coalition resolves internal contradictions.||Mahesh Rangarajan

As precedents establish, the court is well within its rights to review the actions of the other two wings of the government. It is the amorality of politicians that poses the real danger to democracy.||Rajindar Sachar

The process paid attention to aspects of compensation and livelihood, ensured amenities for families and even took into account the needs of the younger generation. While an independent monitoring of the situation a few years later would provide an objective assessment of the quality of relocation, the Bhadra process is a precedent for villagers and protected areas alike.||Krithi K.

The Qatari price is lower than many contracts and this may not even be the lowest feasible price. The overarching issue for pipeline gas is one of contracting: for the delivered price, what separate metrics should one evolve for supplier nation costs, transport and transit? This relates to how the contract is set up, as a tripartite agreement between Iran, India and Pakistan, or a pair of bilateral agreements with Iran and with Pakistan.||Rahul Tongia

However, the return of peace or a status of "no-conflict" does not inevitably or necessarily allow affected peoples to resume their normal, everyday lives. Long held notions, especially those relating to identity, language and even home, begin to be questioned, while new suspicions assume an abiding permanency. As the citizen of what was once Yugoslavia takes the momentous decision to return "home", this personal account details all her experiences, emotions and doubts.||Anita Lekic

It reconfirms that there is a regional variation in fertility in India, with higher fertility in the north than in the southern and western parts, irrespective of religious affiliation. However, unless we understand the regional as well as the undocumented cross-national migration of Muslims, the picture of higher population growth rates among Muslims, reported in the 2001 Census, is likely to persist in the future, in spite of the moderate decline in their fertility.||S.

The issue of solidarity between these movements, therefore, becomes extremely crucial not only in shaping them, but also in determining the nature of social transformation in times to come. This paper is an attempt to construct a narrative of the evolution of the dalit movement through its various phases and its interaction with the Naxalite movement in Andhra Pradesh.||Ajay Gudavarthy
