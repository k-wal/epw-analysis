It is also effective in the Japanese situation, as the popularity of the quality control circles movement indicates. In the Indian context, concern for organisational stability may generate forces of resistance to environmentally desirable change. Development of a collective strategy for organisational change could be facilitated, provided the strategy does not clash with the predominant values. We still do not possess adequate insight into the predominant cultural characteristics of the administrative-managerial groups in Third World countries like India. The situation is still somewhat blurred and there is rapidity of change. Secondly, we still do not have a clear picture of how managerial values get socialised in an organisation system and to what extent technology influences the values of the managers. Having admitted these limitations and gaps in our knowledge, we can still make the proposition that cultural relativity reflected in managerial values would be an important parameter in the organisational change process - particularly in determining the training needs of managers to become change agents in revitalising organisations.||Nitish R.
