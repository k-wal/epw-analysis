It is found that an increase in village electrification by one percentage point may result, on the average, in an increase of half to two-thirds of a percentage point in the rate of utilisation of groundwater potential. The impact is likely to be greater if rural electrification is undertaken in low rainfall and semi-arid areas, because the rate of utilisation and rainfall are negatively related with each other. For investment in rural electrification in high rainfall areas to have the maximum impact, it is necessary to simultaneously strengthen agricultural extension services, long and short-term credit institutions, land consolidation work and other land reform measures.||Nazim A.

As the canal network is extended and the available water has to be spread over a larger area the head reach farmers mount resistance to reduction of their water supply. This paper describes the administrative effort that was needed to prevent paddy being raised in irrigated dry blocks and on land which was not entitled to irrigation at all on the Tungabhadra High Level Canal in southern Andhra Pradesh. Case studies such as this may help to get a clearer idea of the potential for using control over irrigation water as a policy instrument for inducing desired changes in cropping pattern.||Robert Wade

It is also effective in the Japanese situation, as the popularity of the quality control circles movement indicates. In the Indian context, concern for organisational stability may generate forces of resistance to environmentally desirable change. Development of a collective strategy for organisational change could be facilitated, provided the strategy does not clash with the predominant values. We still do not possess adequate insight into the predominant cultural characteristics of the administrative-managerial groups in Third World countries like India. The situation is still somewhat blurred and there is rapidity of change. Secondly, we still do not have a clear picture of how managerial values get socialised in an organisation system and to what extent technology influences the values of the managers. Having admitted these limitations and gaps in our knowledge, we can still make the proposition that cultural relativity reflected in managerial values would be an important parameter in the organisational change process - particularly in determining the training needs of managers to become change agents in revitalising organisations.||Nitish R.
