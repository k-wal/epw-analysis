The results of the review question the view that the way out of underdevelopment for the countries of the Third World today lies in raising the level of saving and capital formation and that, once this is done, other things, like social institutions, will take care of themselves.||Sushil Khanna

But when peasant interests were circumscribed by indigenous landed interests, the Congress under Gandhi counselled mutual trust and understanding and compromised continuously in favour of Indian vested interests. This paper traces the development of Gandhi's views on the relationship between zamindars and kisans in colonial India and discusses how his ideology on the peasant question influenced his actions as the leader of the national movement.||Abha Pandya

This paper seeks to analyse the factors underlying the marked deceleration in the rate of industrial growth, which transformed a scenario of relatively rapid industrialisation into a situation of persistent quasi-stagnation. Section II of the paper examines the trends in industrial production and establishes the fact of deceleration in growth. Section III provides a critical review of the alternative explanations for stagnation in the industrial sector. Section IV attempts to focus attention on factors which have, in a relative sense, been neglected by the literature on the subject, and explores the relationship between income distribution, the demand factor and industrial growth. Section V is directed towards developing a unified hypothesis about the sluggishness of growth in India's industrial sector since the mid-1960s.||Deepak Nayyar

The objective seems to be to prepare area-specific blueprints for development and to decentralise planning. Area planning is concerned with allocations of resources among competing activities and areas, using the given resource configurations of areas as initial conditions. Given the differential factor prices and comparative advantages for specific activities in different areas, resource and factor mobility could result in greater equalisation of resources among areas. Area planning has also to be justified through the greater participation of the people for whom it is meant. Indian plans, from the First Five-Year Plan onwards, have recognised both these rationales for area planning. In every succeeding plan, the area approach has manifest itself in different forms: the community development programme, intensive agriculture area programmes, panchayati raj, special schemes for weaker sections, drought-prone areas, command areas, hill areas, tribal areas, and so on. Yet operational area plans have almost never been drawn up - even when there was sufficient manpower and in states which have implemented democratic decentralisation with great zeal. What is needed is greater attention to supportive processes, instruments, and agencies, rather than continued concern with further sophistication in methodologies and pious hopes of evolving 'replicable' methodologies.||Shreekant Sambrani

Past experiences show that planning based on this type of supply models was partially successful, at least until the mid-sixties, in creating production capabilities in the economy. But it failed on two major accounts: (i) it failed rather miserably to regulate the income distribution and (ii) it failed to evolve a set of appropriate policies to manage demand. Incidentally, the Draft Plan has also implicitly recognised these failures. Both these aspects have assumed special significance now, with the major thrust of the present Draft Plan on employment generation and eradication of poverty.||R. Radhakrishna,Atul Sarma

Three turning points in the price series are first identified and explained. The influence of some factors known to have a major impact on price behaviour is next examined in quantitative terms. Concentrating on two price series - the price index of cereals and of manufactured products - forecasts are worked out on the basis of two selected regression equations whose coefficients were estimated from annual data over the period 1952-1970. The forecast prices and year-to-year percentage changes are compared with the actuals. A few significant discrepancies are identified and possible explanations are discussed. On the whole, however, the forecast percentage changes are found to be quite close to the actual recorded values, thus reaffirming the relevance of the suggested explanatory factors and the validity of the hypotheses relating to their mode of operation as depicted by the chosen equations.||Santi K.

03/6/1978- ||special articles||4366686||Political Dimensions of Health and Health Services||Political forces play a dominant role in the shaping of health services of a community. In addition to its being used as an instrument for alleviation of the suffering that is caused by diseases in individuals and in communities, health services have also been used as a political device to increase dependence for exploitation of one class by another and to promote certain vested market interests. The colonial powers had used the health services to strengthen their grip over the population of the subjugated countries. These countries were thus plunged straight from a pre-industrial health culture to a colonial pattern of health culture. Most of the newly independent countries of the Third World not only broadly followed the old colonial pattern of health services which subserve mostly small elite classes, but the privileged-class-oriented health services also absorbed more and more resources as they developed strong overtones of dependence and commercialisation of the health services of the ex-colonial powers. Social scientists and health educators have been deployed to justify this pattern of health care. Case studies, involving three categories of countries, bring into focus the political determinants of the health service system in the Third World countries. However, it is often overlooked that efforts to alleviate the suffering caused by health problems can, in turn, contribute to the initiation of action on political, economic and social planes. This offers a strategic entry point, and the health services can contribute to the generation of self-confidence among the exploited masses by making suffering-alleviation as part of an overall effort to change their economic, social and political status.||D.

30/9/1978- ||review of agriculture, september 1978||41497101||Farm Size and Productivity Revisited: Some Notes from Recent Experience of Punjab||On the basis primarily of farm management data a number of economists have come to conclusions about the relationship between farm size and productivity. While a majority of them have seen an inverse relationship? between the two and offered a variety of explanations for this, a few have felt that this generalisation cannot hold for all-India. The Green Revolution in the late sixties, by increasing the component of capital inputs, may have made a difference to the earlier conclusions. This paper, therefore, looks into the changing structure of capital and its effect on resource productivity. Punjab is chosen to study these effects, because it has a predominantly owner-cultivated agrarian structure and also has data from the earlier farm level studies. The analysis suggests that factors which drive small fanners towards more intensive cultivation, if combined with wherewithal that further permit them to do so, can help small farmers compete with large farmers in all aspects of production technology — except in investment on size-biased machinery and implements for which farm-size alone is the constraint. Clearly, the long-abandoned co-operative network is best suited to make up for the input deficiencies and give small farmers the competitive base they need in Indian agriculture.||G K Chadha

The conclusion which emerges from this survey of some recent studies of the impact of protective discrimination is that neither altering the criteria of distribution nor restricting the benefits of protective discrimination to elite groups will be effective. What is needed is that the situational constraints highlighted by the various studies should be removed through an integrated programme for the dispersal of the benefits. The relationship between inequalities and facilities should be inverted so as to affect the underlying system of inherited inequalities.||Karuna Ahmad

25/3/1978- ||review of agriculture, march 1978||4366464||Real Wages, Employment, and Income of Agricultural Labourers||An increase in agricultural production implies an increase in the income of all strata of the agrarian population; given the fact that Indian agriculture has made significant strides with the new technology, it should result in a rising demand for labour and thereby higher real wages for agricultural labourers - this is the central theme of a paper by Deepak Lal titled 'Agrarian Growth, Real Wages and the Rural Poor in India'. A similar argument is found also in an earlier paper by Herdt and Baker dealing with the same subject. There are, however, numerous other studies on Indian agriculture, which on the basis of available empirical evidence seem to highlight the opposite phenomenon and dwell on a theme of unequal sharing of benefits within agriculture. Such studies give support to what Deepak Lal calls a 'new orthodoxy' on income distribution in agriculture. He also raises doubts about the factual basis of such studies, where apparently the authors have arrived at pessimistic and even erroneous conclusions, becuase they all have analysed the wrong kind of data. This paper is primarily an attempt at defending the data that seem to support the 'new orthodoxy' hypothesis. In the process, we also raise some questions on the validity of the hypothesis, implicit in all such studies, that wage rates of agricultural labourers are directly determined by the supply-demand conditions in the rural labour market and that changes in the market situation can be measured by the movement of wage rates. In Section I, we look into the relative merits and demerits of the different sources of agricultural wage data. In Section 11, making use of the information available in the various enquiries, we attempt to explain how in the Indian context factors other than wage rates might be crucial in the determination of real earnings of agricultural labour households. In Section III we examine the relative changes in the real earnings of agricultural labour households derived from wage employment in different states between 1963-64 and 1970-71. A comparison of these indices of income with those agricultural wage rate indices for the same period brings out clearly that the latter are inadequate to explain trends in the income of agricultural labourers in the different states.||A.

This paper locates allopathic doctors in India in terms of their social organisation and values, and considers the attempts which have been made to secure and extend their autonomy and monopoly. It is argued that nascent professionalisation on the model of the developed countries was discernible in India by the 1920s, largely as a result of sponsorship by British doctors and by the imperial State. However, since then, allopathic doctors in India have lost ground. Their indigenous competitors have produced a situation of medical oligopoly; the political structures have intruded more deeply into decision-making on promotions, entrance to medical college, and the establishment of new medical colleges. As a result, the Western doctors are experiencing deprofessionalisation, in that they have lost autonomy both within and outside public employment, and have been vulnerable to political intrusions, though they continue to enjoy power and prestige. These trends are to be understood as results of the dependent position of India in the medical world, and as a result of the nature of post-colonial society within India.||Roger Jeffery

This article attempts to answer these broad questions concerning female labour in India by presenting an individual profile: 'Kalyani', a 35-year old female agricultural labourer belonging to the scheduled caste, living in a squatter settlement in Trivandrum. The principal strands of this profile are that 'Kalyani' is only one link in a long chain of agricultural labourers stretching back to generations; that her children, despite whatever 'education' they have been able to receive, will continue in the same occupation; that hunger, disease and indebtedness are an integral part of their life; that there is little prospect of anyone in the family breaking out of this vicious circle.||Leela Gulati

One, that ownership of leasable land is increasingly getting distributed among an ever larger number of petty lessors; and two, that simultaneously there has also been a tendency for the leased-in land to get concentrated in fewer hands. This paper, which is based on data from Hoogly district in West Bengal, finds that the lease market in the villages of Hoogly conforms neither to the conventional pattern of a few big lessors leasing out land in small parcels to a large number of lessees, nor to the new pattern that is said to be emerging in many parts of India, a pattern characterised by leased-in land tending to get concentrated in the hands of a few tenants. This feature of the Hoogly lease market, it is argued, owes its origin to the nature of the district's economy, the composition of its population, and its proximity to metropolitan Calcutta.||Debidas Ray

The people of India have been kept ignorant, initially by Nehru who, fearful that his liberal image may be tarnished here and abroad, drew the proverbial iron curtain around the subject; his successors have found the curtain useful. Of the repression and the suffering inflicted upon the people of the North-East there is very little record. What is on record is the policy followed by the Home Ministry, shrouded in the mystique of national security and, therefore, secure from the public gaze. The policy has had two notable parts: the first, a military strategy of economic suppression; the second, a political strategy of divide-and-rule. The policy has had a tragic 25-year trial. Its failure has been kept from the people of India.||Amritha Rangasami

These objectives are: (i) wider territorial and regional spread of the banks' branch network; (ii) larger mobilisation of financial savings through bank deposits; and (iii) reorientation of credit deployment in favour of small producers and the disadvantaged classes. Any reorientation of commercial bank lending in favour of 'priority' areas perforce implies a critical questioning of credit absorption by the medium and large-scale industries to which the banks were largely accustomed to lending and which had absorbed two-thirds of bank credit, even though contributing only about one-tenth to the net domestic product or less than 25 per cent to the gross value of output of commodity producing sectors. Significant structural changes in the deployment of commercial bank credit requires purposeful action on three planes: (i) rigorous control on the pre-emption of credit by medium and large-scale industries; (ii) prescription of policies and instruments for directing credit in favour of the designated 'priority' areas; and (iii) development of a framework of instruments and institutions. This paper makes an attempt at analysing the performance of commercial banks during the post-nationalisation period in regard to all of these specific aspects.||S. L. Shetty
1/8/1978- ||'new' development strategy||4366859||The New Development Strategy: An Appraisal||In the Draft Five-Year Plan 1978-83 we have not only a new Plan but also a New Strategy of Development. The crucial issue in the New Strategy is not its objectives, for they are only reaffirmations and specifications of universally accepted goals. It cannot also be the internal consistency of its technical calculations, for that can be easily produced. The economic and social forces available to implement it are the key factors in understanding and evaluating a development strategy. The Draft Plan's reasoned assessment that so far "the most important objectives of planning have not been achieved" is not only a judgment on past planning and policies but an indication of the manner in which our economic system functions. If what happened in the past was counter to the declared intentions of planning, it must be inferred that there are forces in the system that propel it along different courses. For all its good intentions, careful calculations and bravado, the weakness of the New Development Strategy is that it has not bothered to locate these forces and suggest how they can be dealt with. The planners have been quick to grasp that the major constricting factor in the development of the Indian economy along the path it has been taking so far is the limitation of the domestic market. Export promotion and diffusion of purchasing power internally are the remedies they have for this malady. Could it be that the New Development Strategy of the Plan is only an attempt to achieve the latter in the name of the universally accepted social aims of the Indian people and of the poor who are always to be with us?||C.

The three major socio-economic characteristics of the households considered in this paper that would determine the levels of income are (a) size of the sample households, (b) educational levels of the heads of and other workers in the households, and (c) occupational status of heads of households as well as of all workers in the households. These three characteristics are taken separately and their relationship to income distribution studied in order to find out different aspects of the problem of income distribution in an urban area. This helps to understand how urban income distributed differently among the same households gets when it is considered in relation to the three different criteria.||H. G. Hanumappa

08/4/1978- ||special articles||4366505||Approach to Foreign Collaboration: A Critique of New Industrial Policy||It is now widely recognised that foreign collaboration, while performing the 'gap-filling' functions in the growth process also produces technological dependence. Hence every country, irrespective of the political character of the government, invariably introduces policy measures of some sort for regulation and control of foreign capital and technology. Indeed, the political character of the government, in the sense of the degree of radical approach in its economic policies, would be reflected in the objectives and nature of the control-mechanism: whether the policies are aimed at modifying the deleterious consequences, or at attacking the problem of technological dependence as such. India, where the inflow of foreign capital and technology has been sizeable, has also been pursuing a 'selective policy', for controlling the entry and operations of foreign capital and technology, through various administrative instruments forged within the framework of the industrial policy. The Indian policy on foreign collaboration was originally set out in the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948, and modified from time to time along with the changes introduced in its industrial policy. In a historical sense, the Industrial Policy Statements and Resolutions have been providing the framework of approach for foreign collaboration in India. The Statement on Industrial Policy recently laid before the Parliament provided an opportunity for the new Government to look afresh at foreign collaborations in the light of past experience and to enunciate a rational approach. This paper examines the new approach from the viewpoint of its adequacy, for at least modifying the consequences, if not tackling the problem, of technological dependence resulting from foreign collaboration.||K.

However, the success of a society in using a resource for development, particularly an elemental resource like irrigation, depends equally on the characteristics of the human factor and of the communities undergoing the process of change. The purpose of this note is to bring out some of these links between irrigation and development and suggest that the crucial constraints in the Indian case are likely to be institutional and socio-economic in nature.||V.

Depending upon the source of data on wage rates of male agricultural labour, the terminal years used for comparisons, the index numbers used for deflating money wages, and so on, the authors have drawn different conclusions about the trends in the real wag rates of agricultural labour. For studying the levels of living of agricultural labour, the level of income is more important than the wage rate, nominal or real. The wage rate is only one of the determinants of income; the other crucial factor is the level of employment. True, data on employment and earnings of agricultural labour are scanty. The more meaningful and rewarding task for researchers should, therefore, be to attempt to fill this gap than to continue with the interminable debate on trends in real wage rates. In the present paper an attempt is made to study the level of employment, income and food intake among selected agricultural labour households in Kuttanad, the 'rice bowl' of Kerala.||P. G. K.

11/11/1978- ||special articles||4367083||Role of China in International Relations||The complex role that is presently being played by China in international relations has its roots deeply imbedded in Chinese history. Throughout this history, a great deal of importance was attached to China's relationship with the rest of the world; but it was not until the revolutionary movement launched by the Chinese Communist Party in the 1920s that attention was given to the question of the interrelationship between the construction of socialism in China and the role of China in international relations. This paper seeks to set out various aspects of this inter-relationship since 1949 when the Chinese revolution achieved its final victory. The paper is in three parts. Part I, which is published this week, presents a broad historical survey of the development of China's foreign policy. Parts II and III, to be published in the coming weeks, are devoted to specific aspects of China's role in international relations before and since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.||T. V.

The Indian State has had to continuously increase its expenditure on the army and the police during the last thirty years, because the ruling classes feel threatened by the emerging social forces which are struggling against exploitation. As the crisis of capitalist development deepens, the coercive role of the State assumes greater importance than any legitimation provided by the democratic instruments of elections and citizens' participation.||C.

It is as much as was achieved in one hundred years under the British empire. The pace of completion of canal networks, most of them from major storage reservoirs, will have to be stepped up one-third above the already accelerated pace of building in 1977-78. Utilisation of the potential created calls for field channels, for land levelling, for demonstration farms, ayacut roads, etc; in other words, for an entire new set of links between the government canals and the farmers' fields. Under the pressure to get the physical links installed without delay - the field channels and the reshaping of fields, especially - Command Area Development authorities are tending to rely more and more heavily upon the weight of their technical expertise and their existing or requested legal authority to get on with the job. This trend is both visible and understandable in mid-1978. The question is whether the paternalism involved in this strategy will, over the coming years, prove compatible with the active roles cultivators are now taking as voters, as entrepreneurs producing for a changing national market.||Henry C.

The undue privileges enjoyed by the British in Tibet were based only on the secret Anglo-Tibetan Trade Regulations of 1914 concluded without the knowledge of the Chinese. The real choice was either to relinquish these privileges or to risk forcible expulsion from Tibet. There was a duality in the Indian attitude to the Simla Convention of 1914. Nehru was agreeable to disowning the extra-territorial rights in Tibet inherited from the Simla Convention. On the other hand, he was determined to maintain the McMahon Line of the Simla Convention as India's north-eastern frontier with China. Nehru, therefore, decided against bringing the frontier problem into the agenda for the Tibetan treaty negotiations.||K. Gupta

This article, however, argues that out of the six lakh odd villages in the country less than 42,000 neea concern the marketing man. Even among these, he should concentrate on the feeder market villages. Despite the disparity and the concentration of affluence in rural areas which this reflects, the number of rural consumers who can afford branded products is nevertheless equal to, if not more than, the number of such urban consumers. The existing rural market is examined here, its development anticipated, and the arrangements and methods of popularising and distributing products in the countryside examined.||Mandira Dutta Balakrishnan

Section I of the present paper elaborates this point. To formulate a strategy of rural development one has first to characterise the rural sector - that is, one has to identify the major bottlenecks in growth, determine the way in which these hindrances interact mutually and with other forces in the economy, and therefrom deduce the means of resolving the problem. Sections II and III of the paper are devoted to these issues. Section IV sets out some concluding observations on the strategy of economic planning for rural development.||Ranjit Sau

According to the NNC, except for a century of British rule, the Nagas had never been subjugated and ruled by other people and had never been part of what today constitutes the Indian Union. This feeling of separateness from the rest of India is widely shared by the Nagas and has sustained them in their protracted struggle against a very powerful adversary. This article examines the historical and sociological basis for this persistent consciousness among the Naga people that they constitute a separate and independent 'nation'.||Udayon Misra

The risk attitude experiments form part of a larger research programme carried out by ICRISAT to assess the effects of risk and risk aversion on the agriculture of these regions. The research programme is aimed at testing the hypothesis that the high levels of production risks in the semi-arid tropics coupled with risk aversion leads to underinvestment in agriculture by farmers relative to the expected profit maximising levels.||Hans P.

It then goes on to consider the relationship between history and anthropolgy, and between colonialism and anthropology. It describes the nature of the colonial transformation of the tribal society in relation to the political system, social structure, economic and agrarian institutions and movements and shows how and where the processes of colonial transformation in the tribal and peasant societies in India ran parallel and diverged, and how they related to the over-arching colonial system. An attempt is made towards the end to identify the areas where anthropologists and historians may explore the possibilities of collaboration in the investigation of tribal society.||K. S. Singh

This paper argues that such types of intervention provide at best opportunities to a limited number of individuals for upward mobility within the existing order. What is required is change in the institutions and processes of society which seeks to alter the way in which the major social institutions distribute fundamental rights and duties and determine the divsion of advantages from social co-operation. The challenge before the poor, and those who would ally themselves with them, is to determine the types of interventions in the social, economic and political order which are capable of eroding structural inequalities and effectively involving the poor in society.||Ralph H.

It is found that an increase in village electrification by one percentage point may result, on the average, in an increase of half to two-thirds of a percentage point in the rate of utilisation of groundwater potential. The impact is likely to be greater if rural electrification is undertaken in low rainfall and semi-arid areas, because the rate of utilisation and rainfall are negatively related with each other. For investment in rural electrification in high rainfall areas to have the maximum impact, it is necessary to simultaneously strengthen agricultural extension services, long and short-term credit institutions, land consolidation work and other land reform measures.||Nazim A.

Some limited empirical evidence suggests that: (a) variations in rent and productivity are associated with the tenant's economic status (as indicated by the size of operational holding); (b) variations in terms and conditions of leases are linked to the relative economic strengths of the tenants and the cultivators (i e, dominant rent receivers exploit the weaker tenant cultivators through rent and lease agreements). Moreover, the agricultural census reveals that (i) tenant cultivators predominate on small farms, and that (ii) small farms constitute over 50 per cent of operational holdings though they account for nine per cent of cultivated area. The pure tenant category, what is more, essentially comprises low castes. This paper focuses on different tenurial categories according to the social caste hierarchy, with reference to Mori village of the East Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh.||V. N. Reddy,C. S. Murthy

However, while there has been a significant increase in foodgrains production, the increase in productivity has been confined to cereals. In fact, there has been a declining trend in pulses production. The breakthrough via HYVs in cereals has been accompanied by a loss of acreage under pulses to cereals, and consequently a sharp decline in the total production of pulses. Moreover, there has been no breakthrough in the productivity of pulses, nor has enough effort been made to achieve it and spread it through extension work into areas and seasons where cereal yields are low. Given the nutritional importance of pulses, this paper argues that an increase of 40 to 50 per cent is essential to meet the present protein gap in the country.||B. L. Kumar

13/5/1978- ||special articles||4366620||Growth Rates||Quite often, we find in economic literature, several loose statements about how the rate of growth of an Economy has been rising or falling or constant over time, essentially taking into account two or three observations. In a few cases these statements are based on fitting a particular growth curve without examining its empirical appropriateness and along with it sometimes providing partial information on the desirable statistical measures of goodness of fit as indicated by R̄2, Dw and T values. This paper observes that the above statistical measures of goodness of fit are inadequate to determine the exact nature of the trend curve describing the underlying data. In fact, from the same data, it is possible to arrive at acceleration, or deceleration, or constancy, of growth by considering different growth curves. Thus, the researcher may get away with whatever he wants to show. However, this paper attempts to overcome the difficulty of choosing an appropriate growth curve describing the underlying growth phenomenon by taking into account the accuracy of estimated growth rates as measured by the standard error (or coefficient of variation) of growth rates along with the above statistical measures of goodness of fit. The simple growth curves, like linear, log-linear, and Gompertz, are considered to analyse statistically the underlying time series data. The statistical analysis, consisting of fitting the growth curves, estimating the growth curves, estimating the growth rates and its standard errors, and choosing an appropriate growth curve, is tedious and time-consuming. And the results based on it are valid only under certain conditions. Use of appropriate non-parametric statistics, known for their simplicity, is suggested for broadly indicating the direction of growth rates - that is, whether they are rising, or falling, or constant over time. In this connection Kendall's K statistic and Spearman's rank correlation co-efficient rsare calculated to examine the association between annual observed growth rates and time 't'. The comparative merits of the non-parametric study, which broadly indicates the direction of growth rates, and the usual statistical analysis, which provides both the direction and dimension of growth rates, are assessed by using the data of the Indian economy on real net national product, industrial product, and agricultural production, for the period 1950/51 to 1973/74. The sensitivity analysis of the growth curves is also examined by fitting the growth curves (and also calculating K and rs) for subperiods of interest - namely 1950/51 to 1960/61; 1950/51 to 1964/65; 1950/51 to 1973/74; 1960/61 to 1973/74; 1964/65 to 1973/74; and 1967/68 to 1973/74.||V.

It is, therefore, proposed in this paper to present a brief review of the anatomy of agricultural growth in India over the past decade and a half and then to examine which policy instruments were or were not appropriate during this period and their future role in improving the performance of agriculture, not only in terms of aggregate growth but also in terms of equity.||M.

For purposes of national integration many segments of this plural society have to be coalesced in a pattern of unity in diversity: religion, language, region, culture, class, and social stratification. The present article focuses attention on religion and language as applicable to the largest of India's minorities, the Muslims. It questions the common assumptions about the Muslims as constituting a 'minority' in the Indian context, consisting as they do, in aggregate terms, of more than six crore people. It argues that the so-called 'Muslim problem', like the 'Hindu problem', is in fact the problem of India because the Hindus and the Muslims are the only two all-India communities who are fragmented regionally, linguistically, culturally and ethnically, and whose problems have a relevance at each level and for all sectors of national life.||Rasheeduddin Khan

Instead of the traditional production function approach, an alternative scheme of analysis based on the 'yardsticks of the use of technological factors' is developed and used. The analysis contradicts the popular hypothesis that the new varieties are, by and large, responsible for the green revolution in India. Even in the case of wheat, which has registered nearly 40 per cent yield increase, high yielding varieties contribute a mere 26 per cent of the yield growth while the share of the other two factors is 74 per cent. Overall, the share of the new varieties of seed is 15 per cent. The share of fertilisers and irrigation is 30 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively. Of the growth of overall agricultural productivity, 33 per cent is unexplained in the study.||Vidya Sagar

27/5/1978- ||review of management, may 1978||4366659||Decision Making in the Public Sector: Case Study of Swaraj Tractor||The characteristic feature of the development process since World War II has been the deliberate assumption by the State of the function of regulating the pace and pattern of socio-economic development. In a large number of LDCs, the State is also playing an active role in promoting and managing enterprises in the manufacturing sector. The functioning and growth of these enterprises depend on the decision-making process in the public sector. This process of decision making, which is complex enough in the private sector, is inevitably much more complex in the public sector. This case study of the Swaraj tractor has been undertaken with a view to understanding the problem of decision-making in public manufacturing enterprises in India. The paper is divided into five sections. Section I provides some information about the tractor industry in general. Section II narrates the story of the Swaraj tractor. In Sections III and IV some problems about the decision-making process are raised and some conjectures made about public sector behaviour. In the final section, an attempt is made to formulate some explanatory hypotheses about the public sector decision-making process - hypotheses that many have general relevance for the LDCs with mixed economies.||V.

To understand the full implications of this involvement, one has to consider the evolution of the fish economy as a whole. The present article attempts this task. Part I presents the characteristics of the aquatic terrain and the potential and exploited marine resources of India's Exclusive Economic Zone; Part II attempts a brief review of the fish economy; and Part III highlights the crucial issues which confront Indian deep-sea fishing interests and their impact on the whole fish economy.||John Kurien

The present system of taxation plays no effective role at all in reducing inequalities in the distribution of disposable incomes. This is because there is no proper balance between indirect and direct taxes in the tax structure. If the tax system is to be of any help in reducing inequalities in disposable incomes, it will be necessary to focus the thrust of tax changes ondirect taxes, like the income-tax. Also required of the finance minister is clear thinking on another problem: Given the Janata party's socio-economic goals, what kind of goods should be produced in the country and what is it that fiscal policy can do to encourage the production of these goods and discourage the production of the others?||Anand P.

To clear off the backlog of unemployment, direct measures of employment promotion are necessary. However, programmes which provide additional work but at a wage rate which is inadequate even for minimum living will be self-defeating. There is a strong case for a rural works programme. But an ambitious plan to cover all the rural unemployed under it is neither necessary nor feasible. What is needed is a judicious mix of rural works projects, development measures for industries allied to agriculture, and a minimum needs programme, keeping in view income-generating as well as productivity-raising considerations.||J.

As the canal network is extended and the available water has to be spread over a larger area the head reach farmers mount resistance to reduction of their water supply. This paper describes the administrative effort that was needed to prevent paddy being raised in irrigated dry blocks and on land which was not entitled to irrigation at all on the Tungabhadra High Level Canal in southern Andhra Pradesh. Case studies such as this may help to get a clearer idea of the potential for using control over irrigation water as a policy instrument for inducing desired changes in cropping pattern.||Robert Wade

Nestle is an exception. The company's policies and practices in Third World countries have been the object of so much criticism that it has undertaken to state its own case. It has thus been possible to make the facts, figures and documents provided by Nestle itself the basis of the present study. This paper attempts to show that Nestle's impact on underdeveloped countries is harmful where the promotion of its infant foods is concerned, that the company is prepared to use questionable means to defend itself against critics and further that it cannot be expected to modify substantially its present tactics. The author also contends that the bargain prices paid for local raw materials and salary level in Third World countries give Nestle every incentive to increase production in these countries.||Susan George

But what perhaps has not been fully comprehended is that the growth of exports in real terms has been very moderate and it has been achieved at tremendous cost to the national exchequer. In this study on attempt has been made to assess the real growth rates of India's exports in the seventies and the costs of export promotion measures to the national exchequer.

It is obvious in all these years, the country has not succeeded in implementing the language provisions of the Constitution. With the advent of the Janata government at the Centre and the near-total defeat of the Janata party in the Lok Sabha elections in many non-Hindi states, new apprehensions have arisen in the non-Hindi areas about the language issue. This is therefore an opportune time to have a fresh look at the language issue, review the progress made in the implementation of the solution provided by the Constitution and make suggestions for the future:||V.

In the concrete Indian context of the near assetlessness of the poor, programmes for actual transfer of assets are a prerequisite for using asset improvement and fuller utilisation of labour power as mechanisms for creating an income-earning potentiality, whereby the poor can raise their consumption levels upto or above the poverty line used by the Plan. The problem in any major effort at asset-transfer is not merely one of changing the rules of the game in providing institutional credit to the poor, but the much more fundamental one of finding the required real resources and directly transferring them to the poor - with the attendant problems of macro and micro balances.||K.

03/6/1978- ||special articles||4366685||Class Relations in Indian Agriculture: I||The author, in the course of this article, develops and presents a thesis regarding the class composition of the Indian agricultural population. The thesis is that there are only two classes in Indian agriculture, one of which is termed 'the class of big landowners' the other 'the class of agricultural labourers'. These two classes are in antagonistic contradiction with each other, and this contradiction constitutes the principal contradiction in our rural society. The thesis implies rejection of the commonly accepted class differentiation in terms of agricultural labourers, poor peasants, middle peasants, rich peasants, landlords, etc. While recognising that this scheme is sanctified because of its formulation and application by Lenin and Mao Tse-tung, the author argues that the scheme is not helpful when it comes to Indian conditions. By 'helpful', is meant helpful from the point of view of practice. In this, the author's idea is the fundamental Marxian thought that the only test of the correcteness of theories and the usefulness of concepts lies in their application in practice. The article will appear in three parts. This, the first part, considers the concept of mode of production and certain features of capitalist relations. Part two, to follow, considers some features of feudal relations. Part three, which concludes the discussion, describes the ruling class in Indian agriculture.||Ashok Rudra

The paper is in four parts. Part I analyses the extent of overcrowding of the agricultural sector in the district. Part II analyses the distribution of holdings according to size. Part III lists out the types and nature of agricultural implements used today and compares the picture with that of the beginning of this century. Part IV briefly discusses the question of diffusion of technical information, and the socio-cultural factors which have a bearing upon the problem of modernisation of tribal agriculture.||Sitakant Mahapatra

30/9/1978- ||special article||41497095||Multi-Fibre Policy for Implications of Cotton Textile Industry||The manner in which the multi-fibre policy, and the reasons for its introduction, have been phrased raises a number of questions. First, to what extent has the shortfall in production of raw cotton been responsible for the rapid increase in raw material prices and to what extent has it affected the different producers in the industry? Secondly, since much of the textile industry (excepting the sick, technically backward, and hope" fully'-to-be-rehabilitated mills) is in the hands of the private sector, why has not the industry itself responded by shifting to the use of man-made fibres if the latter is more profitable and why the need for an enforced regulation on the use of man-made fibres? And, finally, since the textile industry caters to a rather vast and highly divergent group of consumers, and since man-made fibres consist of d broad spectrum varying from the high-cost ployster beyond the reach of a majority of consumers to the low-cost viscose fibre, exactly which producers' and which consumers will such a policy serve? An attempt is made in this paper to relate the emerging policy to the context and character of the textile industry's development, and to identify the impact of the policy on different sections of producers and consumers. This provides a basis for assessing the extent to which the policy will help in resolving the crisis of demand and profitability in the industry.||C P Chandrasekhar,Mridul Eapen
1/2/1978- ||planning for employment||4366355||Some Neglected Issues in Employment Planning||The public works approach to unemployment would make sense if it is so organised that there will be progressively less and less reliance on it, so that ultimately it becomes redundant. Its role should be accepted as transitional, and deliberate efforts should be made to rehabilitate those engaged on public works within the mainstream of the economic system. Unless this perspective is strongly emphasised there is every possibility that a pernicious type of dualistic economy would be perpetuated under which - given the magnitude of existing unemployment and underemployment and the expected additions to the labour force - we will end up with two segments of the economy, one providing 'regular employment' to those who are lucky enough to have some productive assets (property or skill) and the other a hapless contingent of employment seekers wholly dependent on those in charge of public works, as and when and where these are organised.||M.

The operational issues can be summed up in the form of two questions: If the policy of protection and support to the small sector is meant primarily for the small scale industrial units in the modern sector, why should it be so? If it is meant for the village and household production units, how is it to be made effective? These questions can be answered only within the framework of a clearly articulated notion of the long-term directions for the economy as a whole. And that is the one aspect which the industrial policy statement neatly evades.||C. T. Kurien

Growth of national income during this period has been slower and there have been sharp year-to-year fluctuations. Agriculture has made the major contribution to growth, while the performance of organised industry has been most disappointing. The services sector, particularly 'banking and insurance' and 'public administration and defence', has experienced faster growth than the commodity producing sectors. In agriculture, while the sources of growth have changed over time, the overall rate of growth has failed to get accelerated because the impact of the new agricultural strategy has been restricted to a few crops and to a few regions and even this impact has begun to get exhausted. Production of pulses and coarse grains have suffered the most. Inter-regional and inter-class disparities in rural income and asset distribution have got vastly accentuated. In industry, the basic and capital goods sectors have suffered and, more importantly, the production of mass consumption goods has lagged behind. The growth of non-farm employment has been most tardy. This, together with a higher rate of inflation, reduced per capita availability of wage goods and widening inequality of incomes and assets, makes it almost certain that the proportion of people below the 'poverty line' has risen instead of declining. The primary cause of this structural retrogression of the Indian economy is the decline of planning. Saving and investment efforts, particularly in the public sector, were curtailed, public sector Plan outlays were initially slashed and thereafter their growth has been drastically curtailed, funds for the maintenance of past Plan projects have not been allocated adequately, resource mobilisation efforts have been both inadequate and inequitous, deficit financing has been resorted to discriminately and, finally, a significant proportion of public sector outlays has been frittered away in non-development expenditure in the form of subsidies and transfers to state governments for such purposes as drought relief, clearance of overdrafts, etc. The poor performance of the public sector has had its effects on private sector output, employment and investment. Private sector investment, though it has not done badly, has been mainly financed by public financial institutions. But despite enormous amounts of public funds being made available to the private sector, there has hardly been any worthwhile impact on the investment climate or on growth of employment. This has happened because the funds have been expanded on more capital-intensive projects and also siphoned off by the promoters of projects by inflating project costs and engineering cost overruns, activities which have been encouraged by the relaxation of government controls, by the general atmosphere of financial indiscipline in the government and private sectors and by the liberal availability of public funds at low cost.||S.

Herein lies the complexity of the challenge of implementation of land reforms. The restructuring of the administrative system can open a new chapter in land reforms implementation if the process of restructuring becomes a process of decisively shifting the power base of the political system froth the rural rich to the rural poor and if the rural poor are themselves involved in this process of changing the power balance in the countryside. A beginning can be made in this direction by giving a decisive role in formulating land reform schemes and their implementation to rural-poor oriented Land Commissions at the Centre and in the states and to village Level Committees in which the rural poor have a substantial representation.||P C Joshi

27/5/1978- ||special articles||4366665||Agrarian Legislation and Social Classes: A Case Study of Malabar||During the second half of the 19th century recurrent peasant revolts drew the attention of the British colonial rulers to the immediate political necessity of allaying the mounting discontent among the peasantry. However, the legislative attempts in this direction, though initiated with an avowed concern for the condition of the peasantry, remained half measures and, therefore, failed to afford protection to the cultivating tenants from the evils of landlordism and usury. To understand why this happened, an analysis of the dominant social classes who exerted pressure and influence during the process of legislation becomes crucial. This paper is concerned with an examination of this problem in connection with agrarian legislation in Malabar in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.||K. N. Panikkar
26/8/1978- ||special articles||4366898||Multinational Firms and Export Processing Zones||The central idea behind the setting up of Export Promotion Zones (EPZs) in underdeveloped countries is to motivate multinational corperations (MNCs), through the offer of a variety of incentives and concessions, to set up facilities for labour-intensive manufacture or assembling for export back to their home markets or to other world markets. The presumption is that the operation of the MNCs will result in employment and income generation in the underdeveloped country and enlarge its export earnings. The study of the Santa Cruz Electronics Export Promotion Zone (SEEPZ) attempted in this paper shows that the operations of the MNCs have not achieved the expected results. First, the overall production and exports, as well as the proportion of value added, by units in the SEEPZ have been far below the targets. Second, the proportion of value added has varied inversely with the degree of foreign control, with Indian-owned units using Indian technology performing far better than units controlled by the MNCs.||K.

18/11/1978- ||special articles||4367105||Role of China in International Relations||The complex role that is presently being played by China in international relations has its roots deeply imbedded in Chinese history. Throughout this history, a great deal of importance was attached to China's relationship with the rest of the world; but it was not until the revolutionary movement launched by the Chinese Communist Party in the 1920s that attention was given to the question of the inter-relationship between the construction of socialism in China and the role of China in international relations. This paper seeks to set out various aspects of this inter-relationship since 1949 when the Chinese revolution achieved its final victory. The paper is in three parts: Part I, which was published last week, presented a broad historical survey of the development of China's foreign policy. Part II, being published now, is devoted to specific aspects of China's role in international relations before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Part III, which takes up the theme since the Cultural Revolution, will be published next week.||T. V. Satyamurthy

The extent of this control is symptomatic of the entire spectrum of primary commodity markets, seen in leaf tobacco, bananas and cocoa, to cite but three commodities. This paper examines the critical inter-connections between the traders, the commodity exchanges where prices are formed, and national marketing institutions in cotton producing nations.||Frederick Clairmonte,John Cavanagh

17/6/1978- ||special articles||4366726||Class Relations in Indian Agriculture: III||The author, in the course of this article, develops and presents a thesis regarding the class composition of the Indian agricultural population. The thesis is that there are only two classes in Indian agriculture, one of which is termed 'the class of big landowners' and the other 'the class of agricultural labourers'. These two classes are in antagonistic contradiction with each other, and this contradiction constitutes the principal contradiction in our rural society. The thesis implies rejection of the commonly accepted class differentiation in terms of agricultural labourers, poor peasants, middle peasants, rich peasants, landlords, etc. While recognising that this scheme is sanctified because of its formulation and application by Lenin and Mao Tse-tung, the author argues that the scheme is not helpful when it comes to Indian conditions. By 'helpful' is meant helpful from the point of view of practice. In this, the author's idea is the fundamental Marxian thought that the only test of the correctness of theories and the usefulness of concepts lies in their application in practice. The article is being published in three parts. In the first and second parts, already published, the author discussed the concept of the mode of production and certain features of capitalist and feudal relations. This, the concluding part of the paper, presents the author's views on the ruling class in Indian agriculture.||Ashok Rudra

The salient features of the picture that emerges are: (a) inter-state distribution of institutional finance has had a very pronounced regressive bias against low-income states and in favour of high-income states; (b) bank finance and term-lending to industry were largely responsible for this regressiveness; and (c) because of this, the bias in inter-state distribution of budgetary transfers in favour of the middle-income states, as a group, has been wiped out, so that the overall inter-state distribution of total finance has operated clearly to the benefit of high-income states. To the extent that the distribution of institutional finance is regressive, the onus on Central budgetary transfers for reallocation of resources among the states becomes greater. The larger the role of Central budgetary transfers for bringing about equitable inter-state distribution of resources, the greater will have to be the role of a statutory body like the Finance Commission. Of course, if the Finance Commission chooses to abdicate its redistributive role - as most of the Commissions so far have done - other ways and means will have to be devised. But the present state of gross inequity cannot continue for long.||I. S. Gulati,K. K. George

An attempt is made here to suggest a reshaping of personal income taxation with the objective of encouraging savings. While the suggested scheme of taxation may not reduce inequality of post-tax incomes, it will certainly help reduce inequality of consumption.||M. P. Chitale

An attempt is made towards the end to analyse the implications of this debate for development planning in India.||Biplab Dasgupta

This account, the result of the author's fieldwork in and around Bardoli taluka in Gujarat during February-June 1977 and part of a more extensive study of migratory labour in South Gujarat, examines the intra-rural circulation and the seasonal movement of landless labourers and small peasants, mostly from the Khandesh in western Maharashtra, to sugar factories in the vicinity of Bardoli. Describing in detail the beginnings of sugarcane cultivation in South Gujarat and the organisation of sugar co-operatives, the highly organised methods of recruitment of migrant labour from western Maharashtra, the conditions in which the migrant labourers live and work, the author shows that this type of seasonal migration is most closely bound up with the capitalist development of rural production in this area - a process in which the organisation of the dominant class of farmers into agricultural co-operatives has played an important part.||Jan Breman

This continuing dominance of agriculture in the rural occupational structure can be explained first, by the weak linkages between the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors and, secondly, by the lack of resilience on the part of such village industries as do exist to meet the demands of the more affluent sections of the peasantry. This paper examines the prospects for expansion of employment in agriculture and rural industry. Even if there were to be a deliberate 'social' intervention in favour of allocating larger resources to agriculture, the labour absorption capacity of Indian agriculture would be limited; and the path of rapid rural industrialisation too is beset with many pitfalls. These problems, and certain deliberate policy decisions - creation of physical and social infrastructures, changes in the present rural credit and pricing policies, etc - that need to be taken to make a dent on rural unemployment are discussed in the concluding section.||V.

However, this rise has been contributed to largely by projects in the joint sector. Based on the projects sanctioned until the end of 1977, the capital expenditures in 1978 will be Rs 735 crores. If we add to this the likely expenditures to be incurred on projects to be sanctioned in 1978, the total capital expenditures in the corporate sector in 1978 should rise above the 1977 level by 5 to 8 per cent.||C.

Especially in food production the country has overcome 'scarcity'. A number of administrative, technological, social and structural innovations have resulted in this situation. There is also a stability in agriculture which can make it withstand weather variations. Full exploitation of the irrigation potential and of input possibilities should enable the country to achieve the targets it has set before it. The economy needs to equip itself to absorb this agricultural development. Policy instruments, of marketing and credit, prices, extension, and export and import, need to be fashioned to utilise the emerging surpluses.||G. V. K. Rao,R. Thamarajakshi

The option to convert loans into equity was supposed to be exercised by these institutions two or three years after the implementation of the project. Most of these institutions are thus in the process of exercising this option at present. This study is designed to analyse the experience of the financial institutions with respect to the (i) stipulation of the convertibility option and (ii) decision criteria used for the exercise of options and related problems. An attempt is also made to suggest alternative decision criteria which can incorporate risk and uncertainty involved in decisions to convert or not to convert in case of profitable and loss-making companies at the time of decision-making.||U.

At the same time, he is not willing to put in the necessary effort to build a viable union movement nor even a stable plant union. Despite low union participation, however, the workers' occupational interests appear to be taken care of. This is made possible by the availability of outside professionals and national parties that are always ready to step in and carry out all the necessary work connected with formation and running of unions. This arrangement apparently suits the worker for, besides saving him time and effort, it minimises the risk of victimisation at the hands of employers. To ensure that the unions dominated by outsiders do in fact safeguard the occupational interests of the workers, the latter wield the ultimate power, which they often use, of leaving one union and joining another. They are in a position to do so because of the prevailing multiplicity of unions, which is encouraged by the competing interests of outside leaders, the existing labour legislation and the unenlightened attitudes and actions of certain managements. The multiplicity of unions seems to suit the worker too. Through a long process of trial and error, the workers and the outside leaders seem to have worked out an arrangement which is mutually beneficial and is at the same time well within the existing legal framework.||Baldev R.

This paper, which explores data from two rice-producing regions of Kerala, attempts to show how the first two goals of larger food production are essentially incompatible under the present social relations of production.||Joan P.

The political elite in these countries have been forced to come to terms with certain fundamental and grim realities of the economic situation, the most important being the continuing population pressure on land and the absence of any prospect of a sizeable population transfer from agriculture to non-agriculture in the foreseeable future. The recognition of these realities is forcing a break from past patterns of thought which were biased in favour of industrialisation as the answer to the acute problem of man-land imbalance in agriculture. In sharp contrast to the pro-industrialisation orientation of the past, the current thinking of the ruling elite has shifted in favour of seeking ways and means to enlarge employment in the rural sector itself. This shift of focus, from the urban to the rural and from the industrial to the agriculture sector, has raised not only the question of redefining the relation between an industrial and an agricultural revolution, it has also imparted urgency to the need for evolving an agrarian organisational pattern for a landhungry population that is most conducive to maximising employment within the rural sector.||P.

23/9/1978- ||special article||4366981||Agricultural Holdings Tax: A Modified Scheme||In the interests of both revenue as well as equity, the system of taxation of agriculture in India needs to be overhauled. A tax based on an index that reflects the productivity of land on an average, after making reasonable allowance for differences in soil and climate, is needed. The agricultural holdings tax (AHT) proposed by the Raj Committee was intended to provide a model for such a tax. This paper attempts to show that it is possible to modify the scheme of AHT to make it administratively simpler while retaining its essential character. The author argues that even with moderately graduated rates, the yield from a modified AHT would be substantially higher than that from land revenue including cesses and surcharges.||Amaresh Bagchi

Not so unexpected has been the short-lived nature of the subsequent euphoria. Compared to the proverbial timelessness of India, things have been happening rather fast on the political scene and not all the dramatic twists and turns fall in line with some of our pre-conceived theorising about the polity. The present article is both an analysis of the past and a prognosis: it analyses the political and economic factors that led to the crisis whose most explicit manifestation was the Emergency; and it foresees that given the Indian reality, political democracy, even if it survives is likely to be highly unstable.||Pranab Bardhan

The analysis of the data indicates that while both the revenues and the expenditures have been almost consistently underestimated, the extent of error for expenditures has been much greater. This implies that the actual impact of the budget has generally been more expansionary than the planned impact. While the above indicates a need to increase the technical sophistication of the forecasting process, it has wider implications not only for stablisation policy but also for the credibility of the political process and for the strategy of planned development itself.||Mukul G.

Mao Tse-tung further developed Lenin's thesis and summed up the experience of the Chinese revolution: even though its immediate tasks are bourgeois-democratic, the revolution in semi-colonies can no longer be led by the bourgeoisie; instead it must be a new democratic revolution under the leadership of the working class. The experience of the revolution of 1974 in Ethiopia once again confirms this thesis. In the era of imperialism and social imperialism, none but the working class can guarantee democracy for the people.||

10/6/1978- ||special articles||4366706||Class Relations in Indian Agriculture: II||The author, in the course of this article, develops and presents a thesis regarding the class composition of the Indian agricultural population. The thesis is that there are only two classes in Indian agriculture, one of which is termed 'the class of big landowners', the other 'the class of agricultural labourers'. These two classes are in antagonistic contradiction with each other, and this contradiction constitutes the principal contradiction in our rural society. The thesis implies rejection of the commonly accepted class differentiation in terms of agricultural labourers, poor peasants, middle peasants, rich peasants, landlords, etc. While recognising that this scheme is sanctified because of its formulation and application by Lenin and Mao Tse-tung, the author argues that the scheme is not helpful when it comes to Indian conditions. By 'helpful' is meant helpful from the point of view of practice. In this, the author's idea is the fundamental Marxian thought that the only test of the correctness of theories and the usefulness of concepts lies in their application in practice. The article is being published in three parts. The first part, published last week, considered the concept of the mode of production and certain features of capitalist relations. In this, the second part, the author discusses some features of feudal relations. The concluding part of the paper will present the author's views on the ruling class in Indian agriculture.||Ashok Rudra
25/11/1978- ||special articles||4367132||Role of China in International Relations||The complex role that is presently being played by China in international relations has its roots deeply imbedded in Chinese history. Throughout this history, a great deal of importance was attached to China's relationship with the rest of the world; but it was not until the revolutionary movement launched by the Chinese Communist Party in the 1920s that attention was given to the question of the inter-relationship between the construction of socialism in China and the role of China in international relations. This paper seeks to set out various aspects of this inter-relationship since 1949 when the Chinese revolution achieved its final victory. The paper is in three parts: Parts I and II which have been already published, presented a broad historical survey of the development of China's foreign policy and specific aspects of China's role in international relations before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Part III, in this issue, takes up the theme since the Cultural Revolution.||T. V. Satyamurthy

02/9/1978- ||special articles||4366921||Indian Capitalist Class and Congress on National Planning and Public Sector 1930-47||A false dichotomy has been created in much of our historical and political analysis between the economic programme put forward by the Indian capitalist class and left nationalists like Nehru and K T Shah in the period between 1930 and 1947. The formers is often seen as having been 'collaborationist' or 'compradore', while the latter are seen to have stood for a social structure entirely different from that envisaged by the capitalists. This paper examines the ideas put forward by the Indian capitalist class and the Congress on issues such as economic planning and the role of the State in it to question the above hypotheses and to argue that pre-independence planning exercises, whether done by the capitalists or the radical left national leadership, made two common basic assumptions: first, the overthrow of the colonial state structure; and, second, its replacement by an independent indigenous capitalist state structure.||A.

Its findings are that despite the professed aim of these Programmes to democratise the whole work process, their actual impact has been to make the hierarchical divisions more rigid. The phenomenon of elitism so characteristic of management culture, while masquerading under the garb of democratisation, is indeed doing very well.||Jai B. P. Sinha

There has even been an explicit recognition of the need to mobilise the rural poor and the Draft Plan, 1978-83, pointedly speaks of the need for the poor to be organised for the success of redistributive laws, policies and programmes. This article seeks to trace the background to some micro experiments in the organisation of the rural poor and attempts to outline the basic principles around which such actions should revolve. It attempts to define some of the limits to such experiments in order to prevent them from mushrooming into large bureaucratic structures.||Harsh Sethi

In Section I it is shown that promoting employment through greater labour-intensity of technique would involve taxation of profits and possibly some decrease in private investment. In Section II the authors try to reconcile this result with some known arguments which do not imply a reduction in investment and contend that the assumptions underlying these arguments are not very descriptive of our economy. Finally, in Section III, the authors comment on the adequacy of the government's policy for achieving employment generation, given their results.||S. K. Rao,Amal Sanyal

It has taken the view that the framework of Centre-state financial relations embodied in the Constitution has stood the test of time and has worked fairly and smoothly. It is questionable, however, that the system has worked fairly in relation to the resource needs of the poorer states. Likewise, while the system has functioned smoothly in that it has not created breakdowns, the duality of agencies, namely, the Planning Commission and the Finance Commission, has made it complex in functioning. Moreover, one cannot say with confidence that the existing system of Centre-state financial relations has succeeded in ensuring efficiency in expenditure.

The excess of domestic saving over investment and the comfortable foreign exchange position would suggest that the bottleneck does not lie in the paucity of investible funds, domestic or foreign exchange, for the economy as a whole. Nor does the danger of a runaway price rise appear to restrain investment. Even so, whether the budget will succeed in giving a fresh impetus to investment is an open question. The chances are less than even.||

This paper provides some quantitative dimensions for some of these employment and unemployment characteristics of rural women. The analysis is based on some special tabulations carried out by the author on data for about 4,900 sample households from over 500 sample villages in West Bengal collected by the NSS in its 1972-73 employment and unemployment survey.||Pranab Bardhan

22/7/1978- ||special articles||4366831||Tobacco Development and Labour Migration: Planning for Labour Welfare and Development||Tobacco development demands a large supply of labour having new skills. The labourers who have already acquired such skills in other areas move to the new areas of development. The present paper, based on field work, examines one such situation regarding the introduction of light soil Flue Cured Virginia Tobacco in the West Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. The author discusses the various operational activities connected with tobacco cultivation and the kind of skills required on the part of the labourers. In the absence of adequate supply of skilled labourers in this area, they are imported from areas where there is already an established tradition of tobacco cultivation, and where tobacco cultivation has declined. This stream of migration which tends to be job specific is discussed in detail. The part played by government agencies and certain companies in the development of tobacco farming has been significant. While the farmers get easy credit, fertilisers, technical help and marketing facility, the labourers are left to themselves. Wage rates are low, the camping labourers live in miserable conditions, medical facilities are poor and inaccessible and and there are no educational opportunities for the children who migrate along with the parents. There is no voluntary organisation or union which organises labour for a better deal.

No one has, however, questioned the validity of the methods used for evaluating the real magnitude of the food and poverty problems to see if in fact malnutrition linked with poverty is as massive as it is claimed to be. An uncritical acceptance of the methodology used and of the estimates based thereon as a basis for remedial measures is bound to lead to imbalance in the use of limited resources. It is, therefore, important that we give careful consideration to the methods used in evaluating the current situation before developing the elements of the new strategy to combat malnutrition and poverty. This is the task attempted in this paper.||P. V. Sukhatme

14/1/1978- ||special articles||4366292||Inflation and Distribution of Income||This paper studies the changes in distribution of national income and in consumption expenditures by different sections of the population in an inflationary context. Inflation in India, the author concludes, has hurt mainly the poor. Given their levels of poverty, even marginal falls in their consumption are of serious consequence. Among the poor, the unorganised sections of labour, both in the rural and the urban areas, have been the worst affected, lacking adequate means for protection against inflation. Even the public distribution system affords only partial protection to the urban poor. The middle classes in urban areas have been able to secure some protection against inflation and the rural middle classes have benefited to a certain extent from favourable price movements for agriculture. These price movements have brought substantial gains to the rich peasants who, along with traders, have been the principal beneficiaries of the inflation in India.||Sridhar Krishna

It finds that while as a rule the decision makers at the national level reflect a social background different from that of the population which they represent, this contradiction is less evident as far as the scheduled caste members of the earlier Lok Sabha is concerned. But over a period, the scheduled caste members have begun to acquire all the characteristic of the general members of the Lok Sabha. This, to an extent, indicates the emerging homogeneity among the Indian political elite.||G. Narayana

11/3/1978- ||special articles||4366423||The Union Budget||The 1978-79 Union Budget provides for a smaller increase in Plan outlay, in absolute amount as well as in percentage terms, than the Budget for 1977-78, in spite of a much larger tax effort, a higher level of external assistance and a larger deficit. The most distinguishing aspect of the tax effort proposed in the Budget is that over 90 per cent of the additional tax revenue will be raised from taxes on commodities. What is more, the Finance Minister makes no distinction between essential and inessential items on the ground that to do so would be to create "fresh distortions in the tax structure". The Finance Minister has also ignored the Jha Committee's recommendations in proposing specific excises on electricity and coal. A more general misgiving about the approach of the Finance Minister is that he is either not concerned about generating additional employment in industry or has come to the conclusion that the larger the investment in plant and equipment in an enterprise, the greater its ability to generate the employment. This apprehension stems from a number of specific proposals contained in the Budget. While the withdrawal of the export market development allowance is welcome, why should the government continue to give away something like Rs 500 crores annually by way of export subsidies in various forms? One major modification of the tax laws that is not even mentioned in the Budget speech is the restoration of various deductions allowed to the Hindu Undivided Family having one or more members with independent taxable income. This clearly marks the reversal of the very slow process of closing the HUF loophole for tax avoidance.||I. S. Gulati
07/10/1978- ||special article||4367003||Autonomy and Participation: Dimensions of Indian Muslim Identity||The present paper deals with the role of Muslims in India, with the problems of their identity and autonomy, as also the interconnection of their interest and that of the nation of which they form a vital part. India is a sort of multiple federation, a federation of regions, cultures, communities, castes, classes, ideologies and so on - superimposed as well as cutting across one another. In such a complex polity Muslims must belong to a multiplicity of identities at vertical and horizontal levels, exclusive as well as in partnership with others, in order to maintain their identity and play an effective and constructive role, in peace with other communities of India, as also to satisfy their own multiple urges.||Balraj Puri

The more recent Soviet resort to, and justification of, advertising is quoted in amplification. However, advertising needs greater professionalisation, greater education, and ethical self-regulation. If advertisers get their due recognition, the author argues, there is a reasonable chance that advertising in India will be attuned to national goals.||K. Kurian

It is also effective in the Japanese situation, as the popularity of the quality control circles movement indicates. In the Indian context, concern for organisational stability may generate forces of resistance to environmentally desirable change. Development of a collective strategy for organisational change could be facilitated, provided the strategy does not clash with the predominant values. We still do not possess adequate insight into the predominant cultural characteristics of the administrative-managerial groups in Third World countries like India. The situation is still somewhat blurred and there is rapidity of change. Secondly, we still do not have a clear picture of how managerial values get socialised in an organisation system and to what extent technology influences the values of the managers. Having admitted these limitations and gaps in our knowledge, we can still make the proposition that cultural relativity reflected in managerial values would be an important parameter in the organisational change process - particularly in determining the training needs of managers to become change agents in revitalising organisations.||Nitish R.

The modified form of funding suggested in this paper seeks to eliminate the anamolies of the 'dual' treasury bill system and to make treasury bill financing a meaningful and self-liquidating arrangement rather than treat it as a mere source of short-cum-long-term borrowing for the government.||T.

Occasionally, surpluses too have existed. In these circumstances, there is need for flexibility in planning. Recently, the rolling plan has been proposed to provide such flexibility. In this paper, we have examined the conditions needing replanning. Unless there is to be a change in the objective, an alternative approach for replanning is proposed which strives to maintain the priorities implicit in the original plan. Planners should strive not only for measures which will bring the actual output close to the planned levels but also refix the targets set for the various sectors taking inter-sectoral consistency into account. In this paper, we have provided mathematical programming formulations that will help planners to reset targets in this way. The new set of output targets would vary depending on whether the objective is to remain as close as possible to the original vector of final demand or to the original levels of sectorwise employment, since our illustrative exercise shows that there is a trade-off between employment and income which the planners must consciously choose.||C.

28/10/1978- ||special article||4367065||Who Are the Other Backward Classes?: An Introduction to a Constitutional Puzzle||In view of the recent upsurge of interest in Other Backward Classes, it may be timely to reflect on how this term became a category for public policy in India and what its possible meaning is. The question of who were the Scheduled Castes was debated and roughly settled before Independence within the executive and without the participation of the courts. But who are the Backward Classes is a post-Independence question which the constitutional recognition of the category made one of all-India scope. The Corstitution left the matter with the executive at the state level with an option for the Centre to unify it. When the executive at the Centre first failed and then declined to provide a resolution, the question reverted to the states. In the wake of the Janata victory in the 1977 elections, the Backward Classes returned to the national political agenda. Pursuant to its electoral promise, the Janata government appeared poised to appoint a new Backward Classes Commission, but had not done so by mid-1978. The UP and Bihar governments, under Janata control, enlarged substantially the preferences for Other Backward Classes, leading to massive violence in Bihar and political intervention by the Centre. During the hiatus of Central involvement, what the states did was increasingly subjected to the examination of the courts. It has been the Supreme Court rather than the Central government which has been the unifying and limiting influence and presumably any new Central policy will be shaped in the light of two decades of judicial predominance in this area.||Marc Galanter

This paper examines the failure of health planning in India. While the more obvious causes for this failure might be the incompetence or poor judgment of the planners and administrators, the real causes lie in the value system of the political leadership which habitually mouths egalitarian pronouncements while pursuing policies which are entirely elitist.||D.

But their responsibility does not end with such opposition. They have long complained also against the existing legislation, and have demanded basic changes in labour laws. Now that the issue is squarely joined, trade union bodies, while opposing the IR Bill, 1978, have the responsibility of outlining, in clear and practical terms, their own approach to the question of regulation of industrial relations and the alternative model legislation which they would like to be enacted. Such an approach and model must not only be equitable and just; it must also be seen to be such by the society at large.||Bagaram Tulpule

The sources of high administrative costs are then identified. And, finally, a strategy is proposed for reducing these high costs. These objectives are discussed mainly in conceptual terms. Wherever possible, the available costs data are also used for empirical validation of analytical arguments. However, in India, these data are not yet adequately documented. Nor are the experience of the group or area approach to agricultural financing adequately studied.||B. M. Desai
