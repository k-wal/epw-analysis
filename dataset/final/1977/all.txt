10/12/1977- ||special articles||4366180||Illegal Transactions in External Trade and Payments in India: An Empirical Study||Using the partner-country data comparison technique to detect faked invoicing of imports and exports, the author finds that during the period 1961 to 1971 (i) There was a greater tendency to underinvoice imports than to overinvoice them. The extent of underinvoicing during the period under study varied from $ 54 to $ 332 million. High rates of import duty which exceeded the premium on foreign exchange in the illegal exchange market were the primary reason for the emergence of the phenomenon of underinvoicing of imports. (ii) The tendency to underinvoice exports was substantially more than that to overinvoice them. The magnitude of underinvoicing of exports during this period varied between $ 67 and $ 167 million. The author's estimates of the extent of smuggling of goods show an increase from Rs 51 crores in 1961 to Rs 450 crores in 1974. The ratio of goods smuggled to official imports thus rose from 5 per cent to 10 per cent during this period. The total demand for illegal foreign exchange on account of smuggling of goods and import/export invoice manipulations showed an increase from Rs 96 crores in 1962 to Rs 720 crores in 1974. The emergence of the regime of floating exchange rates has led to a substantial reduction of overvaluation of the Indian rupee and the premium on foreign exchange in the illegal market. The premium which had increased from 50 per cent in 1961-62 to 99 per cent in 1965-66, came down to 48 per cent in 1966-67 and further to 14 per cent in 1973-74.||Satyendra S. Nayak

Despite a decrease in the extent of landlessness, the weightage of small owner-operators operating the bottom 20 per cent of land has decreased from 69 per cent to 57 per cent between 1954-55 and 1971-72; while that of the large owner-operators operating the top 20 per cent of area has increased from 4 per cent to 6 per cent. In the bottom group of holdings, those cultivated by landless cultivators fell from 28 per cent in 1954-55 to 4 per cent in 1971-72. On the other hand, the percentage of entirely leased-in holdings in the top groups has increased from 1 to 3 per cent. There seems to have been a change in the preference of the lessors in favour of large rather than small operators. The pressure of population on land continues nevertheless. But this has resulted not in an increase of landless bargadars but in an alarming increase of rural proletariat employed as casual labourers or not employed at all. And this is despite (or perhaps because of) the technological development that has taken place during this period.||Kalyan Dutt

1/8/1977- ||political economy of energy policy||4365858||Technological Alternatives and the Indian Energy Crisis||In a country like India where income inequalities are also reflected as inequalities of per capita energy consumption, the new energy crisis mainly threatens the consumption-oriented lifestyle of an energy-affluent elite and has far less impact on the rural poor. These, condemned to survive on 'zero' private cost non-commercial energy, have been in the grip of a grave energy crisis from a period long before the 'new' energy crisis began. The energy-calamity that has overtaken the elite provides an excellent opportunity to review the whole Indian energy situation and seek alternatives compatible with the resource constraints, which would result in a more equitable pattern of energy consumption. This paper traces the origins of the recent energy crisis and presents a detailed diagnosis. Apart from detailed suggestions regarding the conservation of oil as well as more intensive use of coal, hydel power and non-commercial energy sources, the study specifically examines the possibilities and limitations of three main alternative energy sources: solar energy, bio-gas and wind energy. There is also a brief discussion of possible improvements in the utilisation of human and animal energies. Some specific and detailed suggestions regarding the distribution of available energy among the urban and rural population are made. It is calculated that an increase by 4.4 times of the total commercial and non-commercial energy production in 1971 in India will ensure the entire Indian population a reasonable energy consumption. This increase must be reached by a strategy of discriminatory and biased increases, so that the energy consumption of the deprived and affluent sections is increased by factors of 5 and 2.5 respectively. Such increases require a mix of decentralised and centralised energy production, the former being more relevant to the rural areas. The study concludes that the energy crisis of the affluent is not a people's problem and the real energy crisis experienced by the poor can be tackled with alternative approaches.||Amulya Kumar N.

The major finding of this study is that there is a widespread practice of mortgaging ration cards in the community; that such mortages are made mostly by households belonging to scheduled castes; that among the households covered by the study, the ones with the lowest per capita daily consumption of cereals or cereal substitutes are precisely those that mortgage their ration cards.||Leela Gulati

Corporate investment in 1977 would be higher than in 1976. It is likely to reach in nominal terms the level attained in 1974, which is the best year so far. However, in real terms the 1974 peak will not be reached. This study entailed an analysis of all the projects sanctioned by the all-India term lending institutions. Capital expenditures incurred on all projects sanctioned by these institutions amounted to Rs 530 crores in 1975. But during 1976 these expenditures are likely to be Rs 637 crores, thus indicating a pick-up in corporate investment. Since as of now the capital expenditures likely to be incurred in 1977 are of the order of Rs 512 crores there is every possibility that corporate investment in 1977 would exceed the level reached in 1976. A higher level of corporate investment in current prices does not, however, indicate a rise in investment in real terms.||C. Rangarajan

The stated purpose of the Commission is "to develop practical proposals for joint action" on issues such as energy, relations with the third world, international finance and governability at home. Carter was a member since its inception; so was Walter Mondale, Carter's Vice-President. Zbigniew Brzezinski, Carter's National Security Advisor, was its Director, and Cyrus Vance, the Secretary of State, Harold Brown, the Secretary of Defence and W Michael Blumenthal, Secretary of Trasury were members. At least nine other members of the Commission have been appointed to high office, including Paul Warnke, recently confirmed to head the US Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, and Andrew Young, US Representative at the United Nations. Clearly, members of the Trilateral Commission dominate the Executive branch of the United States government. What does this mean? First of all, what is the Trilateral Commission? What is the nature of its link with Carter, and with his administration? What positions has the Commission taken on international and domestic issues? How likely is Carter to adhere to these policies, and how much does his Trilateral connection tell us about his future actions? This article attempts to answer some of these questions.||Jay Peterzell

12/3/1977- ||special articles||4365396||Emergence of Permanent Emergency in India||This paper argues that the most important causes and consequences of 'Emergency Rule' in India should be sought and can be found in the depending accumulation crisis in Indian industry (and in the capitalist world generally) since the mid-1960s and in the measures taken by Indian (and foreign) capital to confront this crisis. The suggestion is that the actions of the government of India represent essentially the political-economic needs and interests of big industrial capital in what is primarily an inter-class struggle and that Indira Gandhi's intra-class conflict with her rivals turns on the secondary question of who will execute essentially the same capitalist policy and how. Any government of capitalist India that emerges from the present political crisis will necessarily (have to) pursue the same political-economic policy for the foreseeable future of the permanent Emergency.||Andre Gunder Frank

This article tries, against this background, to raise some issues in regard to industrial policy and the related aspect of rural development as an alternative source of gainful employment.||

A Critique of Kuldip Nayar Committee's Report||The Kuldip Nayar Committee's report provides no help in coming to useful decisions about the future of Samachar. Contrary to the Committee's basic premise, competition does not ensure freedom, nor even efficiency. Besides, the financial resources that can be organised cannot sustain three different agencies as recommended by the Committee. The Committee has failed to go deeply into the desirability of ensuring financial independence to the news agencies. On the contrary, it suggests greater reliance on government funds. The development of language services must receive due attention and government subsidy for this purpose, for a limited period and on a tapering basis, is necessary and in order. The continued membership of the non-aligned newspool is of no benefit. If participation in the pool is found necessary for foreign policy reasons, then the responsibility for this should be vested in the government.||C. G. K. Reddy

The credit for this seeming emancipation has too often gone to men. In fact, however, the gains in public life enjoyed by Indian women were hard fought for and won by women themselves. The women's movement which gathered strength from the 1920s culminated in the legislation of 1956. Unfortunately, in more recent decades, Indian women have too readily yielded their responsibility for preserving and enlarging their rights to institutions of State and society. The effect of this is seen in the overall decline in their participation in public life. It is very clear that there is need to revive the women's movement if women are to achieve genuine equality as citizens and are not to become one of the several casualties of the declining developmental process.||Shahida Lateef

03/9/1977- ||special articles||4365904||Reflections on the Future of Family Planning||The analysis of family planning activities in rural Uttar Pradesh, in terms of four analytical constructs, suggests a consistent gap between plan and performance both at the level of interaction with the client population and at the level of organising. This gap has existed both before 1975 and during the emergency period. This paper argues that the following three guidelines are of crucial importance in discussing future courses of action for family planning. These are: (1) the strategy chosen for client transactions has to be suited to the client population; (2) the organising strategy has to be suited to the client strategy; and (3) the organising strategy has to be suited to the institutional context within which it is implemented. It is relatively easy to define a client strategy that should work in theory but can not be implemented by the existing structures. Similarly, it is possible to have an organisation which is well designed but inappropriate to the family planning task. The difficult task, then, is to find a set of strategies that suit both the client needs and the constraints of the organisation. This paper suggests three future courses of action in family planning - viz, restructuring the external environment; marginal alterations of programme organisation; and ways to reduce the burden of organising.||B.

18/6/1977- ||special articles||4365702||The Political Economy of Fascism||Fascism is a concept that is used more as a pejorative term than one having a rigorous theoretical connotation. The unprincipled flogging of the term, and a failure to come to grips with its cultural and structural significance has frequently brought Left forces to grief. What is still more lacking is a scientific theory of fascism. This article attempts to present such a theory by sorting out the structural features of the social and economic co-ordinates of fascism from the more popular value-laden cultural connotations. Though the bulk of the discussion pertains, necessarily, to developments in the advanced capitalist countries in the West, the last section of the paper attempts to relate the issue to developments in Third World countries, particularly India.||Dipankar Gupta

2/7/1977- ||special articles||41497079||Rural Employment, Wages and Labour Markets in India: A Survey of Research — II||This survey, of empirical work on the rural labour market is divided into three sections. Section I surveys the literature on size, characteristics and composition of the rural working force and employment, particularly the changes over time. Changes in the composition of rural work participation and in the distribution of employment, viewed together with the pattern of migration, would indicate at the macro level, adjustments of labour supply to changing income-earning opportunities. Section II covers studies on labour demand implications of agricultural growth with technological change, focusing on the respective employment effects of the seed-water-fertiliser innovation and of the tractor technology depending on the composition of its operational uses. With an eye to the labour demand effects of the changes in scale of production, technology, and related changes in the nature of tenancy and other agrarian institutions, the author discusses studies on employment and wage rates for agricultural labourers, on changes in labours share of value added, and on the board correlates of regional and/or intertemporal variation in wage rates. Section III is concerned more exclusively with the relatively /small amount of literature relating to the process of rural wage determination, the allocation of household labour supply and. of demand for farm labour by the source of supply. The issue of seasonality is discussed more directly in this context. The various implications of institutional differences in the modes of wage payment, labour contracts, and the nature of land (lease) markets are also considered in some details there. This paper is being published in three parts. Section I appeared in the Review of Agriculture last week and Section III will be published next week.||Kalpana Bardhan

27/8/1977- ||review of management, august 1977||4365875||Industrial Labour in Developing Economies: A Critique of the Labour Commitment Theory||Through the concentrated and co-ordinated efforts of some of the more prominent economists, sociologists, anthropologists and political scientists of the United States has emerged a theory on the labour 'problems' in the industrialisation of the newly developing areas of the world: the theory of 'labour commitment'. This theory was formally launched by a background paper, prepared by Arnold S Feldman and Wilbert E'Moore, at a conference held in Chicago, 1958. Since then, the theory has received wide circulation, including in India. The present article attempts to develop a critique of the labour commitment theory. The article develops along the following plan. First, an exposition of the theory is reconstructed from the writings of the proponents of the theory (Sections I and II), followed by an exposition of further contributions to the theory (Section III). Next, an attempt at presentation of the theoretical criticisms of the labour commitment theory, placed at the Chicago conference itself, is made (Section IV), supplemented by an overview of the criticism made elsewhere (Section V). The subsequent treatment (Section VI) presents empirical studies in support of the theory, which are, next, subjected to critical examination (Section VIII). Empirical studies that go contrary to the contentions of the theory are then presented (Section VIII). The author's own critique, drawing from the foregoing exercise, is finally developed in the concluding part of the article (Sections IX-XII).||Surendra Munshi

How far did this rise originate from changes in modes of production and social existence forms? Apart from the rise in the number of agricultural labourers, the importance of North Bengal as a case study stems from its overwhelmingly adhiar (share-cropper) based agricultural economy of the past. The field investigation, on which this paper is based, was carried out during the first half of 1976.||Nripendra Bandyopadhyaya

31/12/1977- ||special article||4366251||The Bourgeois State in Post-Colonial Social Formations||Two important changes have occurred since the end of the second world war which serve to characterise a different phase of imperialism. These are, first, a change in the character of the State in most third world countries from a colonial state to a politically independent bourgeois State and, second, a change in the mechanisms through which the imperialist system dominates the third world. A key factor in understanding the new situation is thus an analysis of the State, which is the purpose of this paper. The paper begins with a discussion of basic concepts (mode of production, social formation, and the State), moves on to an analysis of the capitalist State as such, and then discusses the development of imperialism and the types of States (colonial-feudal, colonial-bourgeois and politically independent bourgeois) that have been connected with imperialist domination of the world. The authors conclude with a discussion of the role of trade unions and parliament in revolutionary class struggle.||Bharat Patankar,Gail Omvedt

27/8/1977- ||special article||4365883||Planning for Rural Banks||Everything possible should be done to extend banking into the rural areas and there should not be any rigidity in the approach. There are areas in which the best line of action will be to use the co-operative primaries - either as partners of commercial banks or as individually re-structured co-operative banks. In the areas where there is little prospect for expanding and re-structuring the co-operatives, the corporate banks will have to enter in a big way. The simplest and the most effective line of action will be to increase the number of rural branches of the commercial banks. There will still remain gaps and it is for these gaps that specially sponsored rural banks will be necessary. The door should be left open for either individual sponsored banks as recommended by the Banking Commission, or for cluster banks of the type of Regional Rural Banks, with some modifications. One important modification should be to invite local participation in share capital, with a guaranteed dividend. Above all, it has to be emphasised again and again that the rural banks must provide full banking services for their customers, including medium-term lending, remittances, and ordinary safe deposit facilities. The rural customer of the banking system must not be made to feel that he is a second class citizen deserving only low grade facilities.||Bhabatosh Datta

In all too many instances such forces have led to acquisition of computers in developing countries despite the inappropriateness of such technology in many application areas. Developing countries, the author suggests, should give priority to investigating the possibilities of using minicomputers and thereby reap the potental benefit from the developments in this field. Today, close to hundred per cent of the computer requirements in developing countries are well within the range of new minicomputer systems. While there are special needs and circumstances also in developing countries requiring large-scale conventional systems, for most purposes the minicomputers do offer options which should be investigated more thoroughly than is currently the practice.||Svein Erik Nilsen

Socialist Economies in Capitalist International Division of Labour||This article, which is part of a book on the international division of labour, argues that the leadership of the socialist world has a deeply rooted tradition of trade and economic relation with the capitalist world. Following this, it is but natural that the socialist world should consider the survival and continued prosperity of capitalism as essential for its own survival. Such has been the worldview of the leadership of the socialist world, at least since the early 1920s. The ultimate aim of the socialist world is to integrate its own 'socialist' economy into a world capitalist economy. This process has been going on in one form or another in all socialist countries, though it has been most conspicuous in the Soviet Union and other East European countries. The present article documents this integration, and offers some tentative explanations for this tendency. It examines the possible consequences of this accelerating tendency towards the integration of socialist and capitalist economies to the underdeveloped countries, and to the latter's own relations with the socialist world.||Andre Gunder Frank

A ery large fraction of the poor remain outside the purview of stimulation sought to be provided by these strategies, both on the demand and on the production sides. The process of economic change works by extruding people from an active production process, and converting them into 'waste products'. These waste products can then hardly be expected to help either in raising productivity in industry and agriculture and enabling indigenous capitalists to compete with advanced capitalist countries at home and abroad, or in expanding the market in the long term and thereby raising the long-term profitability of investment. There may be other strategies for raising industrial growth and achieving self-reliance, but their discussion would require the blueprint for an alternative society as the appropriate background.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

However, India's trade agreements with these countries prior to 1958 were in the nature of convertibility currency agreements; and it was the acute foreign exchange crisis that began to be faced by the country when the Second Five-Year Plan was launched that dictated the changeover to rupee trade and payment agreements. The present article reviews the main features of India's trade with the USSR and CPEECs, and considers their likely new directions in the light of significant developments that are taking place in the country's balance of payments situation. It pleads for a return to convertibility currency trade with these countries.||R. H. Patil

15/10/1977- ||special articles||4366022||Aspects of Fiji Indian History, 1879-1939: A Society in Transition: I||Following an agreement between the colonial governments in India and Fiji, Indians were indentured to work in the sugar plantations and mills which were started in Fiji by the Australia-based Colonial Sugar Refining Company from 1879 onwards. This migration of Indian labour to Fiji went on uninterrupted till the end of 1919 when, following nationalist pressure in India, it was stopped from the beginning of 1920. The Indians in Fiji had to live and work in extremely harsh conditions; yet by far the majority of these labourers made Fiji their home, even when they had an option of being repatriated to India at the cost of the government at the end of their contracts. This article presents a historical account of the migration of Indian labourers to Fiji, the conditions of their life and work, and the impact the new environment had on the traditional attitude towards caste, religion, language, etc. It traces the gradual transformation of traditional Indian society and the growing diversification of the occupations. The major part of the paper deals with the struggles launched by the Indians for economic and political rights, including the right to adult franchise, and the attempts of the colonial government to contain these demands. The article is published in two parts. This, the first part, describes the beginnings of the migration, the life and conditions of the migrants abroad, migrant ships and coolie barracks, their attempts to come to terms with a new environment, and the first struggles launched by them. The second part of the article will be published next week.||Ahmed Ali

With this strategy not only will monopolies continue to prosper at the expense of smaller units, but stagnation in the market for industrial goods, due mainly to the rising volume and rate of unemployment, is likely to worsen. At the same time a move towards wholesale liberalisation of the economy by dismantling all sorts of controls in the spheres of industrial investment, imports and exports as recommended by the World Bank, etc, will not alter the direction of change. This paper examines the present law on monopolies and how it is being implemented. In the second part of the paper the author points out the basic limitations of the present policies. In the concluding section some alternative approaches are outlined.||N. K. Chandra

What do these proposals add up to for the developing countries? Even if these proposals do imply some gain for the developing countries, do they go far enough to meet the balance of payments difficulties which these countries are likely to face in the foreseeable future?||I.

After examining the administrative and finance mechanisms of the working of the EGS in Maharashtra, the paper argues that the EGS is a response to the conditions obtaining in the Maharashtra countryside, themselves a result of the state's history. The broad socio-economic aspects of the EGS are then examined and the shift of emphasis from village to watershed level is seen as a step in the right direction. With the co-operation of other rural development agencies and in a proper developmental framework a national EGS is seen as feasible.||Norman Reynolds,Pushpa Sundar

But when one takes an overview of the package, the principal beneficiaries of the Commission's package are four out of six states falling into the middle income group, thanks almost entirely to the revenue gap grants. The Finance Commissions must fully take the blame for undertaking the commitment to cover the non-Plan revenue gaps of the states. The result is a pattern of distribution of statutory transfers among the states which is becoming more and more regressive with the passage of five-year periods and at the same time does not allow for enforcement of norms, be they for raising revenue or for efficient planning. The Seventh Finance Commission which will have to start functioning by June-July this year, if it has to strike a new path, must not feel bound to underwrite the states' non-Plan revenue gaps. Here, while it depends on how the Commission itself views its task, at least the terms of reference should not try to provide the Commission with any alibi by requiring it, directly or indirectly, to fulfil such an obligation.||I.

Exemptions make the effective average rates lower than the stautory rates and the relative exemptions depress the tax progressivity at higher income brackets as compared to the lower ones. The higher the net income group an individual belongs to, the higher is the exemption and consequently the higher is the rate of return on investment in tax exempt securities.||M. Lakshmiswaramma,M.

Why are we not experiencing an upsurge in steel demand as we did during 1950-64? What are the prospects for a substantial increase in steel demand in the long run? This note attempts to answer these questions. First, the trends in apparent consumption of finished mild steel in the country during the last two decades are examined. The factors responsible for the lower rate of growth of consumption of steel in the last decade are then discussed. Finally, an attempt is made to unravel long-term prospects for steel demand in the country.||S. D. Kshirsagar

08/10/1977- ||special articles||4366006||Judging Economic Development: The Case of China||In any attempt to judge economic development, three broad categories of questions arise: first, the impact which economic change has on welfare; second, the objective historical process called 'development' and the specification of its parameters for use as yardsticks to evaluate contemporary development efforts; and third, the evaluation of a society's success in achieving its own, self-prescribed goals. About the first category, the intrinsic difficulty is the definition and measurement of welfare. In analysing the second, the difficulty lies in identifying the necessary changes for the transition to the predominant use of modern production technologies. The last category requires explicit consideration of a given leadership's objectives and of the resources at its disposal in accomplishing them. Although this paper reviews evaluative criteria of all three general types in relation to the Chinese experience, it is concerned primarily with the second category - viz, economic development as a process which can be analysed independently of both a given society's stated goals and the analyst's own values and welfare objectives. Part I of the paper successively examines the GNP, welfare and relativistic (self-prescribed goals) criteria, and briefly examines China's performance according to each. Part III explores an alternative approach, viz, the identification and analysis of factors which bear on the imminence, in the observable present and past, of successful long-run economic growth.||Carl Riskin

The nucleus of this paper consists, therefore, of precisely one such analysis - of the disintegrating small-production economy of the Deccan in the period shortly before and after the cotton boom (the 1860s).||Jairus Banaji

In fact, the trend towards cordiality in US-India relations began in 1976, during the Emergency. This article examines the various ways adopted - and the various rationalisations offered - by the US to 'contain' India and prevent it from assuming its legitimate status as a middle power of the region. The article argues that the present posture of 'accommodation' has to be viewed as only a supplement to, and a subtler continuation of, the earlier policy of 'containment', since it would be unrealistic to expect a superpower like the US to abandon completely its strategic perception of the 'role' it assigns to various regional powers like India.||Baldev Raj Nayar

A Study of the Bihar Movement: III||The Bihar Movement (1974-75) under the leadership of Jayaprakash Narayan did not aim at merely bringing about a few changes here and there; it aimed at a 'Total Revolution' in the country. Any revolutionary movement, more so such a 'Total Revolution', presupposes an ideology which presents a profile, general or specific of the future social order; programmes and strategies which concretise that ideology; personnel - leaders and cadre - who carry out the programme; and an organisation linking the revolutionaries at various levels through communication and action. The present study examines the Bihar Movement with reference to these prerequisites. This, the third and concluding part, examines the Sarvodaya ideology and movement, specifically its attitude towards such concepts as parliamentary democracy and planned economic development. The study shows that despite Sarvodaya's disenchantment with these concepts as enunciated and practised by the Congress, the movement's relation with the Congress party and government has been generally close and even excellent except in recent years. Attitude towards the Congress Party has been a crucial factor shaping Sarvodaya ideology, and the Bihar Movement in fact split on this question. The achievements and failures of the Bihar Movement are summed up. The author finds that despite the claim of being part of a 'Total Revolution', the Movement was essentially a protest movement, aiming at certain limited reforms of the existing order.||Ghanshyam Shah

For long has the farce of commitment to Five-Year Plan targets been maintained with a calculated reluctance to come to grips with the difficult and unpalatable decisions which they call for. Politicians have used the Plans to inveigle the masses with promises of the millenium; bureaucrats have been consistently cynical about the Plans and their targets; and both have wanted more to spend without ever having the intention of supporting, not to speak of implementing, policies which necessarily would have hurt the well-to-do and the powerful. The rolling plan will resolve none of these contradictions in our planning.||A. Vaidyanathan,I. S. Gulati

22/10/1977- ||special articles||4366042||Aspects of Fiji Indian History, 1879-1939: A Society in Transition: II||Following an agreement between the colonial governments in India and Fiji, Indians were indentured to work in the sugar plantations and mills which were started in Fiji by the Australia-based Colonial Sugar Refining Company from 1879 onwards. This migration of Indian labour to Fiji went on uninterrupted till the end of 1919 when, following nationalist pressure in India, it was stopped from the beginning of 1920. The Indians in Fiji had to live and work in extremely harsh conditions; yet by far the majority of these labourers made Fiji their home, even when they had an option of being repatriated to India at the cost of the government at the end of their contracts. This article presents a historical account of the migration of Indian labourers to Fiji, the conditions of their life and work, and the impact the new environment had on the traditional attitude towards caste, religion, language, etc. It traces the gradual transformation of traditional Indian society and the growing diversification of the occupations. The major part of the paper deals with the struggles launched by the Indians for economic and political rights, including the right to adult franchise, and the attempts of the colonial government to contain these demands. The article is published in two parts. The first part appeared last week. This, the second part, describes the prolonged struggles of the Indian labourers with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, and the gradual politicisation of the struggle. The last section traces the actual political struggles that culminated in the constitutional settlement of 1937, which still fell far short of Indian aspirations.||Ahmed Ali

The available evidence for Delhi Union Territory suggests that this is indeed the case, so that now the area has a doctor: population ratio which is comparable to that in many developed countries, though in India as a whole the ratio is still around 1:4,000, or about 25 per cent of the ratio in developed countries. There has also been a shift towards employment in the public sector, increasingly in large hospitals, and the proportion of doctors offering specialist services has risen considerably.||Roger Jeffery

17/9/1977- ||special articles||4365934||Constraints on Growth and Policy Options||It is the contention of this paper that (a) The possibilities of accelerating overall growth, even to the degree visualised in the long-term projections given in the revised Fifth Plan, are doubtful essentially because of the severe constraint on the possibility of stepping up the growth of agriculture and export. (b) The constraints on agriculture are in part technological and in large part institutional; while in the case of exports the ramification of a significantly more outward-oriented growth may involve changes in many fundamental tenets, including political, of current development policy. (c) To continue committing investment programmes (both the level and the composition) without regard to the above constraints, exposes the economy to risks of inflation and wasteful use of limited investible resources. (d) With a modest growth, it is inevitable that redistributive measures should play a much bigger role in efforts to improve the conditions of the poor, the more so because with slow growth the possibility of the poor getting jobs and maintaining the real wage level is greatly reduced. (e) A larger anti-poverty programme, consisting essentially of employment generating growth, infrastructural and productive agricultural projects concentrated in the poor areas, is possible provided that the fiscal instrument is effectively used to contain the consumption of the rich. There is also much scope for increasing the impact of such programmes by greater care in selecting areas and in the planning and implementation of the projects. (f) Both with anti-poverty and agricultural programmes, the development of viable and responsible local institutions is critical to success.||A. Vaidyanathan

26/3/1977- ||review of agriculture, march 1977||4365434||Changes in Acreage and Tenure Structure of Land Holdings in Haryana, 1962-72||Seven important findings emerge from this study: (1) The Green Revolution, by reducing the minimum acreage required for a viable holding, greatly accelerated the subdivision of family farms between 1961 and 1972. This is the dominant cause of the dramatic downward shift in the acreage structure of operated holdings during the decade. (2) The accelerated subdivision of owned land by itself altered the tenure structure in favour of pure owners. (3) Widespread resumption of leased-out land for self-cultivation was mainly a response by land owners to the opportunities afforded by productivity-raising technology, and only in small part traceable to fear of tenancy legislation. (4) Apprehension about tenancy legislation instead led to more rapid 'tenant switching' of whatever leased-in acres had not been resumed. However, in wet areas, other region-specific methods were also used by land owners to ensure the security of their leased out land. (5) Resumption converted a substantial number of mixed tenure households into pure owners. It also sharply reduced the number of pure tenants in the two regions where the new technology was most widely adopted. (6) The more than doubling of the number of male agricultural labourers from 1961 to 1971, however, cannot be attributed to the loss of land previously owned or leased in by households which are now landless agricultural labour households. (7) No household cultivating under 15 acres today, and no landless agricultural labour household, lost any land by sale to pay off debt, or sale for any other reason. None lost land through foreclosure of mortgages, and none leased out land previously self-cultivated.||Sheila Bhalla

The politics of these countries also seem to take its cue from poverty, through appeals to the poor and through various policies and programmes for their relief. But the precise ways in which the economics and the politics of poverty interact and condition the processes of change are not clear. In order to understand this interaction between economic and non-economic phenomena, which are nowhere more strikingly evident than in the so-called developing countries, an attempt is made here to look back in history and see how far poverty was a problem in western Europe in the 19th century in the sense it is today in south Asia, what its effects were on the politics of that period, and how the politics and economics of poverty affected the course of development of countries like France and Britain.||K.

Their contribution in enabling us to arrive at any precise formulations about the political behaviour of the Indian electorate has been marginal. This is dismaying as a huge quantum of scarce national resources has been involved in the whole enterprise of election studies. It is not argued here that election studies should be abandoned altogether. While their predictive capability is limited, they may still provide a cumulative, long-term view of the processes of politicisation of the electorate and of the development of India's political system. For this latter purpose, however, there is need to change our approach to election studies.||Imtiaz Ahmad

The solution of the problems of poverty, inequality and unemployment requires a different strategy. Elements in this strategy involve the provision of opportunities for 'self-defined' work, encouragement of production of 'use-values' and strengthening of small organisational structures that are not based on the principle of pure exchange. A reordering of the development effort on these lines requires that development be understood not only in terms of GNP, material goods and use-values, but also as a 'state of mind'. To understand the existing 'state of mind'-which values goods, activities, policies and programmes that lead to increases in poverty-one has to examine the system of education in the developing countries.||Romesh Diwan

In fact, Schultz's characterisation of traditional agriculture was itself erroneous because there was an implicit assumption behind all that Schultz said of a certain mode of production - cultivation with hired labour. In thus implicitly attributing a spurious universality to capitalist farming, Schultz was being blind to agricultural reality in underdeveloped countries, besides failing to take into account the persistence of peasant farming and family farming in the most advanced capitalist countries like the United States.||S.

08/1/1977- ||special articles||4365234||On Welfare and Population Control in the Second-Best World||In most cases it is doubtful that the economist can indicate from the viewpoint of social efficiency that population limitation was or was not worthwhile for a particular country. But given a complex set of national objectives the picture would become, paradoxically, clearer. To clarify it further there is much to be gained from some research in particular economies. That way some Second-Best observations may be made with a bearing on policy: for instance, given that we intend to reduce urban congestion without forced migration and without infrastructural expenditure, will a reduction in birth-rate in urban areas serve, or merely encourage a greater inflow of migrants to meet the same labour demand? If the latter, should we concentrate on reducing the birth-rate in the rural out-migration regions? Surely these are the more pertinent areas of investigation, in the realm of the Second-Best? And yet the criticism is heard: that way you divert attention from the First-Best. You make population appear the only problem. The real problems are quietly forgotten. That is why I insist that the economist spell out the objectives he is assuming. It would be a service to the world if governments were to do the same. But, curiously, they are ashamed to do so. How often does a government admit to giving heavy weighting to the views of industrially influential members of its society, as part of its national programme? A programme both to clothe the poor, and not offend big business. Why are we not simply honest to our gods?||Nigel R. Crook

To give shape to a Marxian theory of foreign trade, we have to go into Marx's theory of capitalism. We shall first present Ricardo's principle of comparative costs. Then we shall give an outline of Marx's theory of money, prices and interest; and next of his theory of wages, profit and interest. Thereafter, we shall take up the question of interrelationship between accumulation, employment and wages in Marx's scheme, to be followed by his theory of value, price and unequal exchange. Now we would be in a position to correlate these elements into a theory of international trade and capital flow. We shall conclude with a few observations on the interconnection between the state, foreign trade and would market.||Ranjit Sau

24/9/1977- ||review of agriculture, september 1977||4365954||Tubewell Irrigation in the Gangetic Plains||The Gangetic basin accounted for two-thirds of the tubewell irrigation of the country in 1972-73. Together with the Indus basin, the share was 95 per cent of the national tubewell-irrigated area. Within these two basins, covering the vast plains of the north, the development of tubewell irrigation diminishes in force and concentration as one moves from Punjab, Haryana, and west UP in the west to east UP, Bihar and West Bengal in the eastern plains. What are the forces which have made investment in private tubewells much more profitable in the western plains than in the eastern plains? It is seen that the 'minimum economic size' of holding which makes tubewell investment worthwhile tends to rise substantially as one moves from west to east. Over time, however, this minimum economic size has declined sharply in all the regions of the plains - with 1965 being the turning point in this downward movement. It was thus in the mid-sixties that the so-called 'tubewell explosion' began in the country. The minimum economic size of a holding for a tubewell in Bihar and West Bengal is still high, mainly because of the poor progress in land consolidation, inadequate agricultural extension service, insufficient credit facilities for short-term credit required for the high assocated-cost of HYV-rrigated agriculture, etc -some of which factors are amenable to state intenvention.||B.

That expenditure on meeting these needs is socially productive is obvious, but it can even be economically productive in the narrow sense of the term. A need-based approach to rural development can help generate the resources for the relatively large investments required for the widespread development of irrigation and fuel supply. Meeting needs today can be made consonant with investment for the future. This paper is a preliminary analysis of the energy needs of rural India in the light of basic human needs.||Arjun Makhijani

A common view is that the revolution has been a success in the wheat areas, but not in the rice areas.

In this paper the author carries out such an analysis for two wheat producing states - Punjab (including Haryana) and Uttar Pradesh - and two rice producing states - West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.||Amal Krishna Dey

26/3/1977- ||special article||4365441||Colonial Economics in Southeast India||India's poverty is largely attributable to colonial policies associated with the rise of British capitalism. The country continues to be poor since Independence mainly because it is still exploited within a system of world-wide imperialist relations. This paper sketches the main events in one district of southern India that have contributed to the extreme poverty of most of its people. The district is Thanjavur. To understand this poverty we have to go back two hundred years. It is true that some people, especially the one-quarter who were slaves, were poor long before the 1770s, but most became poorer thereafter, and most have remained so since.||Kathleen Gough
30/4/1977- ||special articles||4365545||The Media in a Free Society: Proposals for Restructuring||Freedom of expression, a prerequisite for the articulation and enjoyment of all other freedoms, ranks first among the seven fundamental freedoms listed under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution. Freedom of expression is also invariably the first casualty in any police state; and censorship and news management are the primary tools of every dictatorship. This was most vividly demonstrated in the actions of the government of India following the imposition of internal Emergency on June 25, 1975. This article reviews briefly these actions of the government and goes on to consider in detail the specific ways in which greater freedom and democratisation of the mass media as a whole can be brought about. Such measures are absolutely necessary if we are to avoid a repetition of attempts to stifle freedom of expression. The article discusses how best freedom can be restored to the Press, Radio, TV and other components of mass media; how Samachar, a creature of Emergency, can be liberated; how AIR and Doordarshan ought to be restructured; how newspapers too need to be democratised by making them in spirit and in reality public utilities and not private profit-making corporations. It touches on such aspects as delinking and diffusion of newspaper ownership, relations between the owner of a newspaper and its editor, editorial freedom and the role of the journalists themselves in resisting various kinds of blandishments. In short, the article argues for a wholly new philosophy of mass communications.||B. G. Verghese

05/11/1977-12/11/1977||special articles||4366080||Agricultural Growth: Role of Institutional and Infrastructural Factors||This paper brings together findings from recent studies which lead to the following conclusions. (i) India's major agricultural output problem has been that nearly two-thirds of the area under rice has had either negative rates of growth of output, or rates well below the rate of population growth. Investment in infrastructure, while necessary, is not likely to be sufficient in these traditional rice growing areas because major institutional problems, of land distribution, tenancy and unrestricted private property rights in land still stand in the way of increasing agricultural production. (ii) In many of the slow growing wheat areas, the required investment in infrastructure will be even, greater than was necessary to develop those districts which experienced rapid growth during the 1960s. (iii) The downward shift in acreage structure in the green revolution wheat areas threatens to choke off prospects for further private farm investment there. (iv) Even the highest rates of agricultural growth recorded anywhere in India have failed to induce a proportionate shift of working population to jobs outside agriculture. Instead 'de-industrialisation' of the labour force has taken place. (v) A very serious consequence of the piling up of population in agriculture has been that productivity per male agricultural worker has failed to rise much, if at all, even in the areas where the greatest increases in productivity per hectare took place. In India as a whole, it has fallen. (vi) These findings underline the urgency of making a very substantial increase in the rate of investment in non-agricultural sectors in addition to more direct investment in agriculture itself.||Sheila Bhalla

Without doubt, Western theoretical thought structures in the social sciences have played a vital role in sustaining in the Third World 'correct' and 'acceptable' scientific interpretations of socio-economic reality as well as 'suitable' rationalisations - the 'new economic order', for instance - of the political and economic intercourse between rich and poor countries.||Michel Chossudovsky

However, in a recent statement the Prime Minister exhorted the handloom industry to dispense with the official protection given to it so far and to walk on its own feet. This exhortation may have been based on the apparently impressive growth of cloth production in the decentralised sector, as seen from figures of industrial output. However, before we take this picture of growth seriously and base future policy towards the decentralised sector on it, we must answer the following questions: (a) What is the decentralised sector and where has the growth been really concentrated? (b) How reliable is the method of estimating output in the decentralised sector?||Mridul Eapen

This target cannot be met if the country relies exclusively on natural growth in the export of products and services already being exported. One area where innovation is possible is the use of multinational corporations, their marketing skills and global network to augment Indian exports. Our ability to use MNCs would depend on the sophistication of our understanding of these corporations as managerial systems rather than mere economic or legal entities. What is necessary is a selective, managerially-oriented export strategy which makes use of the MNCs. An approach for developing such a strategy is argued in this paper.||C. K. Prahalad

This is brought about by management development of the organisation as also its managers individually and collectively. The process of management development is substantially strengthened if an 'in-house group approach' is adopted to management consulting. The process of consulting activity contributes to faculty growth and development, improvement of teaching effectiveness and development of educational material. It also provides an excellent avenue for application of current knowledge and research findings in solving real-life problems. Nonetheless, the real danger of imbalance between the commercial aspects of consulting and academic and management development must be firmly kept in view. It is necessary, therefore, to have a clear framework in order to relate consulting activity to institutional objectives and to ensure that explicit guidelines are developed and administered from a position of tough-minded objectivity.||S.

1/8/1977- ||institutional bases of rural poverty||4365851||Performance and Prospects of Crop Production in India||This is an admittedly pessimistic assessment of the prospects for accelerating agricultural growth, at any rate in the next decade. A degree of optimism may well have been justified a decade back. At that time, it seemed that given the abysmally low productivity and technological level of Indian agriculture, rapid growth should be relatively easy to achieve by a combination of massive investments in irrigation and fertilisers, supported by extension and credit. The advent of the HYVs in the mid-sixties lent greater confidence to this view. But the fact that, after a decade of accelerated irrigation development, fertiliser use, and the rapid spread of HYVs, growth rates of production have not increased, and may have in fact fallen, compels a sober re-assessment. This is all the more important because, directly or indirectly, many of the problems of the Indian economy in recent years - whether it be inflation, stagnation of investment, or imbalances between production capacity and demand - are traceable to the poor performance of agriculture. To persist in planning based on a naive optimism of agricultural prospects in the face of such experience, can only further compound these problems.||A. Vaidyanathan

Public investment should be stepped up in the rural sector in projects which can be (a) directly undertaken by the government and where leakages of funds are the minimum, and (b) which have large complementarity with the private resources of the farmers, namely, land and labour in the backward regions and among the poorer farmers. Such a strategy may raise the aggregate level of savings because of the exploitation of the complementarities between public and private investment to the maximum over wide areas in the country. Further, since capital-output ratio in these areas can be expected to be lower, the overall rate of growth of agricultural output may be higher than what has been achieved so far. This is likely to generate larger employment and income for the poorer segments. Although the proportion of output marketed per unit of output may be lower, the aggregate marketed surplus as well as savings may turn out to be higher because of the higher overall growth rate.||C.

The impact of India's exchange rate policy will be studied from some of these angles. An effort will also be made to compare the structure of exchange rates of the rupee vis-a-vis some major currencies under the present policy with the structure that would have prevailed under an alternative policy.||Satyendra S.

The basic pattern of asset-holding, the authors conclude, has not undergone any significant change. If at all, the share of the top asset-holders has registered varying increases in most of the states. The asset distribution in Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh exhibits a high degree of inequality. There does not, however, seem to be any relationship between the degree of inequality and the average value of assets per household.||R. P. Pathak,K. R. Ganapathy,Y. U. K. Sarma
24/9/1977- ||review of agriculture, september 1977||4365951||Some Aspects of Employment and Unemployment in Agriculture||In this article are discussed some crucial aspects of the employment and unemployment conditions in Indian agriculture. In Section I, we shall try to take a view about the works already done by different research workers in this field. In Section II, we shall take yet another look at the 'surplus labour model' with the help of fresh results involving disaggregated data for Assam. In Section III, we shall discuss the seasonal pattern of employment in agriculture for the region of Assam. In Section IV, we shall try to give a picture regarding the nature and extent of underemployment in agriculture for some regions in India with the help of another statistical analysis. In Section V, we shall present our views of the unemployment in agriculture and its policy implications.||Manabendu Chattopadhyay

24/12/1977- ||special articles||4366224||Growth Possibilities in the Indian Economy||This paper argues that the 'initial conditions' for the Sixth Plan are substantially different compared to the earlier experience and consequently the possibilities of growth are much wider. Among other changes, the most notable ones are (i) the nature, structure and levels of private remittances that are being recorded in the Indian economy, (ii) large unutilised capacity in the capital goods sector, (iii) the ability of the Indian economy to increase exports due to its diversified base, (iv) the existence of a large stock of technical manpower, and (v) the existence of buffer stocks of critical commodities, e g, cereals and foreign exchange. It is in this context that the author argues that, even within the present framework, growth possibilities now exist for the Indian economy which are of a substantially higher order in comparison with the trend rate of growth.||Vijay Laxman Kelkar

This article attempts to present some of the issues involved in the light of earlier experiences with institutions of participative management. The basis of co-partnership, its social content, and the way it has worked in the Indian situation are some of the issues examined.

01/10/1977- ||special articles||4365981||Changes in Distribution of Household Income, Consumption and Wealth in Rural Areas||Studies of shifts in distribution of household income and consumption have covered several aspects of such distribution, such as distribution of pre-tax and post-tax (disposable) income, distribution between rural and urban areas, possible effects of differential levels of prices between rural and urban areas on the inequality measure, distribution at constant prices and inter-state and intra-state differentials in the distribution pattern. All these studies cover by and large the same time horizon, and often use the same basic source of data. The purpose of the present paper is to examine the results of these studies about the pattern of distribution of income, consumption and household assets in rural areas over the last decade or so and to draw conclusions regarding the changes in distribution over time.||Uma Datta Roy Choudhury
1/8/1977- ||an untold story||4365850||Abu Taher's Last Testament: Bangladesh: The Unfinished Revolution||The story of Abu Taher's life cannot be summed up easily or simply, nor can the sequence of events which brought it to an abrupt heroic close. The time involved spans more than half a decade. It has been a complex period of extraordinary violence and brutality. In the past two years alone Bangladesh has been ruled by a succession of four regimes, each succeeding the other by force of arms. Out of the struggle for independence in 1971 nearly a million persons died in war or from starvation. In 1974 a hundred thousand peasants succumbed to a famine which was largely man-made. In 1975 Bangladesh entered a new phase of political upheavals. Two military putsches involving assassinations and grim jail-house murders were followed by a revolutionary army mutiny. It was a soldiers' uprising that had not been seen in the subcontinent since 1857, when the colonial army of India rebelled against the British. It was this insurrection on November 7, 1975, which deeply shook the polity of Bangladesh and more than any other event brought historic prominence to Abu Taher. The purpose of this article is to describe the history of the events which gave birth to the November 7 Uprising. But more than that the object is to reveal the details of Abu Taher's secret trial and subsequent execution. The men, whom Abu Taher calls upon to realise their moral responsibility or face the condemnation of history, would today face arrest in Bangladesh were they to publicly speak what they know. No doubt one day they will, but until then the report of the present writer, and the publication of Taher's own testimony, must suffice as an opening statement on the case. The years ahead will certainly provide many more.||Lawrence Lifschultz

The Finance Commissions have been severely hindered by the restricted role they have charted out for themselves by confining their recommendations to meeting the needs arising from the non-plan revenue accounts of the states. Further, even within this restricted scope, the federal transfers recommended by the Finance Commissions have been unsuccessful in fulfilling the objectives of equity. Some rich, relatively urbanised states, have ended up with sizeable surpluses in their revenue accounts; on the other hand, some of the poorer states in spite of low levels of public services, could not qualify for statutory grants.||M.

Of these, the first is the process of differentiation of the peasantry confidently expected to produce or reinforce the basic social classes of capitalism. Basic political strategies and class alliances have been anticipated and planned according to how questions concerning the peasantry's differentiation have been answered. This article therefore considers this issue, in the light of scholarly researches of Russia in the 1920s, for the so-called 'developing countries' of today.||Teodor Shanin

25/6/1977- ||special article||4365729||Squaring the Circle: Union Budget for 1977-78||What the 1977 Budget lacks is a clear direction of policy which the new government proposes to pursue. While it deplores industrialisation and is yet to chalk out clearly the role of 'modern industry' in economic growth, it provides far-reaching concessions for investment in fixed assets and in corporate securities as also for merger of loss-making units with profit-making ones. These measures, viewed along with references in the Budget speech to "liberalisation in import policy" and to "uneconomic size of industrial units" in the Economic Survey, would suggest that the new government would essentially continue the trend towards encouragement of free market forces which has been so clearly visible in the last two years. While the accent on competition and on efficient operation of industrial units is desirable, the basic point is that investment priorities in that case will primarily be determined by the existing skewed income distribution. The immediate impact of the Budget on investment is likely to be limited in view of the rather modest step-up in investment expenditure. Even this modest rise may have to be financed through inflationary resources.||

25/6/1977- ||review of agriculture, june 1977||4365721||Rural Employment, Wages and Labour Markets in India: A Survey of Research||This survey of empirical work on the rural labour market is divided into three sections. Section I surveys the literature on size, characteristics and composition of the rural working force and employment, particularly the changes over time. Changes in the composition of rural work participation and in the distribution of employment, viewed together with the pattern of migration, would indicate at the macro level, adjustments of labour supply to changing income-earning opportunities. Section II covers studies on labour demand implications of agricultural growth with technological change, focusing on the respective employment effects of the seed-water-fertiliser innovation and of the tractor technology depending on the composition of its operational uses. With an eye to the labour demand effects of the changes in scale of production, technology, and related changes in the nature of tenancy and other agrarian institutions, the author discusses studies on employment and wage rates for agricultural labourers, on changes in labour's share of valued added, and on the broad correlates of regional and/or intertemporal variation in wage rates. Section III is concerned more exclusively with the relatively small amount of literature relating to the process of rural wage determination, the allocation of household labour supply and of demand for farm labour by the source of supply. The issue of seasonality is discussed more directly in this context. The various implications of institutional differences in the modes of wage payment, labour contracts, and the nature of land (lease) markets are also considered in some details there. This paper will be published in three parts. Section I appears below; Section II and III will be published in the following weeks.||Kalpana Bardhan

What, however, is not clear is the distribution of gains, which, this paper seeks to examine. In Section I the regional pattern of Soviet trade, and economic and military aid to the Third World and the Soviet balance of payments vis-a-vis both the Third World and the West are discussed. Section II briefly surveys past studies on the terms of trade between the Third World and the USSR. Section III examines switch trade. Section IV reviews the existing literature on the terms of trade among the CMEA partners with a view to gaining an insight into the Soviet methods of price-fixation in foreign trade. Section V contains the results of the author's own calculation of Soviet gains from exports to the Third World as revealed by Soviet trade statistics. The same sources are used again to unravel further examples of triangular trade which virtually amounts to switch trade. The penultimate section takes up the question of the appropriate exchange rate for the Soviet rouble, and finally, some broad conclusions are offered.||N. K. Chandra

27/8/1977- ||review of management, august 1977||4365877||Impact of High Capital Cost on Cash Flows of Industrial Units||The capital cost of industrial projects has risen sharply in the last few years. Resort to external funds for financing investment has also increased, while interest rates on term finance have been raised. A possible approach to assessing the impact of escalation in capital cost and increase in interest rate charges on term-finance would be to identify the amount of incremental funds required by an industrial unit on account of these factors. Additionally, there will be enhancement in capital charge on account of depreciation. The purpose of this article is to quantify, in certain hypothetical cases, incremental requirement of funds in the form of depreciation and debt servicing on the basis of certain simplifying assumptions.||N. J. Jhaveri
15/10/1977- ||special articles||4366021||Planning Process, Planning Commission and Rollover Planning: Some Basic Issues||The present paper attempts to argue three major points: (1) Before considering the method of planning - fixed or rolling - priority should be accorded to the basic problem of restoring the credibility of the planning process itself and this has to be done at the political level. No plan is likely to succeed in the absence of this essential requirement. (2) As regards the method of planning - rollover as against fixed plans - each has its strong points as well as problems, the rolling method being considerably more complex than the fixed plan method and the desirable mode of planning should be determined on the basis of the availability of certain prerequisites. (3) In the present Indian context, the essential prerequisites of the rolling plan method appear to be demanding and in the absence of adequate preparation and deliberations, the prospects for its working are far from bright and it is likely to lead to unintended results. In the light of the discussion, the author concludes that the abrupt changeover in the basic method of planning does not augur well for restoration of credibility in the planning process.||Suresh D.

03/12/1977- ||special articles||4366155||Opportunity to Face Basic Issues||The real ills of the present educational system are its elitist nature, its heavy pushout and dropout rate, its scandalously poor rural school environment, its growing unemployed and unemployable product outcome, its indifference to the 70 per cent adult illiterates and neglect of the special claims of first generation learners, its minimal learning and atrocious evaluation system, and its widening gap between the overt (prescribed) curriculum and the hidden (real) curriculum. Compared to these basic ills, which the new system provides an opportunity of bringing out into the open with the possibility of remedial action, the technical problems of how the 10-year school should be staged, where the +2 higher secondary stage should be placed and what kind of mix of general and vocational learning should be planned are of secondary significance. If the basic issues are dealt with, the technical problems can also be solved.||Malcolm S. Adiseshiah

During the regime of Sheikh Mujib, the rural rich contended successfully for political power; and even though this class lost political power at the national level following the political changes in the later part of 1975, it continues to be dominant in the rural areas. This article examines the nature and significance of these changing production relations in Bangladesh.||B. K. Jahangir

In appraising groundwater resources, it is imperative that a clear distinction be made between stock and flow dimension. From the stock viewpoint, groundwater is probably an immense resource in India. But, judged from the flow angle, it is a bountiful resource only in the eastern Gangetic plains. Prudence requires utilisation of groundwater resource at a long-run annual rate of no more than annual accretion to groundwater stock. Excess withdrawal is permissible only in areas prone to waterlogging.||B. D. Dhawan

16/4/1977- ||special articles||4365502||Exports and the Indian Economy||The policy of export-led fast growth for India is unlikely to succeed to any great extent, mainly because exports on a scale significant to provide a boost to the Indian economy are bound to meet with growing resistance in the international market. Expansion of India's manufacturing activity for the export market is also costly, requiring increasingly large budgetary subsidies to the exporting units. Thus emphasis on export performance alone will distort national industrial priorities and policies, and will further reduce the domestic market for industrial goods without any assurance of a compensatory growth of the export market. In allowing a large part of imports to grow uncontrolled and then, in order to pay for them, pushing up exports even at such cost, the government is merely accepting the path of least resistance. Imports are being made under pressure exerted by some powerful lobbies in the country. The cost of exports on the other hand is being borne by a number of much weaker groups. This imbalance in the basic forces on the two sides makes the result of this (however futile) export-import game predictable for India.||Nirmala Benerjee

14/5/1977- ||special articles||4365591||Nuclear Cartelisation: Theory and Practice||The era of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has been characterised by increasing transfers of nuclear facilities across national boundaries. Most of these transfer recipients - which include India - are nuclear threshold nations who are not parties to the NPT. This technology transfer has come about as a result of two seemingly contradictory tendencies: an anxiety on the part of nations possessing advanced nuclear technology, especially the US, to restrict the spread of fission technology to as few nations as possible; and an equally intense anxiety on the part of the same nations, including the US, to export nuclear fuel systems, practising in that process what can only be described as 'cut throat' methods. Moves towards some sort of a nuclear cartelisation - which are anyway unlikely to succeed because of inherent rivalries and jealousies among these powers - are part of an attempt to resolve these contradictions. This paper makes a survey of these attempts to 'plug the holes in the NPT' through a process of nuclear cartelisation.||S. Jaishankar,C. Raja Mohan

On property rights and profit, in state farming, collective and co-operative farming, and private farming, on decentralisation of decision making process in industry, on wages and profits - on each of these questions, the Brezhnev Constitution makes significant departures from the provisions of the Stalin Constitution. This article discusses some of these aspects of the Brezhnev Constitution and attempts to analyse their implications for Soviet economy and polity.||R. G. Gidadhubli

In the year 1901 a massive programme of naval build-up was launched to create a home market for German industry, all in the name of nationalism and patriotism. German history remembers it as the fateful 'marriage of rye and steel' which in due course gave birth to a Hitler. Did something like that happen in India recently? Was a similar marriage consummated in India during 1967-77 between the ambitious section of the rural oligarchy and the monopoly capital of commerce and industry?||Ranjit Sau

2/7/1977- ||special articles||41497077||New Lines and Old Ways||The most important features in the budget this year are not the tax proposals, but the provisions regarding investment allowance, fiscal concessions to small industries going to rural areas and to large industries spending money on rural development, the tax rebates for the use of knowhow developed in India, special tax advantages for healthy industrial units taking over sick ones and the widening of the exemption from the capital gains tax. It is to the Planning Commission that one now looks. The pattern of Plan allocations remains practically the same as it was, with some increase for agriculture and rural areas. The plans for decentralised, employment-oriented, essential goods production are not yet ready. It is of course difficult to change the pattern within a short time, when there are large commitments and spill-overs and when intensive preparatory work is essential before new lines are struck. But, still, the task has to be faced and the investment pattern has to be reshaped soon with a different set of social preference weights.||Bhabhatosh Datta

26/2/1977- ||review of management, february 1977||4365349||Professionalising Management of Business in India: Problems and Prospects||This paper has a three-fold task. Firstly, it argues, perhaps contrary to popular belief, that the most important requirement-in fact, a pre-condition-for any real progress towards the goal of professionalisation of management is not management training but the acquisition of effective managerial power and autonomy by the managers. This argument is based on the reasoning that, however well-trained and competent the professional manager, professionalism in management can be, and often is, easily frustrated by the intervention of 'controlling interests' usually in pursuit of their self-interest. We shall attempt to support this by concrete evidence. Secondly, the paper analyses the location of controlling power in Indian companies and brings out the fact that in most Indian companies, including the large ones, the controlling power is located, not in the hands of professional managers but in those of controlling interests so that the pre-condition stated above is not fulfilled. On our test, not many of even the largest companies in India can be described as professionally managed because professional managers lack the power and autonomy necessary to put their professionalism in practice. Finally, the paper discusses the emergence of financial institutions as a countervailing power to the power of controlling groups and analyses the consequences of this development from the viewpoint of professionalisation of management.||L.

11/6/1977- ||special article||4365683||Import Substitution, Domestic Resource Cost, and Key Sectors in the Indian Economy||With the industrialisation policy of the 1950s and 1960s, India turned explicitly to a growth strategy, based upon the promotion of import substitution (IS) in consumer goods, basic intermediates, and capital goods industries. As a consequence, domestic manufactured goods as a proportion of the total supply of manufactured goods increased from 0.781 in 1955-56 to 0.857 in 1973-74. Similarly, the share of imports in consumer goods declined steadily from 12.9 per cent in 1955-56 to 3.6 per cent in 1973-74, with imports generally shifting towards investment and intermediate goods. Although the changes outlined, as well as their role in the process of change in industrial structure, have been researched into by earlier writers on the subject, less attention has been given to evaluate the economic efficiency of imports as net savers of foreign exchange or to examine the cost of distortions to the economy due to domestic policies favouring IS. This paper is an attempt to examine these questions, empirically, in a static comparative general equilibrium framework. The central theme is that domestic policies favouring IS in some major import substituting sectors conflicted with efficient utilisation of resources.||R. G. Nambiar

09/7/1977- ||special articles||4365752||Rural Employment, Wages and Labour Markets in India: A Survey of Research: III||This survey of empirical work on the rural labour market is divided into three sections. Section I surveys the literature on size, characteristics and composition of the rural working force and employment, particularly the changes over time. Changes in the composition of rural work participation and in the distribution of employment, viewed together with the pattern of migration, would indicate at the macro level, adjustments of labour supply to changing income-earning opportunities. Section II covers studies on labour demand implications of agricultural growth with technological change, focusing on the respective employment effects of the seed-water-fertiliser innovation and of the tractor technology depending on the composition of its operational uses. With an to the labour demand effects of the changes in scale of production, technology, and related changes in the nature of tenancy and other agrarian institutions, the author discusses studies on employment and wage rates for agricultural labourers, on changes in labour's share of value added, and on the board correlates of regional and/or intertemporal variation in wage rates. Section III is concerned more exclusively with the relatively small amount of literature relating to the process of rural wage determination, the allocation of household labour supply and of demand for farm labour by the source of supply. The issue of seasonality is discussed more directly in this context. The various implications of institutional differences in the modes of wage payment, labour contracts, and the nature of land (lease) markets are also considered in some details there. This is the concluding installment of this paper which has been published in three parts. Section I appeared in the Review of Agriculture, June 25, and Section II was published last week.||Kalpana Bardhan

The same experience also poses the important question: what needs to be done in the related fields of trade union organisation and industrial relations in order that a return to the kind of authoritarian political order that prevailed during the Emergency will never be allowed in future?||Bagaram Tulpule

The author describes the continuing struggle between two broadly identifiable approaches to the problems of industrial management and deals with the establishment of the 'holding company', SAIL, and the consequent problems of 'centralisation'. Other kinds of constraints, mainly of an administrative and political character, and the internal problems of management are also touched upon. Finally, a brief, descriptive account of Durgapur township is provided. Parts III and IV of the article will appear in the next two issues.||Bagaram Tulpule

In many ways the period since 1965-66, the last year of the Third Five-Year Plan, marks a watershed. It is argued that the decade 1966-1975 represents a well marked departure from the trends established during the first three plans - particularly in respect of public sector investment both in the aggregate and in crucial sectors such as transportation and communication. To a significant extent the considerably below average economic performance in the past decade could be attributed to this failure of the public sector. There is some evidence that the cutback and stagnation in public sector investment has been associated with a considerable decline in net foreign aid. It is suggested that unless the opportunity offered by the present happy position with regard to inventories of foodgrains and foreign exchange is exploited to push up public investment, long-term growth prospects of the economy may be seriously affected. Thus, a return to serious planning that was interrupted in 1966 is called for. It is hoped that the sixth plan would indeed be a plan unlike its two immediate predecessors.||T. N. Srinivasan,N. S. S.

This is because of the failure of direct taxes to mobilise a growing proportion of the incomes which have accrued to the rich. Considerable improvement in the system of Central taxation is possible and it can play an important role in reducing inequalities in the distribution of disposal incomes. For this certain far-reaching changes will be necessary. The thrust of these changes will have to be on enlarging the bases of direct taxes. This, to begin with, will require a bold and determined effort to do away with the various exemptions, reliefs, deductions and rebates which do not serve any socially useful purpose and which have the effect of reducing the progressiveness of these taxes. Second, efforts will have to be made to check the rapidly growing practice of indulging in conspicuous consumption financed through business. And third, a lot more will have to be done to unearth the tax-evaded incomes and wealth and to curb their generation and accumulation.||Anand P. Gupta

18/6/1977- ||special articles||4365703||Evaluation of India's Trade Policies||The criticism of the trade policies which have evolved in India since the Second Five-Year Plan has involved the proposition that India's industrialisation strategy has been incorrect and that the causes of the stagnation which the Indian economy is experiencing has to be located in the trade policies that have been followed. This criticism, if it is correct, has profound implications for our future strategies and programmes. This paper seeks to examine whether the evidence and analysis presented by the critics of Indian trade policies are adequate to warrant the conclusions drawn by them. Section I analyses the arguments and evidence in the framework of a simple analytical model and in Section II are discussed the trade policies in the context of other important issues related to India's economic development experience.||Vijay Laxman Kelkar

Efforts should be made, therefore, to understand the corporate development plans at the firm level and to influence these plans so that a long-term commitment is built in towards developing exports, and provision is made for the intensive marketing and other inputs that would be needed for producing the desired results. Future export policy should be based on integration of the export development plans of the larger manufacturing enterprises which are formulated within the broad framework of the objectives and priorities of the national export policy. This paper presents the results of a survey of the exports and future export plans of large Indian companies during the period 1970-75.||Charan D. Wadhva,G. R. Kulkarni

The need to overcome the effects of past discriminations through positive 'affirmative action' has however been recognised and given effect to in recent times through legislation and legal decisions. But these attempts at 'affirmative action' have at the same time come under attack as constituting 'reverse discrimination'. The problem of protective discrimination and the inherent contradiction between individual rights and the group categorisation which substantive equality may demand, over which the Supreme Court had deferred judgment some years ago in the case of DeFunis vs Odegaard and the University of Washington is once again before the Court in the case of Bakke vs the Regents of the University of California. Bakke, a White student, has charged the University of California authorities of practising 'reverse discrimination' by denying admission to him in the University Medical School at Davis while non-White applicants less qualified than him were admitted. The Bakke decision is expected to be the most significant in the area of race relations since the historic school desegregation ruling of the US Supreme Court in 1954. This article briefly traces the issues involved in the Bakke case and relates it to the earlier DeFunis case.||Robert L. Hardgrave,

However, the principle came under great strain during the later period of the regime of Indira Gandhi when the concept of a committed bureaucracy was sought to be given currency as being more suitable to Indian conditions. With the political changes that came about after the March and June 1977 elections at the Centre and in many of the states, the whole problem of the relation between the administrator and the politician has assumed new, and yet vaguely perceived dimensions. This article is an attempt to analyse these new challenges facing the Indian administrative and political system.||V. Subramaniam

The interesting thing about these takeovers has been the willingness with which the oil companies complied with the government's plans, a willingness quite contrary to what would normally have been expected from the Oil Majors, since in earlier periods these companies had put up stiff resistance to governmental 'interference' and consistently fought against attempts to break their monopoly over the Indian petroleum industry. This paper examines those changes in the international and Indian oil industry which are relevant to an understanding of the takeover of the oil companies.||Saumitra Chaudhury

Both the Janata election manifesto and the utterances of some of the prominent leaders of the party had raised expectations that the Budget would look different from its predecessors. However, it has come to pass that the present Budget breaks no new ground and conforms to the pattern set by the previous budgets. The Janata policy-makers have yet to make their position clear on some basic issues. They have also not given an operational content to some of their objectives like employment-generation. It is the lack of clarity on both these counts that has led to a Budget which lacks focus.||C. Rangarajan

The finance minister in his speech while presenting the interim budget, showed awareness of the need to rectify the fallacies of the budgetary policies pursued so far. He emphasised the adverse impact of excessive deficit financing and the need to review and recast Plan priorities. The suggestion to drastically cut the Plan outlay is, however, unwise. Instead the government should, and can, explore avenues of additional resource-raising. Some possibilities in this direction are discussed here.||K. A. Menon,M. R. Nair

It is difficult to understand, therefore, why the government should have entrusted the task of reviewing both these Acts to the same Committee. The task of the present Committee, it is suggested here, should be restricted to reviewing the Companies Act. But if it is to undertake even this task satisfactorily, the composition of the Committee will have to be changed to remove the pronounced bias in favour of big business and its terms of reference will have to be redrafted. A new and separate Committee needs to be constituted to review the MRTP Act, not in isolation but together with industrial licensing policy and policy for approval of foreign collaboration agreements. The constitution of such a Committee will, however, make sense only if the government makes clear its commitment to the objectives of control of concentration of economic power and monopolies, acceleration of the production of mass consumption goods, development of appropriate technology and reducing dependence on foreign technology and capital.||A.

Things, however, have been changing, and the changes have been most pronounced during the regime of Devaraj Urs. Certain deliberate (and occasionally crude) measures adopted by the Urs regime have been instrumental in undercutting the role of these traditional power centres. The result has been the emergence into political prominence of groups which had suffered from both Vokkaliga and Lingayat oppression. This article attempts to analyse some of these class and caste dynamics of the Urs regime.||James Manor

1/2/1977- ||the economic crisis||4365321||Towards an Explanation of Crisis in a Mixed Underdeveloped Economy||The mixed economy, in country after country, has come to face a crisis. The crisis is not temporary or cyclical, but one affecting the very viability of this type of economy. A situation inevitably arises when economic growth cannot proceed further within the framework of the mixed economy without creating enormous inflationary pressures. Inflation, of course, hits at the real living standards of the urban and rural proletariat and semi-proletariat; more important, however, from the point of view of the ruling classes, it hits at the petty bourgeoisie and, in particular, the crucial articulate segment of it, the professional groups and the salariat, and throws it into the camp of the opponents of the ruling classes. In the interests of the ruling classes, the state, therefore, attempts to control inflation by cutting back its investment and retarding the pace of economic expansion. Such retardation, of course, throws workers out of employment, especially in the capital goods industries; what is more important again from the ruling class point of view, however, is that it hits at the crucial segment of the urban petty bourgeoisie in another way - educated unemployment swells as jobs do not expand rapidly enough to absorb those, usually from a petty bourgeois background themselves, who are seeking professional, technical or bureaucratic careers. Besides, such retardation spells ruin for the petty producers and small capitalists and even has the effect of choking off some of the avenues of accumulation for the monopoly capitalists. The crisis of the mixed economy lies precisely in this predicament: a continuation of economic expansion within its framework creates serious problems for the ruling class; a discontinuation of economic expansion creates equally serious problems for the ruling class. This paper discusses the question why a mixed economy inevitably leads to a crisis.||Prabhat Patnaik,S. K. Rao

It has its use in formulating the intial propositions of a programme for agricultural development. If the propositions advanced in this paper are granted, then the present stage of agriculture in India may be described as one where though capitalism has come, the pre-capitalist mode is still prevalent and capitalist development is arrested primarily by the influence of imperialism. This suggests that the task immediately ahead is fundamentally one of full-scale capitalist development, of releasing the forces of capitalism in agriculture, to which the principal obstruction is passed by imperialism.||N.

10/9/1977- ||special article||4365916||Strategy of Export-Oriented Growth: A Theoretical Note||Use of export incentives to promote exports is typically justified by the following arguments: (a) That a rise in exports enables the existing production units in the exports sector to increase the rate of utilisation of capacity or to create fresh capacity through the additional demand for such goods from the foreign market. (b) That such a rise in export earnings enables the existing units of production in the domestic economy to create and utilise capacity by making it possible for them to make the necessary complementary imports from abroad. This paper examines the feasibility of an export-led growth process initiated by the State through a set of export-promotional devices.||Sunanda Sen

Though, as a consequence of the Act, legally induced abortions more than trebled between 1972-73 and 1974-75, the estimated total number of abortions in the country are more than four times the legally induced ones. This study was a preliminary attempt to understand why the vast majority of women do not go in for the facilities provided by government. The study suggested that, while lack of medical facilities and social stigma may be part of the reason for this, there is also a high rate of rejection of cases by the hospitals themselves. Further, it is usually women from the lower classes and inferior social backgrounds who account for a majority of the rejected cases.||N. Baskara Rao,Ramesh Kanabargi,Shantha Kanabargi

The findings of this study clearly indicate that these objectives have not been achieved. In fact, at many places resort to force to impose sterilisation has precipitated quite the contrary condition - a mass movement against the family planning programme. Even in a purely quantitative sense and presuming that government figures are reliable, achieving 3.8 million sterilisations in the first six months of 1975-76 is not quite as spectacular as is being projected by the government mass media. After all, a level of 3.1 million sterilisations was reached in 1972-73 when there was large-scale use of mass vasectomy camps. A clear lesson was then learnt that such an approach could not be sustained for long. The same question can be asked about the current intensified programme. Is it feasible to keep such intense pressure on the people and on the government functionaries for any length of time, or, even throughout 1976-77? Over and above this, there is the question of the demographic profile of the acceptors of family planning under duress. This study reveals that a substantial proportion of the acceptors belonged to demographically dubious classes. Preoccupation of the entire government machinery with attainment of sterilisation targets has led to a great neglect of the other components of the National Population Policy and indeed of the entire programme to improve the lot of the weaker sections of the population. The findings of this study make a strong case for switching back to the population policy enunciated by the government of India at the Bucharest Conference and in the draft Fifth Plan document of 1974. It will require basic structural changes in the government machinery, and a very great effort to regain its lost credibility, to effectively implement that policy.||D. Banerji

However, it is a matter of common experience that these changes are very difficult to implement, most of all because the privileged who have benefited from the old system are always there to do a lot of hair-splitting and to stall reforms. The central point of the new educational system recommended by the Education Commission and accepted by Parliament in 1968 is to make education an instrument of social change, to promote equality of educational opportunity and hence social justice, and to contribute towards national development. The present debate, however, seems to be about relatively minor matters such as the structure of 10+2+3, or whether +2 should be in schools or colleges or about the 'heaviness' of the courses - perhaps all because instead of social change, status quo or even status quo ante is uppermost in our minds.||Rais Ahmed

The first part of the paper critically examines some of the existing explanations of the decline of the rate of growth. The second part presents the alternative explanation. The empirical implication of this alternative hypothesis is then verified in part three.||Sudipto Mundle

Hence, the matter is very serious. That being the case, the manner in which the decision was taken not only seems casual, but also contradicts completely the government's promises of widening participation in, and decentralising, decision-making. The whole modus operandi does not augur well for the future. Further the decision has far-reaching implications detrimental to the government's professed objectives. Thus, both for the generation of appropriate technologies for rural development, as well as for the selective import of foreign technologies (in cases where this may be essential), followed up by the achievement of self-reliance in these technologies, it is vital to maintain and even strengthen the CSIR as a national, independent, inter-disciplinary, multi-institutional scientific agency. To dismantle it, as the government decision intends, is to jeopardise rural development on the one hand, and to aggravate urban-rural disparties, unemployment and technological, and therefore political, dependence on the other hand. This is not to imply that there is no room for improvement in the CSIR. There are a host of trivial problems solvable with trivial measures. The point is that the government's CSIR decision envisages major surgery for an ailment which only deserves a simple remedy. As a result, it is prescribing a cure which will be far worse than the disease. For this cure to be prevented, even at this late stage, it is vital that the conversion of scientists into "government servants" - an increasing trend over the past decades - does not inhibit the academies and scientific workers association from voicing their dissent and ensuring that science and technology serve the people.||Amulya Kumar N.

26/11/1977- ||review of management, november 1977||4366124||Role of Preference Shares in the Indian Corporate Sector||This paper discusses, against the background of the nature and limitations of preference shares, the reasons why the role of preference shares as a source of long-term capital has been relatively insignificant in recent years, and tries to examine whether the same factors will limit their use in future. Their hybrid nature seems to have brought more weaknesses than strengths to preference shares. They carry the promise of a fixed income like debentures but without the element of safety of the latter; they participate in the risks of ordinary shares without sharing in rising income during prosperous years. The low priority accorded to the preference shares in the financing plans of companies shows that this source has not been found productive by companies for raising long-term capital. Even the small issues of preference shares have not found acceptability with investors, a greater portion having had to be taken up by the financial institutions. The investment experience with preference shares shows that the benefits flowing from these are apparent and not real. This seems to be so for various reasons such as the performance of the Indian corporate sector, attempts by company managements to take undue advantage of the discretionary powers in the matter of dividend declaration and legal uncertainties in regard to voting rights. Urgent action has to be taken to stop preference shares from becoming further unpopular. Whatever the action contemplated by government or by financial institutions to strengthen these shares, consideration has to be given to the recent development in preference share issues which pointedly show that they have assumed the form more of fixed-creditor type of security.||Y.

An analysis of selected data over the period April 1961 to November 1973 shows that investment in equities has generally failed to act as a reliable hedge against inflation. In fact, investment in gold and silver, traditional 'frozen investment', has been a better hedge than investment in securities.||M. R. Mayya

It is, therefore, not altogether surprising that one of the principal thrusts of government action during the Emergency was to attack the independence of the judiciary and the destroy the balance of our Constitutional institutions. This article discusses the many forms - supersession, transfers and non-confirmation of judges, departure from established procedures for appointment of judges - the attack on the independence of the judiciary took and the impact of this attack. The author also suggests a procedure for placing the appointment and promotion of judges beyond direct and indirect executive influence.||Ashok H. Desai
