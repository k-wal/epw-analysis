03/12/1977- ||special articles||4366155||Opportunity to Face Basic Issues||The real ills of the present educational system are its elitist nature, its heavy pushout and dropout rate, its scandalously poor rural school environment, its growing unemployed and unemployable product outcome, its indifference to the 70 per cent adult illiterates and neglect of the special claims of first generation learners, its minimal learning and atrocious evaluation system, and its widening gap between the overt (prescribed) curriculum and the hidden (real) curriculum. Compared to these basic ills, which the new system provides an opportunity of bringing out into the open with the possibility of remedial action, the technical problems of how the 10-year school should be staged, where the +2 higher secondary stage should be placed and what kind of mix of general and vocational learning should be planned are of secondary significance. If the basic issues are dealt with, the technical problems can also be solved.||Malcolm S. Adiseshiah
