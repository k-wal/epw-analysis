Conceptualising the displacements in rhythmic terms, it first details the subversion of progressive land reforms and the reassertion of caste-based oppression, followed by the clash between the dharma of the spirits of the land and the neo-liberal dharma of capitalistic development. Finally, it looks at life in a resettlement colony where families that have been uprooted from the agricultural production cycle are closed off from the urban life they are expected to adopt.||IAN COOK,RAMACHANDRA BHATTA,VIDYA DINKER

One community, Mangar, is on the verge of losing the battle to the allure of real estate. The second village, Zir, is still confidently preserving the forest as its common property, and the third, Bhondsi, appears to be divided in interests and has decided to let the forest department do the protection for the immediate future. What do these three different trajectories tell us about conserving our forests?||P J DILIP KUMAR

This essay points out that government programmes have widened social disparities among the Reangs and brought in alternatives that cannot sustain them round the year. It argues that shifting cultivation, which aims at self-sufficiency, is still remunerative compared to other forms of cultivation if traditional forest and land rights are restored to the tribal people.||MAYURI SENGUPTA

In a majority of these studies, it is found that subjects tend to cooperate if they are allowed to communicate and make their own rules of use. In the context of the Forest Rights Act, 2006, a number of questions are being raised at public forums. Are communities capable of managing a valuable resource like a forest? Will transfer of authority not result in large-scale deforestation? Are traditional norms of sustainable harvesting still effective even after increased access to markets and commercialisation? This paper reports on the findings of four field experiments that evolved in the course of a study conducted in two indigenous communities in Maharashtra. Both of the communities have had past traditions of shared norms and mutual trust, and their behaviour in the experiments shows that the communities still tend to be non-exploitative, non-commercial, and cooperative for prioritising, planning, and managing resource sustainably.||RUCHA GHATE,SURESH GHATE,ELINOR OSTROM

In a country where hunting is illegal, it is not the final elimination of the animal, but the process of hunting which is a method of territorialising the animal and human audiences. As seen in two recent incidents of hunting man-eating leopards in north India, this process invokes anachronistic hunting imagery. Elimination of problem animals should be done without fuss and spectacle, so that larger wildlife conservation aims are not obfuscated.||NEHA SINHA

In a medieval war economy the smelter shared a relationship of mutual interdependence with the feudal state as a provider of critical raw material for weapon manufacture. This, however, changed with the advent of the colonial state, interdependence giving way to competition over resources. It is through this multilayered perspective of environmental and military history intertwined with the anthropology of iron smelting that we can unearth one of the roots of statutory forest laws.||SASHI SIVRAMKRISHNA,AMALENDU JYOTISHI

Since many of the practices of the Heraka are derived from Hinduism, the Sangh parivar has declared them to be vanvasi (forest-dwellers) and sought to assimilate them into the Hindu fold.

And, yet, while physical climate change receives a good deal of attention and research, economic climate change is seldom noticed and rarely commented upon. The sustained attack on Keynesian demand management in the name of "sound finance" has re-established the dominance of finance capital the world over, except in a few Latin American countries where social democracy has forced its way into policy in a new guise.

Cities, like living organisms, depend on external metabolic flows to keep them alive. Among all the metabolic flows of matter and energy none is more important than water — especially water used for meeting basic drinking water and other domestic consumption needs. This paper develops a metabolic framework for domestic water use in Bangalore, one of the fastest growing urban agglomerations in India. Our urban metabolism framework treats the city as a tightly-coupled social-ecological system and shows that a spatially explicit understanding of consumption patterns is crucial to addressing three central aspects of the water conundrum — equity, ecological sustainability and economic efficiency.||VISHAL K MEHTA,RIMI GOSWAMI,ERIC KEMP-BENEDICT,SEKHAR MUDDU,DEEPAK MALGHAN
21/12/2013- ||special article||24478403||The Nature of Economic Development and the Economic Development of Nature||This paper reviews and in part extends an emerging literature that integrates development and environmental thinking. It focuses on a small part of the literature: economic evaluation, and goes on to develop the notion of sustainable development and construct a unified language for sustainability and policy analyses. It is shown that by economic growth we should mean growth in wealth - which is the social worth of an economy's entire set of capital assets - not growth in gross domestic product nor the many ad hoc indicators of human development that have been proposed in recent years. The concept of wealth invites us to extend the notion of capital assets and the idea of investment well beyond conventional usage. The author also shows that by sustainable development we should mean development in which wealth (per head) adjusted for its distribution does not decline. This has radical implications for the way national accounts are prepared and interpreted. The author then provides an account of a recent publication that has put the theory to work by studying the composition of wealth accumulation in contemporary India. The study reveals that the entire architecture of contemporary development thinking is stacked against nature. These are still early days in the measurement of the wealth of nations, but both theory and the few empirical studies we now have at our disposal should substantially alter the way we interpret the progress and regress of nations.||PARTHA DASGUPTA

This paper uses the concept of ecology of choice in mate selection to demonstrate how different social processes and practices have ramifications on who can marry, who they can marry, and under what circumstances. It points to the historical and cultural practices of patrilineage, hypergamy, and concubinage, which contributed to a marriage squeeze long before the sex ratio at birth became an issue. It also examines how the policies of the Chinese Communist Party have affected social institutions related to marriage, reinforcing the marriage squeeze, and discusses the implications of this.||LISA EKLUND

For that, agriculture will have to grow at least 4% annually to support gross domestic product growth rates in excess of 8% if we are to constrain imports at slightly higher levels than at present. Such agricultural growth can be attained with a total factor productivity growth rate of 2%, along with developing the net irrigated area to 90 million hectares. But in the past two decades, agricultural growth has been less than 3% and productivity growth has been lower than 2%.

India's coal reserves are smaller than estimated and the flurry of coal-based power plants that have been approved in recent years has seen a frenetic rush to tie up coal resources, which at this rate would last no more than 20 years. Auction of mines is by itself no solution to the problems created by private allotment; auctions need to be carefully crafted and there should be production-sharing contracts monitored by a statutory regulator. Last but not the least, there is the issue of pollution and environment degradation caused by the mining and burning of coal. India needs a strategy based on demand management of energy, including introducing efficiency improvements in both the coal and the electricity sectors. It also needs to make a decisive shift in favour of renewable sources of energy. The country needs to move away from coal as quickly as possible.||E A S SARMA

As a colonial power, Britain ruled India primarily for its own benefit; at the same time, it had to address all the usual issues of urban governance, such as control of space, provision of water, sewerage, roads, street lighting and police. Naturally enough, the British often viewed Indian problems through the lens of Britain's experience in its own first era of rapid industrialisation, urbanisation, and popular democracy. India's conditions were, however, quite dissimilar and the immense size and diversity of India produced divergent policies in different regions and at various times. Even where policies may have been similar, their implementation and reception frequently varied. In England, efforts to plan towns effectively lacked sufficient funding and personnel; in India, these shortcomings were far more severe. Nevertheless, British planning bequeathed to India enduring legacies — positive and negative — in urban architecture, physical planning, and the administrative mechanisms of governance.||HOWARD SPODEK

Estimating the average level of ownership in 2025 at 35 per 1,000, this article points out that the growing number of cars has serious implications for energy security, air pollution, road safety, and equitable allocation of road space, and argues that there is an urgent need for India to learn from the experiences of cities that have decoupled car ownership from economic growth, and reduce the rate of growth of car ownership in India.||AKSHIMA T GHATE,S SUNDAR

Many man-made wetlands have been treated as naturally occurring, tanks have become lakes, and a large number of ponds have become nondescript entities. The number of inland wetlands estimated is far less when compared to other known sources of data, creating reasonable doubt on the reliability of the exercise. This article emphasises the need for releasing the complete geo-coordinates and areal data sets, and undertaking accurate assessments of the numbers and water spreads of tanks and ponds.||R SEENIVASAN
