01/8/1987- ||special articles||4377312||Towards a Theory of Transformation of Semi-Feudal Agriculture||Any attempt to theorise about issues related to the transformation of a sector of the economy in third world countries involves analysis of antagonistic contradictions at two levels. While the main global contradiction remains between the imperialists and the third world countries, those who want to struggle on the side of progressive forces to hasten the process of social transformation cannot afford to neglect the dialectics of the part. It is in this context that the analysis and understanding of the 'semi-feudal mode of production' in Indian agriculture assumes importance. Taking the case of Bihar, the author argues, with the help of a theoretical model, that in Bihar's agriculture the bulk of surplus value is even today appropriated from the direct producers through tenancy (specially sharecropping tenancy), usury and labour process (using non-free labour). Semi-feudal institutions operate as a drag on development and even primitive accumulation is not in evidence.||Pradhan H. Prasad

It has become conceptually less Eurocentric and more sensitive to regional nuances and to the internal dynamic of change. It has become less and less 'comparative' in the conventional sense of devoting undue attention to institutional structures, and increasingly aware of political, economic and social forces underlying their functioning or mal-functioning as the case may be. Finally, it has recently started to become more rooted in analysis based on empirical fieldwork and less preoccupied with theories and models for their own sake. These three major transformations have cut right through the division within the general field of European sociological scholarship between those who start with a weberian (and derived from it, a functionalist, behaviouralist, and quantitative) approach or framework on the one hand, and on the other, those whose starting point is some variant or other of a marxist perspective.||T.

But the task of destroying the pre-capitalist relations has entailed the generalisation of commodity production and of wage labour which have the tendency to perpetuate themselves; secondly, state power had to be captured if the immediate producers were to emancipate themselves and by the very nature of armed struggle against imperialism the old state machinery was destroyed. But the new state has not been a proletariat state; and, thirdly, nationalism proved a mighty weapon both to bring about a liquidation of the colonial domination as well as to create the broadest possible front against imperialist domination.||Paresh Chattopadhyay
30/5/1987- ||review of management, may 1987||4377043||Sengupta Report on Public Enterprises: Eloquent Fuzziness at Its Best||A number of major policy initiatives toward public enterprises are being pushed vigorously by the government. Phrases like "MOUs" "holding companies" and "privatisation" have become a part of the current economic jargon. A closer examination reveals that they have spawned out of a common source-the Arjun Sengupta Report on Public Enterprises. Yet, this Report has never been subjected to any debate. Primarily, because it has not yet been made public by the government. The present critique is based on an unauthorised publication of this Report. The author finds that it contains some excellent ideas; however, they are too few in number and the manner of presentation obscures their importance. This paper analyses each section of the Report to see the contradictions involved and the linkages between various issues. It singles out two recommendations for immediate implementation. First, the information base regarding public enterprises should be strengthened by installing an information system. Second, a system of performance evaluation, based on clear targets and linked to an incentive system should be implemented.||Prajapati Trivedi

Such speculation, however, betrays a serious lack of historical perspective. The present world economic crisis in fact began in the real economy with the decline in the rate of profit in the mid-1960s and the recessions of 1967 and 1969-70. The fifth recession in the development of this economic crisis since 1967 was approaching anyway in the natural course of events. Black Monday was one possible response to this development and it is now likely to accelerate and aggravate it still further.||Andre Gunder Frank

In Rajasthan which by 1968 had become one of highest poverty states the data show some distinct features. This paper examines the position of the generally identified rural poverty groups in the state in terms of the distribution of consumption expenditure, income, assets and liabilities as well as food consumption patterns for both all-rural population and the weaker sections. What emerges is that the consumption levels of a significant number of labour households are higher than those of other sections of the population; that rural labour households are not necessarily the poorer sections; and that in fact, small cultivators turn out to be the worst sufferers. This poses two questions: Does the categorisation of economic status on the basis of assets alone truly reflect economic welfare of rural masses presumed to be in poverty? Can it be concluded that there is not much poverty in the state because the calorie consumption of even those people on the lower rungs of the asset ladder is at worst only marginally lower than that of other generally identified better off sections?||Sushma Sagar,Kanta Ahuja,Vidya Sagar

How did the industrial system spread to other countries in the subsequent period? How large were the differences in the real per capita incomes between the pioneer industrial countries and what are now called the Third World countries? At what rate and over how long a period did the economic distance between these two areas grow? These questions are pertinent to assessing the prospects for several of the Third World countries catching up with the industrial pioneers. This essay attempts to examine these questions.||Surendra J. Patel

13/6/1987- ||special articles||4377099||Definition, Measurement and Determination of Money Supply||Money is one of the important macro economic variables. Correct understanding of the role of money in economic activity hinges on defining and measuring money correctly. There has been a growing tendency both in India and abroad to conduct monetary analysis and policy in terms of empirically defined broad money and multiple measures of money. Recently, the Committee to Review the Working of the Monetary System also has held that M3is the appropriate definition of money and that the money multiplier framework is dependable for money supply analysis and control. This would give a further wrong direction to the evolution of monetary theory and monetary policy as well as their information base in India. This paper seeks to undertake a fresh and comprehensive discussion of major issues relating the concept, measure, and determination of money supply with a view to restraining the tendency mentioned above. Section I examines which of the existing approaches to defining money is correct. Section II discusses the special economic characteristics of money, while section III presents a new measure of money supply for India in the light of these characteristics. Section IV examines whether and how far the money multiplier theory is empirically supported in India. [This paper has been published in two parts. Sections III and IV appear below.

When development planning was launched in the country it was assumed that in course of time the technical and professional cadres would overshadow the generalist administrators. But now when the political authority is anxious to dilute the role of the state in the development process and to strengthen instead its administrative and security functions, it is inevitable that the technical-professional cadres should be expected to play second fiddle to the bureaucrats.||B.

According to one point of view these workers are typical examples of what Lenin termed the labour aristocracy, a segment of the working class which, by virtue of its position in the economically more developed and politically most crucial sector of the world economy, is able to command higher wages. This in turn divides the working class, with one sector finding itself increasingly incorporated into a socio-mental system based on the rationality and ethics of MNCs and growing more and more remote from other groups in their own country. This article is based on a study designed to evaluate the relevance of this thesis in the context of the employees of Dutch MNCs in India. The study finds that the above thesis about workers in multinationals has to be rejected. The co-operation of a section of the workforce is, however, more probable in high-tech companies with a limited number of workers and super profits.||G. K. Lieten

It is quite sizeable relative to foreign direct investment into India and private corporate investment in India. It is also quite comparable with the magnitudes of foreign direct investment of the newly industrialising countries and some small developed capitalist countries. Foreign direct investment from India has grown steadily since the mid-sixties. However, there has been a distinct slackening of the rate of growth since 1979-81. The author is of the view that transnationalisation of the Indian private corporate sector is not too insubstantial. The Indian capitalist class has 'come of age' and is undertaking industrial ventures abroad in its drive towards capital accumulation. [This paper has been published in two parts.

Along with this has been a change in the sex ratios favouring females. While this is being generally seen as an indication of the improvement of health of women, a careful analysis of the sexwise changes in mortality patterns and of the health status of women and children belies this argument. For, although the life expectancy for females has improved, most of this gain has accrued to the older age groups. Moreover, the continuing high rates of infant mortality, especially in the perinatal period, and the large proportion of low birth weight babies with poor chances of survival is a clear indication of the poor health of women in India.||Malini Karkal

A Comparative Analysis of Sugar Co-operatives in India||The co-operative sugar factories of western India (in Maharashtra state) are remarkably successful examples of local development initiative. This paper presents a comparative sociological analysis of these co-operatives in order to pinpoint the organisational factors which are crucial for their success. Comparative analysis of privately-owned sugar factories in India reveals a basic weakness in the cane supply relationship between the private factories and the surgarcane growers-a weakness which the co-operative factories have overcome. As a result, the co-operatives can operate at higher technical and economic efficiency than the private factories. Moreover, although the co-operatives receive some helpful subsidies from the government, much larger subsidies are directed to the private factories at the expense of the more efficient co-operatives. The success of the co-operative sugar factories depends not only on a superior cane supply system (which resolves a problem specific to the sugar industry), but also on their ability to generate a stable alliance among the small, medium and large cane growers who are the shareholders. This alliance is made possible by two sets of factors: internal factors, which are specific to the technical requirements of sugar production; and external factors, which are rooted in the agrarian system of the region where these co-operatives have flourished. Comparisons with other types of co-operatives in other regions of India show that the presence or absence of similar factors determines whether a given type of co-operative will succeed or fail. Detailed comparisons with the successful dairy co-operatives of Gujarat show that co-operative alliances between small and large farmers may take different organisational forms under different regional conditions. Political organisation is also influenced by the nature and scale of the production process. The general conclusion is that the probable success or failure of co-operative organisations can be predicted through such comparative analyses-analyses which compare co-ops with other types of private and co-operative enterprises, taking into account (a) the technical and organisational requirements of the production process, (b) the distribution of interests and possibilities for a stable alliance among the members, and (c) the regional agrarian systems which determine the natural and social environments of the co-operatives.||D.

It argues that in the context of rural India, a proper understanding of the production, consumption and reproduction of energy requires the extension of the concept of energy beyond fuels to include food, fodder and fertiliser. Using labour, land, physical and monetary assets, indebtedness and caste as the principal tools of analysis, and on the basis of the field surveys conducted by the authors in 1986, this theoretical and empirical study examines how the energy situation-defined now to comprise fuel, food, fodder and fertiliser-has evolved and is evolving among the rural middle class, the small peasant class and the wage labour class (defined to include marginal peasants). These three broad rural social classes account respectively for twenty, thirty-five and forty-five per cent of the rural population. The study reveals that while there is no energy crisis for the rural middle class, and the small peasant class is constantly balancing itself on the edge of the energy crisis, the wage labour class finds itself deep in a chronic and unremitting state of energy crisis. The details of the energy situations of these three classes are presented, and both the exploitative and non-exploitative relations between them are explored.||M. R. Bhagavan,S. Giriappa

The thrust of the author's argument may be stated as follows: property is a set of social relations. Embedded in these are social behaviour and gender relations. Since the capacity to act is circumscribed to a large extent by the forms of familial, conjugal and kinship relations, the degree of women's independence in rural Bangladesh is problematic. Belonging to a subordinate gender, women are less free to act as subjects with regard to people and to things, hence to property.||B. K. Jahangir

More specifically, IRDP remains weak as thrust for widening the base of rural economy through substantial addition of non-agricultural activities. (b) In terms of a number of implementation, acceptability and impact criteria, IRDP in Karnataka can be regarded as reasonably effective. (c) However, the land-linked schemes form the major component of IRDP activities. Village industries and service schemes are not only small in number but they absorb only the households having these activities as their traditional occupations and not categories like landless labourers whose need for self-employment opportunities are more pressing. As a consequence, the impact of IRDP in terms of diversification of rural economy remains very modest. The enduring benefits of the Programme go to a few households having a land-base and only the poor relatively close to the poverty-line manage to cross it. (d) These characteristics of IRDP derive from the features of the national economy and its ruling elites posing rigid barriers to a diversified and growth-oriented rural economy.||V. M. Rao,S. Erappa

21/2/1987- ||special articles||4376708||Urbanisation and Rural Change in West Bengal||The particular pattern of urbanisation in West Bengal-the overwhelming role of the primate city, the wide gap between the former and the other major cities in the region in terms of population size, economic activities and cultural influence, and the predominantly rural character of the other areas in the region-is distinct from the alternative pattern of decentralised urbanisation one sees in Punjab, Haryana, Kerala and some other states. The author argues that this contrasting pattern of urbanisation has a great deal to do with the differing land tenure systems, the colonial economic policies pursued by the British, and the course followed in terms of economic development in these two types of areas during the post-independence period. Section I of the paper deals with definitional and conceptual problems relating to various types of urban areas, and presents a historical account of the evolution of the present pattern of urbanisation. In Section II the present pattern of urbanisation is analysed and some case studies are introduced. Section III deals with the impact of urbanisation on rural areas, and in Section IV the impact of urbanisation on urban areas has been considered. Section V puts forward a particular strategy for urbanisation which emphasises decentralised urban growth with a rural focus.

31/1/1987- ||review of political economy, january 1987||4376618||Surplus, Accumulation and Growth||History of economic thought has been marked by both continuity and change. Insofar as economics as a discipline is not concerned with an undifferentiated and unhistorical reality, change is to be expected. It is the continuity-change combination which is a matter of interest and is indicative of the fact that the core of bourgeois thought is essentially ahistoric. The intermeshing of continuity and change in varying proportions has often had a retrogressive effect and the so-called 'revolutions' in economic theory have been followed by 'counter-revolutions' at the level of both thought and practice. The recent work of Roemer presents the continuity-change combination in a peculiar form. His reliance on the tools of 'rational choice models' while seeking to develop a general theory of exploitation (and class) gives us Marx not only without labour theory of value but also without history. Roemer's work has already called forth a number of critical comments. His work would, however, warrant another type of response-a fresh 'look-back' not only at Marx but also at the classical economists. Though provoked by Roemer's work, the present paper is not concerned with his model. It is designed to reappraise the relevance of classical political economy for the contemporary problems of the developing economies.||K. R. Ranadive

The view that emerges is that these programmes suffer primarily from a lack of conceptional clarity and an inadequate understanding of the complex nature of the environment in which they have to be implemented. It is thus the programme design which needs to be reviewed, taking into account the implications of the 'environmental' factors and carefully assessing the 'capacity' of the administrative machinery that is available. Greater clarity about the objectives and goals of each programme, the norms and other criteria for project selection, as well as role specificity of the different levels in the organisational structures involved in executing the programmes-all aspects of more systematic programme planning and design-would go a long way in giving the anti-poverty programmes at least a chance of success.||Sandeep Bagchee

The real growth, however, has been in the services sector which today has become the lead sector. It is in this sector that the under-reporting of income is also substantial and therefore the growth rate officially given is less than the actual. The rapid growth in the services sector is not linked to the new economic policy package but to the growth of the black economy. These two, the services sector and the black economy, are in turn crucially linked to the rising share of the surplus in the economy in the form of rent, profits, dividends and interest payments. It is in rising share of the surplus in the economy and the government's inability to mobilise it for investment that the major dilemma of the economy lies. The budget and the government policies have contributed in a substantial way both to the growth of the surplus in the economy and its not being mopped up for investment.||Arun Kumar

The findings reported in the earlier papers covered several aspects of the people's level of living-private consumption, social consumption, housing conditions and stocks of consumer durables. The present paper presents a summary of the people's responses to questions on their own perceptions of changes in different dimensions of their level of living.||Nikhilesh Bhattacharya,Manabendu Chattopadhyay,Ashok Rudra

1/5/1987- ||special articles||4377005||On the Inflationary Impact of Budget Deficit||There is no simple rule to assess the impact of deficit financing. A good deal regarding the scale and composition of the Budget must be known before its inflationary potential can be analysed. The paper examines the complexities of assessing the impact of deficit financing in the Indian context, and is intended to serve as a guide for such exercise. In the latter part of the paper the author illustrates the principal conclusions of the foregoing discussion by examining the inflationary potential of the current 1987-88 central budget, keeping in mind the fact that the exercise would of necessity be incomplete in the absence of detailed data and of reliable estimates of coefficients entering into sectoral demand and supply relations. He finds that from an aggregative analysis along neo-Keynesian lines the current budget cannot be said to have much of an inflationary potential. However at the disaggregative level, a number of factors which are likely to raise prices in the short run and make the economy inflation-prone in the long run can be identified.||Mihir Rakshit

It is clear, however, that the simple market structure-innovation paradigm is not enough. Technical knowledge is tacit, cumulative and firm-specific; hence not easily replicable or transferable. A large part of technological change activity in developing country firms can be accounted for by the need to assimilate and adapt imported technology to local conditions. Given its primacy in the industrialisation process, it is necessary to know why some firms or countries are more successful as managers of technological change than others.||Sanjay Kathuria

In fact the patriarchal bias of the social and the legal system gives rise to the assumption that once the men of the family have land, the women's needs are automatically taken care of. This study attempts to place the issue of the denial of land rights to Ho tribal women in the context of women's daily lives, work, struggle for survival and status in the family and community.

This paper briefly discusses the back-ground of Indian economic policy and planning as also recent developments in the process of economic growth and structural change in order to outline the framework in which industrial policy operates. There have been a number of interesting changes in the structure of industry. While priority to exports at the current stage of development is accepted, the author argues for the adoption of industrial policies which will provide productive employment, lead to a more regionally balanced economy and introduce higher levels of technological dynamism. The author also makes a case for the adoption of vigorous planning policies in order to bring about a structural transformation of the economy.||Yoginder K. Alagh

By focusing on the demographic-economic linkages the author tries to relate the discussion to the larger debate regarding the status of demography in historical explanations of change. This paper is divided into three sections. Section I discusses some of the representative works regarding the location of the demographic variable among the multiplicity of determinants in a social formation. Section II is a note on the area, the data base and demographic movements. In Section III the interrelations between demographic change and other historical processes are examined. Finally, some tentative conclusions are advanced on the determinants and mediating structures of demographic change.||R. Gopinath

Hundreds of community radio stations, also called public radio or free radio stations are in operation in the US, Canada, Australia, Italy, France, UK, Belgium and in the Nordic countries. While the rise of community broadcasting in western Europe marks a stage of capitalism when the state can afford to tolerate and contain decentralised initiatives the community radio is a good example of how new technologies can be used to advantage to challenge the dominant mode of communication. The article reviews the role and performance of community radio particularly in Norway, where it was first introduced on an experimental basis in 1981. Mainly used by christian groups in the beginning, the neighbourhood radio as it is known there, has been used effectively by minority immigrant groups as well as feminists not only maintain a communication flow from the majority to the minorities but also to disseminate ideas that are unlikely to be communicated by the mainstream media.||S.

02/5/1987- ||special articles||4376992||Structure of Working Class in India||India is a multi-structural economy where a number of pre-capitalist relations of production co-exist with capitalist, specifically imperialist relations. Corresponding to this multi-structural economy is a differentiated working class structure-the varied circuits of production, consumption and accumulation combine to produce a variety of forms of existence of the working class. The working class in India can be divided into four broad sections: (1) that which gets more than a family wage, i e, more than the value of labour power; (2) that which gets a wage about equal to the family wage and can thus at a reasonable standard cover the full cost of production and reproduction of labour power; (3) that which is more or less able to cover the immediate costs of production of labour power, but has to depend on the non-capitalist sector in order to reproduce itself and/or has to depress its standard of living in order to reproduce itself; and (4) the pauperised section that is not even able to meet the immediate cost of production of labour power. While the wage demands of the upper section of the workers are, of course, to be supported, yet in the sphere of economic demands it is the demands of the contract and casual labour that are important. The advancement towards a wage that covers the cost of labour power, regulation of working hours, ending of various forms of constraints and bondage, and security of employment are the major issues for the lower sections of the working class. In taking up the demands of the most exploited section of the workers, however, it is easy to be lulled by the reformist illusion that such endeavour is by itself revolutionary. This economic struggle must be linked with a central, political point-that even in order to earn a wage covering the cost of production and reproduction of labour power, it is necessary to put an end to the feudal and other pre-capitalist survivals and to break the imperialist stranglehold. The composition of the working class is further affected by (1) the caste, tribal or ethnic origins of the worker in the pre-capitalist sector; and (2) the gender-based division of labour between male and female and the associated patriarchy. The revolutionary trade union movement must also take up the question of these inequalities within the working class related to caste, ethnicity and gender. Some may hold that to take up these sectional issues would divide the working class. But in fact the opposite is true: working class solidarity cannot develop when these sectional issues of the most oppressed are ignored.||Dev Nathan

The article is a report of a study investigating the relationship between pesticides and physical disabilities in India. A few studies in India have shown a relationship between green revolution technologies in agriculture and physical disabilities-the presence of equipment such as tractors, threshers, etc, has been positively correlated with amputations. However, the incidence of limb and visual deformities and dysfunction of joints, etc, cannot be explained by the extent of use of mechanical implements alone. The study finds some evidence that pesticides, which are known to cause congenital deformities in animals, may well be a causative factor in limb and visual disabilities and suggests that the use in India of pesticides banned in other countries be abandoned.||Dinesh Mohan

The new stance of the state which appeared with the slogan of 'garibi hatao' is aimed at preventing the rural poor from further sliding into poverty with a further decline in their purchasing power. This shift in strategy enables the ruling class to evolve programmes and policies which will appease selected fragments of the poor temporarily, and to divide them by offering specific relief measures to selected target groups and thus diffuses the rising upsurge of the rural masses. It is therefore, misguided to attribute the limitations of the rural development programme to a 'lack of political will'. On the contrary, the 'political will' of the ruling classes is strongly biased in favour of the propertied classes, and by its very logic will become increasingly more fierce in suppressing movements of the poor.||A.

This paper tries to make explicit the fiscal strategy that underlies the budget and to see the directions being set as we move into the twenty-first century.

In the following three decades, the situation worsened. Between 1921 and 1931 working class housing increased by less than five per cent aggravating the situation. The chawls, some owned by the government, others by the mills and nearly half of them belonging to private landlords, were mostly rickety structures which often collapsed, injuring and killing the residents. Quarrels at the water tap leading to violence and murders was a feature of urban working class lives, as were such practices of landlords as rack renting, pagdi, the use of musclemen, etc. In 1935 the Congress Socialist Party helped to form the first working class tenants' union which took up various issues such as rent assessment standards, rent waivers during periods of high unemployment and even demanded free housing for the working class. Though the union functioned until 1945, it was not successful in mobilising large numbers.||Radha Kumar

This depression was more acute in Surma valley than in upper Assam. To cut expenses and avoid bankruptcy many planters retrenched their labour force and introduced short workings for those retained. The disappointment of the worker was great, and specially so when he saw what was happening to the local railway employees who had obtained a wage rise after successful strike action. Strikes and other industrial action were not unknown to the tea workers of Assam. After the war these protest movements were more carefully organised. This was possible because of a number of influences: the recent increase in immigration of workers from the UP where political activities were becoming increasingly important; a number of workers were converted Christians and thus more literate and able to keep contact with their homeland where also there was political unrest; a number of missionaries and Bengali clerical staff provided organisational help; the victories of the neighbouring railway workers provided inspiration. In the post-war period, Assam was no longer a remote region; there was much movement of workers from Assam to other parts of India, and many of them were becoming aware of opportunities elsewhere. These developments, favourable to a workers' movement, can be taken as sufficient explanation of the 'exodus' from the Chargola valley. There is little direct evidence to suggest that the trekking was planned by the Congress non-cooperators as part of their political campaign against the British government.||Kalyan K. Sircar
28/3/1987- ||review of agriculture, march 1987||4376842||Further Evidence on the Impact of Dairy Development Programme||The impact of dairy development on nutrition and income has been a matter of great interest to policy-makers. At the same time it has been a subject of fierce controversy both in popular press as well as academic journals. The proponents of the dairy development programme feel that such activity does indeed raise the level of income and hence, the nutrition of the rural poor. As such the dairy development programme needs to be encouraged through positive government policy. In contrast its critics assert that spread of dairying in rural areas is leading to transfer of items of nutrition from the rural poor to the well-to-do in the urban areas. Even otherwise the contribution of dairy development programmes to incomes in rural areas is marginal. The present study attempts to examine the following hypotheses: (i) Dairy development has positively contributed towards the improvement of the economic and nutritional status of the rural areas; (ii) The lower income groups in rural areas derived positive benefits from dairy development in terms of food intake and income; (iii) There has been a shortage of fodder in rural areas with dairy development programmes because of lack of integration of dairy development with other economic activities needed to support dairying.||B.

These labourers mostly belonged to the pulaya and the paraya castes who became apparently 'free' after the abolition of slavery in 1855. The prevalence of this system even during the early period of capitalist investment in agriculture can be explained by several factors not least of which is the characteristic form of highly labour intensive cultivation in the region known as punja cultivation and the fact that pulayas and the parayas were alone engaged in the hardest and the dirtiest of tasks involved. So firm was the grip of this feudal system that the attached labourers were slow to unionise. However, it was the labour movement which contributed significantly to the transition from attached labour to free labour.||Alex George

The SIT Act did not seek to abolish prostitutes or prostitution per se and hence the practice of prostitution individually, independently and voluntarily by a women did not constitute an offence. However, certain sections of the Act conceived of the prostitute as an offender and criminalised the prostitute. The SIT Act was sexist in its conception and formulation. It was based on the premise of man's aggressive and uncontainable sexuality and polygamous nature, considered 'natural and biological', giving rise to prostitution. Prostitution thus preserved the famly structure and prevented rampant rape. Paradoxically, while tolerating the institution of prostitution, women providing the service were socially castigated. Stree prostitutes were harassed to preserve a hypocritical veneer of morality and public decency, while prostitution behind closed doors was ignored. This paper presents the findings of a study of the implementation of the SIT Act during the years 1980-86 in Bombay, as a major centre of urban prostitution.||Jean D'Cunha

To achieve this objective, the ministry of industry commissioned a Review of the working of the Small Industry Development Organisation (SIDO) to recommend how it should be restructured to respond to the needs of the industry and the priorities laid down in the Seventh Plan. Based on exclusive field visits to as many as 20 states and discussions with a wide cross section of persons involved, it has been recommended to limit the scope of the SIDO to the larger, modern small units in the semi-urban and metropolitan regions, leaving the 'tiny' sector to the re-constituted Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC). A Small Industry Commission is proposed for more effective interaction with industry. A chain of National Technology Centres may be established to deal with the emerging problems of the small industry. Special attention to be given to the backward regions of the country where small industry can make a good impact. Suitable personnel policies are suggested to give the staff of SIDO a sense of participation and involvement.||Ram K. Vepa

It is quite sizeable relative to foreign direct investment into India and private corporate investment in India. It is also quite comparable with the magnitudes of foreign direct investment of the newly industrialising countries and some small developed capitalist countries. Foreign direct investment from India has grown steadily since the mid-sixties. However, there has been a distinct slackening of the rate of growth since 1979-81. The author is of the view that transnationalisation of the Indian private corporate sector is not too insubstantial. The Indian capitalist class has 'come of age' and is undertaking industrial ventures abroad in its drive towards capital accumulation. [This paper is being published in two parts.

The current countrywide strike by college and university teachers has to be seen as a part of this turmoil caused by bureaucracy's colonial hang-up of being the cream of society.

In the wording of the terms of reference what were guidelines to the previous commissions have been made directions to the Ninth Commission by the use of the phrase 'the Commission shall'. This is a curtailment of the discretion of the Finance Commission which goes against the provisions and spirit of Article 280 of the constitution. The Finance Commission is a constitutional body meant to judge certain issues regarding devolution of finances from the union to the states. The union, therefore, is one of the parties to the issues which the commission has to adjudicate and as such it cannot by itself issue a direction in regard to the manner in which the commission is to approach its constitutional task. The terms of reference of the Ninth Commission are thus further evidence of the tendency on the part of the government of India towards increasing centralisation and growing insensitivity to the problems of the states.||B.

In the last century they have become increasingly landless and have experienced a number of other socio-economic changes. This paper examines the interrelations between social processes that generate a continuity in the cultural ideas about gender and those that induce significant changes in other aspects of the female-male relationship. Changes in the rural production system are identified as interacting with gender organisation at household, kin-group and community level and the organisation of inter-ethnic relations. For example the mohila sikkar, the women's hunt, is an outcome of and response to the long-term changes in female-male dynamics. Through the organisation of the event women have successfully managed to put under public discourse the legitimacy of the current transformations in gender relations.||Tone Bleie

These estimates coupled with the estimates of domestic product provide data on capital-output ratios which are vital for the planning process. The estimates of gross capital stock minus the consumption of fixed capital based on the Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM) and age of various types of assets give the estimates of net fixed capital stock. These estimates of net fixed capital stock at given point of time provide the correct picture of the replacement value of the capital stock. At present in the National Accounts Statistics (NAS) the consumption of fixed capital is based mostly on the depreciation provision in the accounts of enterprises or ratios based on some bench-mark surveys. It has been felt that these estimates are on the lower side and need to be based on the estimates of capital stock using PIM. This paper presents estimates of net fixed capital stock and of consumption of fixed capital for the years 1980-81 to 1982-83. It is shown that in case estimates of consumption of fixed capital based on PIM are used in the official estimates, then the net rates of capital formation and saving would need to be revised downward by about 3 per cent.||Jagdish Kumar,R.

The caste composition of the local government leadership does not seem to have significantly changed. The two dominant landowning castes, the lingayats and the vokkaligas, dominate as in the past, while the non-dominant backward castes have been able to maintain their strength, however insignificant compared to their shares in the state's population. When, however, the totality of the resources which generally make up the political capacity of an adhyaksha is considered, the hold of the major castes in the governance of the zilla parishads is likely to be enormous. In the absence of the Janata government's will and ability to break the stranglehold of 'semi-feudalism' in the countryside of Karnataka, the newly created powerful system of democratic decentralisation is unlikely to create substantial gains for the rural poor.||Amal Ray,Jayalakshmi Kumpatla

The paper concludes that there is a serious problem of resource mobilisation. Increased outlays on defence may be justified on grounds of national security. But periods of national insecurity are also periods of tightening of belts and increased efforts at resource mobilisation. This is altogether missing in the budget. While the expenditure projections of the LTFP have received a severe knock, our resource mobilisation efforts still continue to be constrained by the LTFP.||V. N. Kothari

Further, the conditions in the housing market are conducive to the shifting of the tax to the consumers of housing. Estimates of the elasticity of housing services with respect to income suggest that the residential property tax possesses built-in regressivity. The tax in Calcutta is much more regressive than what the income-rent relationship would suggest. It is only through tax rate changes and efficient administration that the regressivity can be reduced or progressivity introduced. For the tax to be fair and to be closely related to the services it supports, the assessment disparities should be minimised and tax rates should be so structured as to generate tax demands according to the ability to pay.||Shyam Nath

What is presented is a study of trends, with the focus on works which have played a significant role in the intellectual history of the discipline.||Claude Markovits

The effect of HYV technology (HYV seeds, chemical fertiliser, irrigation) and mechanisation (tractors, combine harvesters, etc) on employment is reviewed separately for crop production over the year and for individual crops. An attempt is made to identify the impact of technology on employment of labour according to size of holding, composition of labour (family/hired, male/female) and seasonality. Labour absorption in allied agricultural and non-agricultural activities is also explored. This is followed by an attempt to analyse the links between the growth of agricultural output and employment. [This the concluding part of the paper which is published in two parts. The first part appeared last week.]||Rakesh Basant

Estimates of optimal price structures for public electricity supply in India are made using data from different sources. The estimates show that electricity should be sold at subsidised prices for both final consumption and intermediary input uses in India. However, the rate of subsidy should be less for intermediary input uses in relation to final consumption uses of electricity. Optimal price structures also indicate a marked trade-off between consumption efficiency and distributional equity objectives.||M. N. Murty

This study which examines the involvement of women-both labourers and landowning-in rice production in three states, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal finds that their contribution is neither marginal nor insignificant. Through their work, knowledge and skills both categories of women make crucial contributions to the production and processing of rice as well as to household expenditure. They are also aware of technological changes and influence their acceptance or rejection. But in order that their role be recognised many concepts and definitions including those of work, employment, wages, earnings, etc, have to be revised.||K. Saradamoni

In Karnataka, vast natural forests have almost disappeared to provide fuel and raw material for a number of old and new industries. The Karnataka government has undertaken a systematic programme of reforestation with single-stand eucalyptus plantations in these areas which have been cleared of natural forests. This article examines the social forestry programme of the Karnataka government which was introduced at about the same time as the land reforms were being implemented and draws attention to the fact that the programme has resulted in small and marginal farmers abandoning foodgrain cultivation not out of choice but out of the inability to grow these crops in lands surrounded by eucalyptus plantations.||D.

With the above issues in mind, the author studies the nature of interactions and processes that exist amongst four government departments at the district level. The departments selected are irrigation, public works, police, and administration, the last comprising the revenue, magistracy and community development functions under the district magistrate. The districts themselves are from Uttar Pradesh. Two of the districts regularly experience natural calamities in the form of floods or droughts, whereas the other two have fewer such experiences. The logic of so selecting the districts is to examine whether, under pressures created by the environment, the departments experienced any significant shifts in the patterns of their interaction.||Anil Chaturvedi

However, in the process some inequities have been introduced in the tax treatment of different components of housing (land and building), new and old housing stock, type of housing unit (plotted unit and apartment unit), building agency, etc. It is necessary to remove these anomalies. The inclusion of repayment of housing loans under section 80C should be re-examined and instead deduction for housing loans should be provided under a separate section of the Incometax Act, preferably merging the interest and capital components. Alternatively, a superior method would be to grant an investment allowance under which a specified per cent of housing cost should be deductible from the tax base over a seven-year period, subject to monetary ceilings on total deduction and annual deduction.||Vinay D.

On the contrary, it only serves their more basic political and ideological needs.

The Comprehensive Health and Development Project, Pachod has been experimenting with a number of ways of raising finances for health care from the community since 1977.

This paper focuses on (a) how the terms of trade between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors have moved since early fifties, (b) what has been the impact of adverse or favourable terms of trade on the rate of growth of agricultural output in different periods, and (c) what has been the impact of movement of terms of trade on demand for non-agricultural commodities by the agricultural sector. The analysis leads to the conclusion that movement of net barter terms of trade can have significant impact on the pace of investment in the agricultural sector as well as on the rate of growth of agricultural output. However, the impact of terms of trade turning adverse to the agricultural sector on the growth of investment in agriculture and on its output can be neutralised, to a great extent, through technological developments.||D.

That was the first major occasion when an important industrial power clearly admitted that contractionary balance of payments policies were neither desirable nor sustainable for an orderly evolution of the international economic system and that, for achieving medium-term viability, balance of payments adjustment policies in developing countries must ensure a reasonable and sustained economic growth.

That irrigation lowers farm instability is found in nine out of eleven states. For all the eleven states taken together, the coefficient of variation of detrended output is 5.4 per cent for the irrigated segment as against 11.4 per cent for the unirrigated segment. Quite expectedly, the stability gain in yield due to irrigation is much more than the corresponding stability gain in crop area. It is in the two high rainfall states of Bihar and Madhya Pradesh that irrigation fails to show any moderating influence on agricultural instability.||B. D. Dhawan

24/1/1987- ||special articles||4376593||Development of Sociology in India: An Overview||Sociology and social anthropology succeeded in establishing themselves as disciplines in India in the years following the end of World War I, despite an unfavourable academic environment. The academic elite in pre-independence Inida had all the prejudices of their colonial masters; sociology was looked down upon by British-trained or British-oriented Indian academics because British academics looked down upon it. The prejudice against anthropology went even deeper. Nationalist Indians felt that to be studied by anthropologists was to be condemned as primitives. Also, in nationalist circles, anthropologists, usually non-Indians, were associated with the view that tribals should be kept isolated from the mainstream, and this was regarded as a part of the wider policy of 'divide and rule' of the British rulers. The atmosphere for the social sciences changed noticeably in the years following independence. The new Indian state's commitment to economic development through centralised planning, its banning of the practice of untouchability and the introduction of measures for protective discrimination in favour of the untouchables and tribals, and in a lesser way, of the other socially and educationally backward classes, made it an ally of the social sciences, including sociology and social anthropology. One of the signs of the progress achieved in sociology and social anthropology is to be found in the increasing tendency towards specialisation. Apart from the older division of sociology into rural, urban and industrial sociology, new areas have rapidly established themselves, viz. political sociology, sociology of kinship, sociology of professions, developmental sociology and women's studies, to name a few. In each of these areas, the best work has combined careful empirical work with theory so that the two form a single, seamless whole.||M. N. Srinivas

The requirements of developing human resources-catering to large numbers of clients who are geographically dispersed with a variety of programmes-is an information-intensive activity. Development also requires a decentralised concept of working which will be facilitated, and reinforced, with the use of microcomputers by administrators at the local level, rather than limit computerisation to EDP cells at headquarters. The user needs can be served quite adequately by the standard software that i freely available.

21/2/1987- ||special articles||4376707||Income Tax Concessions, Savings and Interest Rates||This paper attempts to examine the process by which the income tax base is being eroded. A major narrowing of the tax base is occurring in the name of tax concessions as incentives for savings. What is new in the recent spate of tax concessions is the vast expansion of the scope of these concessions in terms of the exempted amounts and the variety of financial instruments which are eligible for such concessions. By extending the tax exemptions to the principal amount invested in particular forms of financial savings, the government has resorted to a costly and inequitous method of borrowing. A full or partial exemption of interest income would have been enough. With marginal income tax rates considerably reduced, with monetary interest rates raised above the inflation rate and with the policy objective of keeping the inflation rate under control, instead of multiplying tax concessions on savings the time has come to restrict them, the author argues.||V.

The CSIR has suffered through tailoring its programmes, policies and personnel towards helping in the government's former policies of 'import substitution'. The government can change its policies overnight but an R and D organisation would need time and effort to restructure and reorient itself. A government-funded and managed organisation is ill-suited to generate industrial production technologies or their absorption, adaptation and development. The strength of such an organisation lies in picking up long-term problems, watching future trends in science and technology and making its contribution in the emerging newer scientific and technological vistas. The CSIR is well-equipped to take up the back-up responsibility in areas of social relevance like environment and housing, etc, and for such laboratories the government departments/ministries concerned could lay down the programmes and participate in the management function. For such a role, it would be an advantage for the CSIR not to be too closely integrated with the economic and industrial policies (or their sudden shifts, twists and turns) but keep its distance and pick and choose areas where it may make the maximum contribution and impact.||Baldev Singh

1/5/1987- ||special articles||4377015||Education in China: From the Cultural Revolution to Four Modernisations||Despite some commendable efforts to democratise education, the Cultural Revolution was bogged down by the inability of the leadership to develop an alternative vision of higher education that would take into account the broader socio-political goals simultaneously with the economic compulsions of a major world power that China already was. Out of this ineptitude grew the authoritarian trend culminating in the repression of intellectuals. The succeeding leadership seems to have exploited these weakness to launch a very different socio-economic order that promotes inequalities at many levels, including the field of education. While committed to the slogan of accelerated growth all round, its achievements in the sphere of education are mixed. The restoration of the status quo ante in higher education and the promotion of postgraduate studies are positive steps, but quite insufficient. The savage cutback in secondary education is thoroughly unjustified. The reintroduction of an examination-centred system and of keypoint schools are controversial from an educational view point and retrograde from a democratic perspective. Section I of the present essay provides a statistical overview of the educational scene in China since 1952. Section II discusses in turn the educational model put forward by the Cultural Revolution, the actual measures taken, and the major drawbacks thereof. In Section III are described the more important ones among the recent changes in educational practice; the underlying reasons as well as the consequences of these changes are also explored critically. A few tentative conclusions are drawn in Section IV.||Nirmal Kumar Chandra

If you assume that the current underlying rate of inflation persists-and this rate is now 7.2 per cent according to the latest Economic Survey-then central plan outlay in this budget has been reduced compared with last year's by 3 per cent in real terms in the aggregate. When you look at the breakdown of this aggregate, it turns out that the cuts in the productive sectors of the economy are much more serious than the aggregate figures suggest. Together with the choice made among possible instruments for raising revenue, the expenditure profile of the 1987-88 budget is likely to retard the real rate of economic growth and to redistribute incomes in favour of the rich.||Sheila Bhalla

In his "The Economic Consequences of the Peace", Keynes warned that this drain would be unsustainable for Germany and counterproductive for the world. He was proven right by the resultant rise of Hitler. Yet many Third World countries are today being drained at 5 and 6 per cent of their GNP and 30 to 50 per cent and more of their export earnings annually through the resource transfer of their debt service. And despite this enormous hemorrhage of the Third World, most proposals to deal with the Third World debt crisis propose to further increase the debt now and debt service later even more.||Andre Gunder Frank

26/12/1987- ||special article||4377917||Structural Changes in the World Economy: Implications for Development Policy and International Co-operation||The world economy had by the beginning of the 1980s reached a state of near stagnation, with total output volume rising no more than 1.9 per cent in 1980 and 0.9 per cent in 1981, and total export volume actually declining by 1 per cent in 1981. Though there has been no general breakdown of the kind experienced between 1929 and 1931, sharp changes in prices and interest rates have brought several countries close to the point of default on their rapidly growing debts, massive short-term capital movements have further destabilised exchange rates, and the possibility of a major financial collapse with global repercussions cannot be ruled out. Clearly these are symptoms of a deeper malaise, not amenable to traditional policy prescriptions. This paper attempts to identify the important structural changes that have taken place in the world economy over the last quarter of a century, examine what brought them about and how they have affected its functioning and performance, and consider what the policy implications are for the resumption of growth and development on a reasonably stable basis.||K.

25/7/1987- ||special articles||4377284||Eighth Finance Commission's Award: Lessons We Can Now Draw||What it is that a Finance Commission ought to be principally aiming at? If the commission feels obliged to take as given the revenues and non-plan expenditures the centre and the states are 'committed' to raise or incur, it is only natural that a few states will have non-plan surpluses while a large majority will have deficits. Also, this approach perpetuates a system under which there is inducement to raise a minimum of revenues and enter into a maximum of non-plan expenditure commitments. This review of the experience gained from the working of earlier finance commissions in general and the eighth commission in particular leads to the conclusion that what is called for is an effort towards the effective realisation of the distribution of responsibilities between the centre and the states as originally envisaged in the constitution. Only if the allocation of funds out of the centre's revenues is made with that purpose, keeping in mind the differences in not only the states' capacities to raise revenues on their own but also in their levels of expenditure as objectively determined can the current unsatisfactory state of centre-state financial relations be reversed.||I.

29/8/1987- ||review of management, august 1987||4377440||Pressures of Modernisation on Human Resource Orientation||The process of modernisation of technology in Indian companies has generally been accompanied by an exuberance towards technological change and a willingness to experiment with newer approaches to the management of technological resources. These attitudinal shifts towards technology and technological change have not yet been directed, to any great measure, towards the human resources in our organisations. The result is that increasingly the people working with new technologies sense a contrast between the way they are being treated by their organisation and the manner in which the organisation treats technology. This perception of disparity is discernible in the signs of unease that are surfacing and manifesting themselves in the feelings of neglect and deprivation that workers often express. The real challenge of modernisation thus lies not in developing the ability to select, obtain and induct new skills and personnel but in reorienting the organisations' attitudes towards their human element.||Anil Chaturvedi,Abha Chaturvedi

The author discusses the implications for the developed and developing countries of the new wave of technological innovations which has emerged on the world scene as well as the insights of the new trade theories regarding optimal trade policies in the presence of oligopolistic market structures and increasing returns to scale. Against this background, the elements of a new international trading system, based on multilateralism, transparency and universality with the accelerated development of the developing countries as one of the primary objectives are outlined.||Vijay Laxman Kelkar

The study finds that women's labour accounts for 61 per cent of the total farm work, their participation being greater in activities like animal husbandry than in crop production, and that there is some tendency towards sexual division of labour.||J.

In fact, India's interest in international recognition of the Andaman-Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands as archipelagos was stated explicitly at Caracas. UNCLOS-III, however, stopped short of bestowing legal blessings on the claims of the archipelagian states. The stand of UNCLOS-III on the issue cannot be considered to be justifiable. The inhabitants of outlying archipelagos of continental states have the same dependence on the resources of the waters between and around their islands as is the case with mid-ocean archipelagos. Likewise, security and allied problems in such outlying archipelagos are no less real for the concerned continental states than they are for the archipelagic states. The archipelagian states should therefore work towards securing appreciation of the interests of the archipelagian states, especially when many of them, including India, are developing countries.||Shekhar Ghosh

31/1/1987- ||review of political economy, january 1987||4376619||An Early British Government Initiative in the Genesis of Indian Planning||While the idea of planning emerged as central to Indian nationalist economic thought only after the election of 1937, economic planning was a known concept to Indian thinkers in early twentieth century. Gokhale in 1903 and K T Shah and Visvesvaraya in the early twenties had stressed the importance of economic planning. In the early years of the thirties, people like Visvesvaraya, Mitter, Birla and Sarkar were enthused by the de facto recognition by the British rulers of the Indian demand for a positive role of the state in organising the socio-economic development of the country. This allowed them to formulate blueprints of plans and appeal to the colonial regime to implement them. This article discusses the early British efforts at planning in India with an attempt to explicate the logic of this effort and its failure. The mode and the economic objectives of planning attempted at by the British officials during 1930-34 did not differ qualitatively from what Indian planners were to advance later. This study, it is hoped, will enable us to understand better both the ideology of the colonial state during the last two decades of British rule in India and that of a bourgeoisie which grew up under colonial aegis and aspired to build up its own new state.||Raghabendra Chattopadhyay

The Finance Commission strives to ensure the financial autonomy of the states so that they may fulfil satisfactorily the functions assigned to them by the constitution. The Planning Commission brings the states into a national plan frame and leaves them hardly any sphere which they may call their own so that the country may move, without deviation or distortion, along the path of planned development of the Planning Commission's conception. This paper first outlines how successive Finance Commissions have striven to preserve and promote the federal character of the Indian union and then examines how successive Planning Commissions have imposed and promoted unitary elements in the system.||V.

For the two years during which she was in custody, she was brutally tortured. In 1977 she filed a petition in the court of the chief metropolitan magistrate, Calcutta, accusing four policemen of having violated relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. The petition which has been stayed several times on the pleas of the accused was resumed, ironically enough, on July 17 this year when seven organisations including the APDR and the Nari Nirjatan Pratirodh Manch demonstrated before the court and submitted a memorandum seeking a speedy disposal of the case. But on August 3 the accused sought to charge the organisation with contempt of court and obtained a stay order.||Nilanjan Dutta

1/5/1987- ||special articles||4377008||Recent Growth Experience of the Indian Economy: Some Comments||In an economy of the size and with the characteristics that India has, the stimulus for industrialisation has to come from agriculture rather than from the external sector. Industry has to grow by 'exporting' domestically to the agricultural sector, rather than abroad. For this an acceleration of agricultural growth is necessary which in turn requires a restructuring of agrarian relations, larger public outlays directed towards agriculture and with better regional spread, and 'fair' terms of trade and marketing arrangements. All this calls for more rather than less state intervention. Without endorsing the actual regime of bureaucratic controls that has existed for long in the economy, it needs to be emphasised that 'liberalisation' from that regime must itself be a planned one which must attempt to realise an alternative planned regime of controls. The course of development upon which the economy has embarked and which is characterised by a squeeze on agriculture, a fiscal crisis of the state, a downgrading of the role of the public sector, and moves towards blanket internal and external 'liberalisation' has to be reversed. To what extent this can be done depends upon the unfolding scenario with regard to the balance of class froces.||Prabhat Patnaik

14/2/1987- ||special articles||4376679||Urbanisation and Rural Change in West Bengal||The particular pattern of urbanisation in West Bengal-the overwhelming role of the primate city, the wide gap between the former and the other major cities in the region in terms of population size, economic activities and cultural influence, and the predominantly rural character of the other areas in the region-is distinct from the alternative pattern of decentralised urbanisation one sees in Punjab, Haryana, Kerala and some other states. The author argues that this contrasting pattern of urbanisation has a great deal to do with the differing land tenure systems, the colonial economic policies pursued by the British, and the course followed in terms of economic development in these two types of areas during the post-independence period. Section I of the paper deals with definitional and conceptual problems relating to various types of urban areas, and presents a historical account of the evolution of the present pattern of urbanisation. In Section II the present pattern of urbanisation is analysed and some case studies are introduced. Section III deals with the impact of urbanisation on rural areas, and in Section IV the impact of urbanisation on urban areas has been considered. Section V puts forward a particular strategy for urbanisation which emphasises decentralised urban growth with a rural focus. [The paper is being published in two parts. Sections I and II appear below. The remaining three sections will be published next week.]||Biplab Dasgupta

In part one, the characteristics of non-farm activity are analysed in terms of their material relations with agricultural production. A varied data set covering flows of commodities, money and finance and labour is marshalled to show that industry is not for the most part rurally located, small-scale, labour intensive and based on local raw materials and local final markets. In part two, the implementation of policies designed to favour rural non-farm activity is found to divert resources away from priority targeted sector. Our findings reveal the increasing importance of the national market and of regional integration and the likelihood of substantial flows of agricultural surpluses to the commercial, industrial and metropolitan economic sectors, a process supported by public sector mobilisation and allocation of resources.||Barbara Harriss

The Indian constitution has conferred complete independence and extensive powers on the auditor general to enable him to discharge his functions unhindered by anyone. The general impression in the country now, however, is that in spite of the immense powers of the auditor general, there is a serious breakdown of accountability and enormous waste, fraud and misuse. It is, therefore, necessary to examine to what extent government audit is carrying out its duties laid down in the constitution and how its performance compares with that of similar organisations in other parts of the world. Has it adapted its methods to suit the changing circumstances in the financial administration of the country? Is it a good watchdog of public funds?||K. P. Joseph

The negative aspects like high costs, technological obsolescence and inefficiency are traced to a wide array of controls on trade, capacity creation, production and prices. Votaries of the market mechanism basically argue that state controls on trade, capacity creation, etc, have forced sub-optimal decisions on the entrepreneur. There is, however, no a priori reason as to why controls should necessarily lead to inefficient operation or the adoption of obsolete techniques. Hence there is a need for an empirical study of the concrete experience in order to establish the relation, if any, between controls inefficiency. This paper examines the evidence available in the case of the capital goods and synthetic fibres industry for support of the above mentioned critique of import substitution based industrialisation. It also examines the view that the free play of the market mechanism can do away with the deficiencies of the earlier phase.||C. P. Chandrasekhar

The additional source of income through remittances does not substantially change the economic status of family nor helps it come out of its subsistence level. A little more food and a few basic needs to reduce their poverty is all they get in return for prolonged displacement of family life, emotional deprivation and insecure future, except for a possible bridge for their children to go to the big city. The women in these de facto female-headed households project themselves as the 'behind-the-scene' decision-makers, while trying to live according to the expectations of the patriarchal ideology, conferring the role of major decision-maker on the absentee husband. Thus male migration from the poor peasant or landless households by itself neither leeds to greater autonomy for women nor pulls the family out of its poverty.||Surinder Jetley
11/4/1987- ||special articles||4376901||Central Budget: Only the First Phase?||When all is said and done, the facts about the 1987-88 budget that stand out are the feeble efforts to increase revenues, the failure to control expenditures and the continuance of large inflation-potent deficits. Since there seems to be little prospect of successful control of expenditure, revenues have to be increased. And if revenues have to be increased, there have to be more taxes and increases in the administered prices in the coming months. The present budget then becomes only the first phase of budgeting for the year, subsequent phases coming later through supplementary tax bills and price-increases through executive orders. But such steps cannot go very far, unless the basic fiscal malaise of sharply rising non-plan non-developmental expenditure can be controlled, along with measures to increase the production and equitable supply of essential consumer goods. The budget alone cannot increase employment, incomes, demand and essential outputs, but every proposal included in it should be shaped by a full awareness of the development needs. It is sad to find that even now there is a complacent attitude towards prices, the balance of payments and income distribution. This complacence is bound to be shaken by the emerging pressures.||Bhabatosh Datta

Competition from Lancashire machine-made and cheaper piecegoods and high protective and discriminatory tariffs have been adduced as the reasons for the declining demand for Bengal's specialised crafts. The critics of the deindustrialisation thesis, however, refuse to accept this argument. They suggest that import of cheap yarn from Lancashire had improved the competitive position of the handloom weavers and further that effective demand for handloom products was actually on the increase since per capita consumption of cotton cloth had increased in the first half of the nineteenth century. Finally, it has been argued that Lancashire cloth could not be a substitute for the types of cloth demanded by the mass of the Indian people. This study of the cotton handloom industry in Bengal over a period of 50 years from 1870 to 1921 aims to throw light on some of these issues.||Ruma Chatterjee

30/5/1987- ||special articles||4377046||Agrarian Violence in Bihar||This paper argues that the present spate of agrarian violence in Bihar is a manifestation of intense struggle between the rural oligarchy and the direct producers, the latter comprising agricultural labourers and cultivators who use mainly family labour in their cultivation. Enmeshed in the feudal tradition of extra-economic coercion, the rural oligarchy is engaged in a feudal mode of appropriation of surplus and in intensification of exploitation. The direct producers have now decided to resist this exploitation and this antagonistic contradiction manifests itself in class struggle which surfaced in the late sixties and is now becoming bloodier every day. The struggle has intensified as the economic crisis has deepened because of non-development in an agrarian structure which remains dominated by semi-feudal relations of production even after more than three decades of independence. It may be possible to suppress the militant poor peasant movement by using the para-military forces in a big way, but not for long. If the economic roots of the peasant movement are not tackled by massive investment in water management and land reform measures providing land to the tillers to the exclusion of intermediaries, the movement is bound to surface again and again involving larger and larger geographical areas.||Pradhan H.

The results show the inegalitarian nature of price rise in a period of accelerating inflation that can have significant impact on inequality estimates. The study points to the need for publishing more disaggregated, expenditure-class specific cost of living indices and importance of continuing the search for a more plausible demand system for the Indian economy.||Ranjan Ray

By 1965, there were seven firms manufacturing commercial vehicles, four of which also produced passenger cars/jeeps. In 1981, the government approved the entry of four new firms (with Japanese collaboration) into the market for light commercial vehicles. This was followed by further liberalisation in industrial policies, viz, broad-banding, exemption from the provisions of section 21 and 22 of the MRTP Act, and the announcement of minimum economic scales. Since the very beginning, the government has placed more emphasis on commercial rather than private transport vehicles. This is evident in the successive Tariff Commission Reports as well as in the inclusion of commercial (but not private) vehicles in the list of 'Appendix I' industries in 1973. The industry has been protected via quantitative restrictions, a virtual ban on import of built-up vehicles, and high rates of duty. Given its role as a leading sector in economic development, the industry's average growth rate of 4 per cent over the period 1950-85 would seem to be inadequate. The recessionary period of 1965-77 was followed by a boom in 1978-81. Since then, production has stagnated and the euphoria generated by the easing of restraints has been replaced by pessimism resulting from over-crowding and over-capacity, an unanticipated slow-down in growth of demand, an unforeseen rise in the value of the yen, and ambiguity in government policy.||Sanjay Kathuria

An attempt is made to provide a method of estimation of incidence of revenue policies that affect consumer expenditure (commodity taxes, public sector commodity price-cost mark-ups and an expenditure tax) on people in various expenditure classes in the economy. Finally, some estimates are presented of distribution of burden of commodity and personal income taxes in India by household consumer expenditure classes.||M. N. Murty

The data, based on the minutes of the Joint Committee meetings, covering the period from the setting up of the forum in 1973 through to mid-1982. The paper traces how in a multiple union situation, the forum sought to evolve commonly acceptable norms for determining union representation to the forum, and then went on to reconstitute itself through secret ballot. Through the process of joint decision-making, the apex body was able to make both management and unions accountable to the forum, and acquire directive authority as well as participate in rule-making for the organisation. On the basis of this experience, the paper concludes by questioning the validity of certain commonly held assumptions about workers' participation in management, in the Indian context.||Cherian Joseph

The government's approach to rural housing has been based on four considerations: (1) highly subsidised housing should be provided for the poor; (2) the poor should use their own labour to construct their houses; (3) low-cost houses should use local materials and local skills; and (4) the public, the co-operative and the household sectors should be involved in housing activity.

The core of the IRDP is to provide poor families with income-generating assets to enable them to cross the poverty line. What share of IRDP assistance goes to the deserving poor? What kind of assets are they provided with? What is the order of leakages that take place? What are the problems associated with bank financing of IRDP? Are IRDP loans bad debts? Do the assets remain with the beneficiaries? Are they better off due to IRDP assistance? What proportion of them cross the poverty line? These are some of the questions that the author attempts to answer. The analysis of the various issues is based on the massive primary data/information generated by the concurrent evaluation survey of IRDP carried out by reputed research institutions in the country on behalf of the Department of Rural Development of the government of India during October 1985-September 1986. Neither the scepticism of the antagonists of IRDP nor the excessive optimism of the protagonists of the programme is warranted. The findings clearly show that the IRDP is a mixed bag.||N. J. Kurian

Such a policy leads to a substantial increase in the redistributive capabilities of indirect taxation. The paper uses a three-step procedure in calculating the tax rates: the aggregate revenue requirement is initially allocated across individuals so as to equalise after-tax expenditures; the 'efficiency' criterion of Ramsey is, then, used to calculate 'optimal' commodity tax rates for each individual; finally, a "loss function" minimisation procedure is used to aggregate them into the two sets of tax rates. A comparison with tax rates calculated using traditional social welfare maximisation confirms that the poor gain quite considerably under the proposed dual tax rate policy.||Ranjan Ray

This has led to an expansion of infrastructure as well as staff in many states, with a number of categories of non-health staff being drawn into the programme to help fulfill targets. This paper presents a brief review of the health and family welfare programme in Gujarat and points out that the programme is not only expensive but also generally ineffective. Moreover the single-minded approach to family planning has meant a neglect of primary health care, with programmes such as those combating malaria and tuberculosis, crucial to achieving improvements in health status, have been grossly neglected.||Sudarshan Iyengar,Ashok Bhargava

The 'swing' between these two can only be marginal at any rate. However, the social and economic factors that give rise to such swings and their differential consequences on different interest groups in society need careful analysis. While the state in a capitalist society will cater principally to the interests of the capitalists to accumulate, it is merely on instrument of their class domination. It has a relative autonomy arising from the phenomenon of 'class-in-struggle' as well as from the fact that it reflects not only the economic interests, but also the interests of the realm that is beyond or between the state and the economy. Hence non-capitalist, non-accumulating interest groups in society, especially in a society with a democratic polity, have the possibility of influencing state policies although this is conditioned by the strength of the coalitions they can bring about to achieve the objectives they are committed to. Social sciences have tended to treat the shifting interrelationships of class interests, the state and the market in the isolation which has made for analytical rigidities. Economic processes and social processes in general can be understood only to the extent to which these shifting interrelationships are captured to any given time and over time.||C. T. Kurien

The problem of curriculum is related to our perception of what kind of society and people we are, and to our vision of the kind of society we want to be. By taking shelter in the 'received' perspective and the 'principles of curriculum development' that it offers, we merely shun our responsibility and allow ourselves to be governed by choices made long ago or elsewhere under very different circumstances. Whatever we can determine to be worthy of being taught is the proper candidate for inclusion in the curriculum. The obvious issue here is how to determine 'worth'. What kind of value can we put upon different types of knowledge to distinguish between worthy and unworthy kinds from the standpoint of their candidacy for becoming material for educational transaction? We can distinguish between two routes to solving the problem. The first consists of deciding the worth of what we want to teach in view of the learner. The second consists of determining worth in terms of the intrinsic value of what we want to teach. The author chalks out both these routes and then discusses how satisfactory or otherwise they might prove in solving the problem of curriculum.||Krishna Kumar

What concept of aggregate production would be the appropriate one is a question which has often been raised by investigators in the field of Indian national income. Some of the early estimates of Indian national income, by excluding a number of services, provide a measure of aggregate production which is not very different from what one would obtain by using the concept of NMP. In fact, such a restricted use of national income is favoured in certain circles even today. Against this background, and in the light of his own discussion of the relative significance of the two concepts, the author has attempted to check against the Indian experience whether the trend of aggregate production would be markedly different under the two systems.||Madhusudan Datta

In fact the patriarchal bias of the social and the legal system gives rise to the assumption that once the men of the family have land, the women's needs are automatically taken care of. This study attempts to place the issue of the denial of land rights to Ho tribal women in the context of women's daily lives, work, struggle for survival and status in the family and community.

An endlessly repeated theme has been that it was the magic of the unhindered free-market mechanism, with its concomitant of unrestrained export-orientation, which did the trick for all these countries. This paper argues that effective development in these countries has relied on both market-forces and public policies and government intervention. It has rested on import substitution and export promotion; and credit and interest-rate subsidies, preferential tax treatment, differential exchange rates, preferential treatment of capital goods imports and other deviations from the free-market signals have been essential elements of the successful development policy of these countries.||Anindya Datta

It is almost as if the Indian power system belonged to another world. Whilst it also shared in the inflation that ensued, it was virtually untouched by the rise in oil prices because its dependence on oil was negligible. It faced chronic excess demand, which it could not satisfy despite an extraordinarily high rate of growth of output. It could forget about efficiency and profit, and concentrate on breathless growth. This paper outlines some of the forces that shaped that growth, and attempts to assess the efficiency of the system. The picture has been put together piecemeal, for data on the Indian power system are sparse and inaccessible. Basic official statistics are published annually, but with a lag of three to four years; other information has to be looked for in widely scattered sources. The paper begins with the analysis, in sections I-III, of the three factors that have shaped the system, namely demand, resources and organisation. It then goes on in section IV to describe the supply of funds and the power it gives to the central government. In section V we present some indicators of system efficiency. Finally in section VI we try to answer why the system works in terms of broadly satisfying demand and why it fails in terms of efficiency.||Ashok V. Desai

The study shows that the socio-economic status does not influence rent to the disadvantage of the less privileged tenants in particular. It is further evident that the variations in rent are unrelated even to the relative social or economic status of the lessee-lessor. The relative status, however, seems to influence contractual obligations other than kind rent, such as sharing of by-product and labour rent. It is concluded that the big landlord can no longer increase his exploitative hold in the land rental market (especially in one of the two villages) and therefore the weak tenant is exploited in other inter-linked markets.||C.

25/7/1987- ||review of political economy, july 1987||4377278||Commercialisation and Economic Analysis||Commercialisation of agriculture is an inevitable and essential feature of the emergence and consolidation of capitalism. Yet, such process is imbricated with dualities and regional variations especially in the colonial countries. Indeed, it is not possible to homogenise the historical impact of commercialisation. Taking as its point of entry, a recent volume of essays on commercialisation of Indian agriculture, this article analyses the complexities of interpreting the processes of commercialisation in colonial structures. This analysis emphasises that commercialisation alters the modalities of allocation and accruals in a society. But its terms are not clarified for the toiling people. The author urges the abandonment of any 'stage paradigm' or any idea of a linear progression where a 'retarded colonial capitalism' establishes its dominance after political independence. The review extends to broader questions relating to the use of categories in social science research.||Asok Sen

This paper traces the consequences of state intervention in the traditional resourse use pattern of a paddy growing micro-region in south India during 1850 to 1940. The geographical confines of the study is Nanchilnadu which comprised of the two taluks of Agastiswaram and Tovalai in the present Kanyakumari district. State intervention in Nanchilnadu, the author argues, destroyed the pre-existing physical balance between crop land and non-crop land in the region as a basis for the reproduction of paddy technology. Consequently, Nanchilnadu peasants were increasingly forced into the market as buyers of various agricultural inputs. This involvement of the peasants in the market, inter alia, took its toll during the 1930s when the decline in paddy price was accompanied by inputs exhibiting downward price rigidity in the region. A large number of peasants in Nanchilnadu became excessively indebted and a number of them were forced to sell away their lands. Hypothetically, had the traditional resource use pattern of the region continued, the harshness of the economic crisis of the 1930s on the peasantry of Nanchilnadu might have been less.||M. S. S.

By the time the need for a policy to regulate the environmental damage caused by industry was accepted, there already existed a complex system of industrial legislation. The environmental policy in India has evolved out of a series of exercises by policy-makers to strike an appropriate balance between the two goals, of rapid economic development on the one hand and pollution control on the other. This paper reviews the industrial pollution policy in India focusing on the procedures through which the policy is being implemented and the attendant problems.||Susan G. Hadden

The issue chosen for examination is that of widow marriage and the period is confined to the last three decades of the nineteenth century. Progressively convulsing the upper caste, mainly middle class, Hindu society, the issue was one that epitomised the interplay of conflicting emotions, values and ideas that characterised men's consciousness about women during this seminal phase of Indian history.||Sudhir Chandra

To recognise this is one thing, but to follow it up in the allocation formula with the help of a well-defined methodology is another. The Gadgil formula followed by the Planning Commission in allocating the central share of state plan outlay since the Fourth Plan gives a 10 per cent weightage to the tax efforts of states. For this purpose, realisation of the target of additional tax revenue is considered as a measure of tax effort. This measure of tax effort, though convenient, is unscientific and may even turn out to be iniquitous. The Eighth Finance Commission has not remedied the situation. Though it studied the "relative taxable capacity and tax efforts of Indian states", its methodology and findings are not known and they have apparently failed to carry conviction even with some of its own members. Against this background, this paper seeks to measure the relative tax efforts of 16 major states during the period 1970-82.||M. A. Oommen

The relevant question to ask is whether if capitalism transforms itself and survives in a new form in which the means of production are owned by the workers, will it be better or worse for labour than if capitalism continues in its present antagonistic form. A process should be immediately initiated by which the entire capital of a firm will come to be owned by its employees, not necessarily in one stroke but over a period of, say, 10-20 years. Undoubtedly, this constitutes a major political-economic reforms and it will be necessary to work out its details carefully. They are indicated here only in broad outline. To focus attention on the essentials, government and other non-profit-making institutions are left out and only companies in the private and public sectors are considered.||V. M. Dandekar

To develop it widely would require massive investments in spite of it being a labour-intensive industry. Due to the nature of the product, investment in this field is very risky. Further, the low labour costs in India are unlikely to provide any cost advantages to Indian software on account of the small size of the home market and the large marketing costs in the international market. As such, government protection is crucial for the survival of this industry in India. The new software policy, by opening the Indian market to international competition at a time when the industry is still in its infancy, would effectively mean the end of this industry in India, the author argues. When the basic skills themselves would not exist, talk of higher-end software and value-added products would be quite meaningless. The industry would also lose the few remaining skilled people in the field.||Arun Kumar

The authors' analysis shows that the contribution of administered price increases to past inflation has been considerably greater than what was suggested in the discussion paper on administered prices prepared by the Finance Ministry. Is a high rate of inflation, then, a price which the government must pay for following the Seventh Plan's financing strategy? Not necessarily, for there are, the authors find, a number of major administered prices which could be raised substantially without triggering much extra inflation. The prices of a range of public sector products, such as coal and lignite, fertilisers, non-ferrous metals and rail transport services, fall in this category. A policy of judiciously selected administered price increases would, therefore, go a long way in closing the Seventh Plan resource gap without generating very high rates of inflation.||Shikha Jha,Sudipto Mundle

It is interesting to recall that many of these issues had already surfaced in the early years of the Indian tea industry although at that time the policy prescriptions focused on co-operative industry behaviour rather than on desired changes in government regulations, for those were years of minimal government intervention in industry.

His revivalist ideas and his protests against the arrogant cultural invasion of the colonial masters as projected in his writings etched out the ideals for the newly educated young man and for his wife. Govardhanram's central theme was the conflicts faced by a young male graduate. The ideal wife whether she belonged to a wealthy influential family or hailed from a traditional background and was uneducated, was one who would manage the house skilfully, and even in adversity remain witty and cheerful. It is in order to fulfil this role that a girl was to be educated.

It is based on a sample of nearly two thousand migrant households from Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, now living in a resettlement colony in Delhi. The data are used to examine many questions: Does ethnicity matter? How does the length of stay in Delhi affect a migrant household's propensity to return to its origin and its propensity to remit money? How does caste affect behaviour? Is there a connection between remittance and a household's income? The extent to which these variables are compatible with the economist's scheme of analysing migration and remittance is then explored.||Alaka Malwade Basu,Kaushik Basu,Ranjan Ray

The effect of HYV technology (HYV seeds, chemical fertiliser, irrigation) and mechanisation (tractors, combine harvesters, etc) on employment is reviewed separately for crop production over the year and for individual crops. An attempt is made to identify the impact of technology on employment of labour according to size of holding, composition of labour (family/hired, male/female) and seasonality. Labour absorption in allied agricultural and non-agricultural activities is also explored.

On what basis do we decide that a certain mortality difference must be socially rather than purely biologically derived? The answer is usually to compare the observed mortality difference to the expected difference based on western experience, but this glosses over the need to examine South Asian environments and epidemiology for their own expected effects on sex differentials. In addition, what are the expected biological sex-differential outcomes of levels of mortality that are, by international standards, extremely high? Are age-specific patterns of mortality for both sexes different from those based on western models, and why? Is the relationship between these sex-specific patterns different than it is in western experience? In trying to answer some of these questions, the author advances two presuppositions: (1) that excess female mortality, in its socially conditioned aspect, forms a part of an overall reproductive strategy, which in most cases reflects strategic calculations of social units considerably larger than the household; (2) that class and gender relations may have primacy over many other independent variables as determinants of demographic rates. In other words, variables which operate at a more proximate level may be decisively influenced by changes in class and gender relations, and in their interrelations.||Alice W. Clark

However, as the purchasing power of the Indian farmer is limited, except for a small section in the green revolution areas, the major buyer the business houses have sought is the government which has tried to modernise agriculture by providing a variety of subsidies. These subsidies have progressively increased and are heaviest in areas designated as 'tribal', 'backward' or 'drought prone'. With the introduction of a tax rebate for rural development work, the number of business houses entering the rural areas increased very sharply. This paper argues that the business houses' activities in the countryside are for creation of markets for new agro-products and not for rural development. Their secondary interest is in increasing the surplus product and appropriating a share of the larger surplus arising out of modernisation of agriculture and related activities. This argument is supported by a case study.||Manorama Savur
19/9/1987- ||special articles||4377511||Keynesian Economics and Under-Developed Countries Again||It is resources constraint rather than demand deficiency to which one would have to turn for an explanation of mass unemployment and under-employment in an under-developed country. In India we have had the telling experience of rising prices and money wages invariably associated with deficit-induced investment. There may have been misallocation of resources, leading to over-capitalisation and periodic depression in one or the other sector of the economy. But of a general deficiency in aggregate demand there is hardly any evidence. It is often argued in support of the demand deficiency hypothesis that many of our industries have been running at less than full capacity. This indeed is so; we have in our economy the spectacle of unemployment and excess capacity. Yet one would hesitate to call it a Keynesian phenomenon. For while there is excess capacity in many of our industries, it is also often the case that just such industries enjoy a seller's market. Excess capacity in our industrial sector has to be explained not in terms of demand deficiency, but in terms of market imperfection-monopolistic competition or simply oligopoly, often reinforced by shortage of raw materials. The remedy here lies not in the creation of additional demand through deficit financing but through a release of competitive forces in the economy. As a step towards this a suitable dose of import liberalisation need not be ruled out.||A. K. Dasgupta

They are (1) over-manning of the existing capital stock leading to an increase in the capital-labour ratio; and (2) the presence of old capital stock, i e, prolonging the life of capital to the extent of outliving its economic utility. It is because of the latter that the impression that our machine tools are obsolete has received credence though this hypothesis has not been empirically tested. In the light of data provided by the machine tool surveys this paper attempts to determine the age of machine tools in India. Though productivity of this industry is stagnant or falling, Indian machine tools are of relatively newer vintage. This phenomenon of young machine stock and low productivity can be explained in terms of the strategy of diversification, import of technology and organisation of production.||P. Mohanan Pillai,J.

Tax concessions have been reviewed from time to time and modified or replaced with new incentives. The main argument is that tax incentives lower the cost of capital and this provides an incentive to entrepreneurs to step up the rate of investment. In this note, the various tax incentives provided in India to lower the cost of capital have been examined using a 'rental cost' of capital model. The basic model is first outlined and then extended to account for the effect of the various tax concessions available to firms.||Rita Sharma

The latter has a tendency to be low when tariff is high and conversely tend to be high when tariff is low. One important implication of this is that substantial tariff reductions in the presence of imperfections in the world market are suspect; the foreign producer would rob some, if not all, of the benefits of such tariff reductions. Instead, a rise in tariff might be rightly placed; it would exert pressure upon the foreign producer to absorb the tariff hike.||R. G. Nambiar,Rajesh Mehta

This paper presents a model which displays the Ricardian stress on profit rate, the neoclassical factor substitution, the Keynesian effective demand, and the post-Keynesian concern for capacity utilisation. It is shown here that under certain conditions an under-employment equilibrium can be replaced by a full-employment-full-capacity equilibrium through raising the wage rate, rather than through wage cut. International aspects of the problem are briefly commented upon.||Ranjit Sau

In 19th century Bengal, the educated Bengali gentry's campaign-both administrative and ideological-against the cultural expressions of the indigenous lower orders was determined to a large extent by the concept of 'obscenity' which they imbibed from their English colonial mentors, who in their turn shaped the concept in accordance with the rigid and unaccommodating morality of the Victorian society of England. The concept still continues to rule the attitude and behaviour of the Bengali 'bhadralok' (the 'respectable' gentry) towards the expressions of the 'chhotolok' (the unlettered lower orders). The latter's raw, uninhibited articulation of perceptions of the surrounding stark reality, is quite often countered by self-protective euphemisms which are typical expressions of the perennial social and political ambivalence of the 'bhadralok'. This article seeks to trace the roots of this attitude to the cultural values that were being formulated by the English-educated Bengali 'bhadralok' in the 19th century, a large part of which was concerned with the need of obscuring certain aspects of the reality, particularly those relating to the common man's sensual delights ranging from food to sex.||Sumanta Banerjee

The situation is likely to get much worse in the late 1980s, with a further squeez on bilateral as also multilateral, concessional aid flows. The option that remains is to manage the balance of trade, or ensure that exports increase faster than imports. The paper attempts to evaluate India's export performance in the recent past examining the underlying factors and assessing the relative importance of domestic and foreign constraints. It finds that the impressive growth in exports between 1970 and 1978 was attributable to an unusual combination of external and internal factors. While internal factors such as, the decrease in the rate of growth of agricultural production leading to a decline in the volume of exports of primary commodities on the one hand, and on the other, the increasing internal demand for manufactured goods industrial which made the export of goods less worthwhile for individual firms, contributed to the slowing down of export growth, external factors which came into operation in the 1980s helped to sustain the adverse trend. The author suggests that with the steady increase in protectionism in the industrialised countries and with the near-stagnation in international trade flows leading to fierce price and non-price competition, the pressure of external factors on manufactured exports from India will accentuate.||Deepak Nayyar
1/5/1987- ||special article||4377019||Middle Class Politics: Case of Anti-Reservation Agitations in Gujarat||The middle class has grown in size disproportionately with economic growth in Gujarat. While their aspirations have risen, they are unable to satisfy their needs and maintain the traditional status, and therefore experience a strong sense of deprivation. This is especially true of the upper and middle caste members who are jealous of the new entrants from the traditionally low castes. The two anti-reservation agitations in Gujarat were essentially struggles within the middle class-between the upper and middle caste members on the one hand and the new low caste entrants on the other. In these agitations they have had the backing of the capitalist class with which they have strong ideological and social links. They control the media and the educational institutions and dominate the bureaucracy and the police. Reservations were first introduced by the political elite only as a means of catching votes and of diffusing the aspirations of the deprived classes. But lacking any perspective of social transformation, the concept of reservation has been reduced to a mere political gimmick.||Ghanshyam Shah

Each revision has extended the exclusive monopoly powers of the patent holders and weakened the bargaining powers of developing countries which have to purchase technology from TNCs who own the majority of the patents. Most national legislations have incorporated the major provisions in the Paris Convention regardless of whether the countries are members of the Paris Union or not. A critical examination of the existing national and international patent systems reveals that these have had an adverse effect on the economic, commercial and technological development of the pharmaceutical sector in the Asian and other developing countries. The economic and social policy on patent legislation should be to secure the maximum possible benefits in relation to social costs entailed. A rational patent policy should be one of the components of an integrated national pharmaceutical policy. A number of developing countries have in recent years introduced significant changes in their national legislation on patents. These reforms were so designed as to make the patent system strike a balance between the need for economic development and social change on the one hand, and the rights granted by the patents on the other.||Kumariah Balasubramaniam

The author's analysis of a sample of 28 paper mills also leads to the conclusion that small mills have higher costs of production relative to the large mills because they cannot avail of the pronounced economies of scale that characterise the paper industry. The current installed capacity of the paper and paper board industry is sufficient to meet present and near-term future demand and the industry should, therefore, concentrate on utilising existing capacity rather than on fresh capacity creation. Government should aid the modernisation of large mills and small mills should concentrate on the varieties of paper that are reserved for them. The author also suggests changes in the structure of excise duties so as to maximise capacity utilisation in the industry.||Alka Subramanian

Credit is made available in anticipation that activities so set in motion will be validated by acceptance in the market and realisation of price which has to include the element of interest on funds employed. Against this background, the tendency to raise rates of interest runs counter to the objective of maintaining or lowering the level of prices. Unless conscious steps are taken to reverse this tendency, this factor of rise in interest rates will perpetuate inflationary forces. Expenditure on interest has already weakened the financial structure of government. It will do likewise in respect of economic agents other than the government. The role of monetary and credit policies will therefore remain important in the task of maintaining price stability.||M. P. Chitale
07/2/1987- ||special articles||4376650||Indian Judicial Renascence: The Lines Not Crossed||Two judgments delivered by Chief Justice Bhagwati on his last day in office are of more than ordinary significance. The judgments in the Bihar Ordinances Case and the Shriram Case indicate certain limits that the Supreme Court has set for itself in what may broadly be described as public interest litigation, or social action litigation, which has developed fast and deep in the last nine years. The scope and reach of public interest litigation varies according to which authority or person is involved as delinquent or defaulter. In the Bihar Ordinances Case, the authority primarily concerned was the state of Bihar. The repromulgation of ordinances, without bringing them before the legislature, was doubtless reprehensible, but the constitutional issue was the extent to which the Supreme Court could scrutinise and, if necessary, assail the subjective satisfaction of the governor that the ordinances in question were necessary. As it turns out, the court has not sought to decide this point at all, but has skilfully skirted it. Constraints of a different kind emerge when the court must directly enforce the public interest against a private 'person' or corporate body. The Shriram Case falls partly in this category. The point decided by the constitution bench in December concerned the applications made for compensation to those affected by the escape of gas. Here the court chose not to express any final view on whether the Shriram unit could be compelled to give compensation to the claimants by an order of the Supreme Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction. During his judicial tenure Justice Bhagwati contributed much to the retrieval of the Article 32 jurisdiction at least as against government-controlled corporate bodies, which was an advance on the more restrictive view taken by the court in earlier years. However, when the opportunity presented itself to extend the ambit of Article 32 to cover privately-owned 'public limited' companies, the constitution bench of the Supreme Court chose to draw a line.||Anil Nauriya

11/7/1987- ||special articles||4377218||Economic Liberalisation in India: Balance of Payments Implications||In recent years, a gradual shift from import-substituting industrialisation under QR towards a more liberalised economic regime is beginning to take place in India. In this paper, we accept economic liberalisation (as being proposed in various official pronouncements of the government of India) as a policy objective and try to work out the contours of a policy package to accompany the liberalisation attempt so that it can be sustained in the long run. It is argued that the sustenance of liberalisation will rest crucially on whether our export earnings will increase sufficiently in the not-too-distant future. In this paper, the experience of other countries (particularly S Korea) along the path of economic liberalisation is reviewed. The empirical as well as theoretical analysis in this paper suggests that investment in export industries must be made more profitable relative to investment in import-substituting industries in order to encourage resource movements from import-substituting industries to export industries which is so essential for the long-term increase in export earnings and consequently for the sustenance of economic liberalisation over the long haul. With that end in view, the paper emphasises the crucial role of the exchange rate mechanism. In the specific Indian context, the paper brings together evidence to suggest that the economic regime in India is in fact biased against exports and urges for the use of the nominal exchange rate as a policy instrument to achieve and maintain an appropriate level of the purchasing-power-parity-adjusted effective exchange rate.||Alok Ray

The region and variety-specific incentive structure of cotton is estimated by adopting a standard methodology. Four major varieties of cotton dominant in the regions of Maharashtra, Gujarat, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh are covered. Broadly the results do not support a policy of protection for cotton cultivators in India.||Ashok Gulati

Correct understanding of the role of money in economic activity hinges on defining and measuring money correctly. There has been a growing tendency both in India and abroad to conduct monetary analysis and policy in terms of empirically defined broad money and multiple measures of money. Recently, the Committee to Review the Working of the Monetary System also has held that M3is the appropriate definition of money and that the money multiplier framework is dependable for money supply analysis and control. This would give a further wrong direction to the evolution of monetary theory and monetary policy as well as their information base in India. This paper seeks to undertake a fresh and comprehensive discussion of major issues relating the concept, measure, and determination of money supply with a view to restraining the tendency mentioned above. Section I examines which of the existing approaches to defining money is correct. Section II discusses the special economic characteristics of money, while section III presents a new measure of money supply for India in the light of these characteristics. Section IV examines whether and how far the money multiplier theory is empirically supported in India. [This paper is being published in two parts. Sections I and II appear below while the last two sections will be published next week.]||L. M. Bhole

Direct, regulatory measures on the lines of the model bill suggested by the centre, namely, 'The Groundwater (Control and Regulation) Bill' of 1974, have yet to be enacted by the state legislatures. And the indirect measures, such as restricting institutional finance and electricity connections in the endangered areas, have proved rather ineffective. The author thinks that in the particular conditions of relatively small and fragmented landholdings in India legislative enactments are of little practical value and, therefore, main reliance has to continue on indirect measures. And here we need to broaden the set of measures.||B. D. Dhawan

What distinguished the BDP from a 'Master Plan' was its approach to planning for urban development as a positive, integrated package designed to strengthen not only the civic infrastructure but also the economic base of the city rather than viewing the task as a 'single shot exercise' confined to working out the contours of future land use with only a regulatory role for the local government. With the ending of the 20-year period which formed the perspective of the BDP, it is time to ask whether the elaborate and painstaking exercise of the BDP has made any real difference to the quality of civic life in the Calcutta Metropolitan District. Have the aims of the BDP been realised? If not, what went wrong? The answers to these questions would provide important lessons for metropolitan and urban planning for the future, and not for Calcutta alone.||Amaresh Bagchi

It is argued that the management science orientation and the practical concerns of the discipline have taken it away from its broader social science moorings. A meaningful discipline of public administration in India has to reckon with the undifferentiated nature of administration and politics and the deep involvement of the administration in the social structure and processes. The theories of the state, especially the theoretical developments in the conceptualisation of the 'third world' state, need to be related to the structure and operation of public organisations. Public administration as a subject of study has thus to be located within a broader field of political theory. A discipline that avoids analysing the role of administration in sustaining a structure of domination, repression and injustice, is not a genuine social science but a courtier subject.||Mohit Bhattacharya

Yet the consumption levels of a crucial nutrient like oils and fats in the country are not only below the world average but also far below the minimum nutritional requirements prescribed by the ICMR. The domestic demand for vegetable oils and fats has been rising at a very fast pace whereas domestic output has lagged far behind the growth in demand, forcing the government to resort to large-scale imports of edible oils to bridge this shortfall. Making the country self-sufficient in its edible oil requirements has therefore been accorded priority in our development plans. This paper analyses the growth behaviour and factors influencing supply response of edible oilseeds in India, particularly groundnut and rapeseed-mustard which account for bulk of our edible oilseeds output. Apart from a disaggregated analysis of time series data covering the pre- and post-green revolution phase of Indian agriculture, the study also analyses the role of technology, price, weather uncertainty and farmers' expectations about prices and yields on their area allocation decisions in respect of oilseeds.||K.

It offers several advantages to entrepreneurs, scientists and technologists and to consumers. The provisions of the Act help India ensure that blocking and repetitive patents are not allowed to stifle technological and industrial self-reliance. According to the Paris Convention the protection of the industrial property and rights of patentees has supremacy over the interests of any country or its people. More than 99 per cent of the 3.5 million patents held by individuals or corporations are in developed countries and the Convention largely helps them maintain their monopoly in member countries. If India joins the Convention now, it will be bound to give wider rights to the nationals of all member countries without matching reciprocity. The disadvantages for India far outweigh notional advantages for any activity, be it in the area of innovation, technological development or industrial self-reliance.||N. N. Mehrotra

In fact the patriarchal bias of the social and the legal system gives rise to the assumption that once the men of the family have land, the women's needs are automatically taken care of. This study attempts to place the issue of the denial of land rights to Ho tribal women in the context of women's daily lives, work, struggle for survival and status in the family and community. This is the second part of the paper which is being published in three parts.||Madhu Kishwar

Since the introduction of a liberalisation regime in 1977, initially high growth rates prompted discussion of the nation as an 'IMF success' or vindication of the 'Singapore model' of an open economy divorced from extensive state intervention both internally and at the internal-external boundary. This article argues that the pre-1977 configuration defined a dependent welfare state which made significant progress in mediating between aggregate national poverty and individual well-being; that stagnation has been over-emphasised in critiques of the dependent welfare state; and that poor economic performance has been more a function of the dependency situation than of spending priorities internally. Ironically, the liberalisation regime has increased dependency along some dimensions; its domestic economic performance is analytically inseparable from the extraordinary financial flows extended by important international powers. The evolution of the dependent welfare state under a philosophically laissez-faire regime reflects in form the interaction of external carrots, sticks and exogenous shocks with domestic political limits to further reduction of the social wage and internal pressures of patronage and ordinary politics. The analysis treats primarily the period prior to disruptions of the economy caused by escalation of civil disorders.||Ronald J. Herring
