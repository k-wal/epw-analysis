At the same time prices of white printing paper have been raised to levels which have put exercise books and textbooks beyond the reach of the majority of primary school children.||Arun Ghosh

A number of provisions in the resolution are, however, contrary to the interests of tribal communities. Conservation and development of forests will benefit tribal communities only when the existing regulatory and prohibitive nature of forest legislation is changed.||Sharad Kulkarni

Even if the food stocks with the government can avert famine deaths, the biggest problems are likely to be, first, drinking water and, second, fodder for the cattle. And there is no doubt that there is little connection between the drought relief works programmes and long-term plans consistent with the needs of the area.||Arun Ghosh

A Comparative Analysis of Sugar Co-operatives in India||The co-operative sugar factories of western India (in Maharashtra state) are remarkably successful examples of local development initiative. This paper presents a comparative sociological analysis of these co-operatives in order to pinpoint the organisational factors which are crucial for their success. Comparative analysis of privately-owned sugar factories in India reveals a basic weakness in the cane supply relationship between the private factories and the surgarcane growers-a weakness which the co-operative factories have overcome. As a result, the co-operatives can operate at higher technical and economic efficiency than the private factories. Moreover, although the co-operatives receive some helpful subsidies from the government, much larger subsidies are directed to the private factories at the expense of the more efficient co-operatives. The success of the co-operative sugar factories depends not only on a superior cane supply system (which resolves a problem specific to the sugar industry), but also on their ability to generate a stable alliance among the small, medium and large cane growers who are the shareholders. This alliance is made possible by two sets of factors: internal factors, which are specific to the technical requirements of sugar production; and external factors, which are rooted in the agrarian system of the region where these co-operatives have flourished. Comparisons with other types of co-operatives in other regions of India show that the presence or absence of similar factors determines whether a given type of co-operative will succeed or fail. Detailed comparisons with the successful dairy co-operatives of Gujarat show that co-operative alliances between small and large farmers may take different organisational forms under different regional conditions. Political organisation is also influenced by the nature and scale of the production process. The general conclusion is that the probable success or failure of co-operative organisations can be predicted through such comparative analyses-analyses which compare co-ops with other types of private and co-operative enterprises, taking into account (a) the technical and organisational requirements of the production process, (b) the distribution of interests and possibilities for a stable alliance among the members, and (c) the regional agrarian systems which determine the natural and social environments of the co-operatives.||D.

The view that emerges is that these programmes suffer primarily from a lack of conceptional clarity and an inadequate understanding of the complex nature of the environment in which they have to be implemented. It is thus the programme design which needs to be reviewed, taking into account the implications of the 'environmental' factors and carefully assessing the 'capacity' of the administrative machinery that is available. Greater clarity about the objectives and goals of each programme, the norms and other criteria for project selection, as well as role specificity of the different levels in the organisational structures involved in executing the programmes-all aspects of more systematic programme planning and design-would go a long way in giving the anti-poverty programmes at least a chance of success.||Sandeep Bagchee

The communists have been at the forefront of the tribals' struggles against illegal exactions by forest and police officials, for better prices for minor forest produce and for higher wages for work in the Forest Development Corporation's plantations and timber depots. The Andhra Pradesh government has responded with a police campaign to systematically burn down and destroy entire tribal hamlets.||K. Balagopal

In the following three decades, the situation worsened. Between 1921 and 1931 working class housing increased by less than five per cent aggravating the situation. The chawls, some owned by the government, others by the mills and nearly half of them belonging to private landlords, were mostly rickety structures which often collapsed, injuring and killing the residents. Quarrels at the water tap leading to violence and murders was a feature of urban working class lives, as were such practices of landlords as rack renting, pagdi, the use of musclemen, etc. In 1935 the Congress Socialist Party helped to form the first working class tenants' union which took up various issues such as rent assessment standards, rent waivers during periods of high unemployment and even demanded free housing for the working class. Though the union functioned until 1945, it was not successful in mobilising large numbers.||Radha Kumar

In Karnataka, vast natural forests have almost disappeared to provide fuel and raw material for a number of old and new industries. The Karnataka government has undertaken a systematic programme of reforestation with single-stand eucalyptus plantations in these areas which have been cleared of natural forests. This article examines the social forestry programme of the Karnataka government which was introduced at about the same time as the land reforms were being implemented and draws attention to the fact that the programme has resulted in small and marginal farmers abandoning foodgrain cultivation not out of choice but out of the inability to grow these crops in lands surrounded by eucalyptus plantations.||D.

With the above issues in mind, the author studies the nature of interactions and processes that exist amongst four government departments at the district level. The departments selected are irrigation, public works, police, and administration, the last comprising the revenue, magistracy and community development functions under the district magistrate. The districts themselves are from Uttar Pradesh. Two of the districts regularly experience natural calamities in the form of floods or droughts, whereas the other two have fewer such experiences. The logic of so selecting the districts is to examine whether, under pressures created by the environment, the departments experienced any significant shifts in the patterns of their interaction.||Anil Chaturvedi

In fact, India's interest in international recognition of the Andaman-Nicobar and Lakshadweep islands as archipelagos was stated explicitly at Caracas. UNCLOS-III, however, stopped short of bestowing legal blessings on the claims of the archipelagian states. The stand of UNCLOS-III on the issue cannot be considered to be justifiable. The inhabitants of outlying archipelagos of continental states have the same dependence on the resources of the waters between and around their islands as is the case with mid-ocean archipelagos. Likewise, security and allied problems in such outlying archipelagos are no less real for the concerned continental states than they are for the archipelagic states. The archipelagian states should therefore work towards securing appreciation of the interests of the archipelagian states, especially when many of them, including India, are developing countries.||Shekhar Ghosh

Solutions can be sought only on the basis of a comprehensive understanding of the ecological factors at the root of the problem. Drought has generally been associated exclusively with deviations in rainfall. In actual fact the current water scarcity is a result of our failure to ensure the stability of the water cycle in the course of implementing developmental programmes.||Jayanta Bandyopadhyay

The additional source of income through remittances does not substantially change the economic status of family nor helps it come out of its subsistence level. A little more food and a few basic needs to reduce their poverty is all they get in return for prolonged displacement of family life, emotional deprivation and insecure future, except for a possible bridge for their children to go to the big city. The women in these de facto female-headed households project themselves as the 'behind-the-scene' decision-makers, while trying to live according to the expectations of the patriarchal ideology, conferring the role of major decision-maker on the absentee husband. Thus male migration from the poor peasant or landless households by itself neither leeds to greater autonomy for women nor pulls the family out of its poverty.||Surinder Jetley

The legacy of the colonial diara revenue policy in the form of continuing oppression and agrarian strife has made this title all the more apt, not only in an environmental context but in economic, agrarian and social terms as well. This paper addresses itself to the complicated interaction between ecology and agrarian rights in the Dharampur pargana of Purnia district and the primary importance of the unique Kosi diara environment in promoting and instigating the oppressive batai system within this pargana.||Christopher U.

30/5/1987- ||special articles||4377046||Agrarian Violence in Bihar||This paper argues that the present spate of agrarian violence in Bihar is a manifestation of intense struggle between the rural oligarchy and the direct producers, the latter comprising agricultural labourers and cultivators who use mainly family labour in their cultivation. Enmeshed in the feudal tradition of extra-economic coercion, the rural oligarchy is engaged in a feudal mode of appropriation of surplus and in intensification of exploitation. The direct producers have now decided to resist this exploitation and this antagonistic contradiction manifests itself in class struggle which surfaced in the late sixties and is now becoming bloodier every day. The struggle has intensified as the economic crisis has deepened because of non-development in an agrarian structure which remains dominated by semi-feudal relations of production even after more than three decades of independence. It may be possible to suppress the militant poor peasant movement by using the para-military forces in a big way, but not for long. If the economic roots of the peasant movement are not tackled by massive investment in water management and land reform measures providing land to the tillers to the exclusion of intermediaries, the movement is bound to surface again and again involving larger and larger geographical areas.||Pradhan H.

In the first section the data base and methodology of the study is spelt out. The second section describes the setting of the village in its ecological, social and economic dimensions in the traditional context from the viewpoint of fodder as a resource and proceeds to throw light on the traditional man-livestock relations on the villages of the district. The third section, depicting the changing scenario, is divided into three parts-dealing with agriculture, the changing ecological regimes and the changing man-livestock relations in the village. The fourth section examines the imperatives of a greater access to nature thrown up by the changes explained and analysed in the previous sections and the ability/inability of various classes of livestock owners to realise this imperative. The concluding section briefly sums up the findings of the study and its relevance to the possible solutions to the problem.||A. Damodaran

By the time the need for a policy to regulate the environmental damage caused by industry was accepted, there already existed a complex system of industrial legislation. The environmental policy in India has evolved out of a series of exercises by policy-makers to strike an appropriate balance between the two goals, of rapid economic development on the one hand and pollution control on the other. This paper reviews the industrial pollution policy in India focusing on the procedures through which the policy is being implemented and the attendant problems.||Susan G. Hadden

Direct, regulatory measures on the lines of the model bill suggested by the centre, namely, 'The Groundwater (Control and Regulation) Bill' of 1974, have yet to be enacted by the state legislatures. And the indirect measures, such as restricting institutional finance and electricity connections in the endangered areas, have proved rather ineffective. The author thinks that in the particular conditions of relatively small and fragmented landholdings in India legislative enactments are of little practical value and, therefore, main reliance has to continue on indirect measures. And here we need to broaden the set of measures.||B. D. Dhawan
