At the same time prices of white printing paper have been raised to levels which have put exercise books and textbooks beyond the reach of the majority of primary school children.||Arun Ghosh

A Comparative Analysis of Sugar Co-operatives in India||The co-operative sugar factories of western India (in Maharashtra state) are remarkably successful examples of local development initiative. This paper presents a comparative sociological analysis of these co-operatives in order to pinpoint the organisational factors which are crucial for their success. Comparative analysis of privately-owned sugar factories in India reveals a basic weakness in the cane supply relationship between the private factories and the surgarcane growers-a weakness which the co-operative factories have overcome. As a result, the co-operatives can operate at higher technical and economic efficiency than the private factories. Moreover, although the co-operatives receive some helpful subsidies from the government, much larger subsidies are directed to the private factories at the expense of the more efficient co-operatives. The success of the co-operative sugar factories depends not only on a superior cane supply system (which resolves a problem specific to the sugar industry), but also on their ability to generate a stable alliance among the small, medium and large cane growers who are the shareholders. This alliance is made possible by two sets of factors: internal factors, which are specific to the technical requirements of sugar production; and external factors, which are rooted in the agrarian system of the region where these co-operatives have flourished. Comparisons with other types of co-operatives in other regions of India show that the presence or absence of similar factors determines whether a given type of co-operative will succeed or fail. Detailed comparisons with the successful dairy co-operatives of Gujarat show that co-operative alliances between small and large farmers may take different organisational forms under different regional conditions. Political organisation is also influenced by the nature and scale of the production process. The general conclusion is that the probable success or failure of co-operative organisations can be predicted through such comparative analyses-analyses which compare co-ops with other types of private and co-operative enterprises, taking into account (a) the technical and organisational requirements of the production process, (b) the distribution of interests and possibilities for a stable alliance among the members, and (c) the regional agrarian systems which determine the natural and social environments of the co-operatives.||D.

The view that emerges is that these programmes suffer primarily from a lack of conceptional clarity and an inadequate understanding of the complex nature of the environment in which they have to be implemented. It is thus the programme design which needs to be reviewed, taking into account the implications of the 'environmental' factors and carefully assessing the 'capacity' of the administrative machinery that is available. Greater clarity about the objectives and goals of each programme, the norms and other criteria for project selection, as well as role specificity of the different levels in the organisational structures involved in executing the programmes-all aspects of more systematic programme planning and design-would go a long way in giving the anti-poverty programmes at least a chance of success.||Sandeep Bagchee

With the above issues in mind, the author studies the nature of interactions and processes that exist amongst four government departments at the district level. The departments selected are irrigation, public works, police, and administration, the last comprising the revenue, magistracy and community development functions under the district magistrate. The districts themselves are from Uttar Pradesh. Two of the districts regularly experience natural calamities in the form of floods or droughts, whereas the other two have fewer such experiences. The logic of so selecting the districts is to examine whether, under pressures created by the environment, the departments experienced any significant shifts in the patterns of their interaction.||Anil Chaturvedi

Solutions can be sought only on the basis of a comprehensive understanding of the ecological factors at the root of the problem. Drought has generally been associated exclusively with deviations in rainfall. In actual fact the current water scarcity is a result of our failure to ensure the stability of the water cycle in the course of implementing developmental programmes.||Jayanta Bandyopadhyay

The legacy of the colonial diara revenue policy in the form of continuing oppression and agrarian strife has made this title all the more apt, not only in an environmental context but in economic, agrarian and social terms as well. This paper addresses itself to the complicated interaction between ecology and agrarian rights in the Dharampur pargana of Purnia district and the primary importance of the unique Kosi diara environment in promoting and instigating the oppressive batai system within this pargana.||Christopher U.

In the first section the data base and methodology of the study is spelt out. The second section describes the setting of the village in its ecological, social and economic dimensions in the traditional context from the viewpoint of fodder as a resource and proceeds to throw light on the traditional man-livestock relations on the villages of the district. The third section, depicting the changing scenario, is divided into three parts-dealing with agriculture, the changing ecological regimes and the changing man-livestock relations in the village. The fourth section examines the imperatives of a greater access to nature thrown up by the changes explained and analysed in the previous sections and the ability/inability of various classes of livestock owners to realise this imperative. The concluding section briefly sums up the findings of the study and its relevance to the possible solutions to the problem.||A. Damodaran

By the time the need for a policy to regulate the environmental damage caused by industry was accepted, there already existed a complex system of industrial legislation. The environmental policy in India has evolved out of a series of exercises by policy-makers to strike an appropriate balance between the two goals, of rapid economic development on the one hand and pollution control on the other. This paper reviews the industrial pollution policy in India focusing on the procedures through which the policy is being implemented and the attendant problems.||Susan G. Hadden
