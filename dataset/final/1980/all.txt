This article explains why this is so and in that process attempts an assessment of the Urs years in Karnataka. Specifically, it discusses the various reformist measures initiated and, in varying degrees, implemented by the Urs administration and argues that the broad alliance of deprived groups that Urs built, partly out of conviction, but partly also as a device to break the political power exercised by the traditionally dominant groups in Karnataka, is likely to continue. It is a measure of Urs's achievement that his successors, even while deriding him, cannot offord to change his policies significantly.||James Manor

This may herald a transformation of silk marketing and so it may be a fitting moment to offer, perhaps as a requiem for the old order, an account of the working of an interesting section of the old silk market. Such an account would provide a basis for evaluating the reforms as well as making some contribution to the as yet limited sociological literature on the operation of 'merchants' in contemporary India.||S.

09/8/1980- ||special articles||4368952||Assam: A Colonial Hinterland||This article argues that there has been a systematic exploitation of the rich resources of Assam, before 1947 by the colonial rulers, and since then by the Indian State and Indian capitalists who have continued the colonial tradition. It details some of the features of this exploitation in the extractive industries of oil, tea, jute and forest products. A common charge levelled against the current movement in Assam on the foreigners' issue is that it is diverting the attention of the masses from the basic problem of economic underdevelopment. The author argues that, on the contrary, the movement has highlighted these fundamental causes of economic underdevelopment. Indeed, a positive outcome of the current agitation, according to the author, is the growing awareness of the colonial pattern of the exploitation of Assam's natural resources among the masses of the Assamese people. Only a realisation of the colonial pattern of exploitation of Assam's resources can help one to understand the more fundamental causes behind the wide and sustained participation of both rural and urban masses in the current movement in the state.||Tilottoma Misra

It helps explain the various demands of the sugar industry aimed at promoting its profits at the expense of the consumer, the exchequer and the farmer.

28/6/1980- ||special articles||4368804||Class Struggle and Foreign Trade in China||The main criticisms on the question of foreign technology and finance which is involved in China's drive for the four modernisations are that imports of technology and the resulting indebtedness will make China increasingly dependent economically and politically, and potentially subservient to imperialism and multinational corporations. Further, it is felt that the economistic nature of the present policies together with foreign capitalist involvement will lead to strengthening of the position of revisionists and even comprador capitalists within China, leading to the restoration of capitalism. These criticisms then are levelled not so much at the practice of modernisation and economic growth as such. They are concerned about the way in which modernisation is being conducted, and the disturbing lack of concern over the impact or inequalities between and among workers, peasants, intellectuals, scientists, managers, etc.||Terry Cannon

This paper attempts a quantitative analysis of the economic conditions of beedi workers in Kerala. It considers various aspects like load of work, wage and non-wage benefits, savings and indebtedness and the occupational hazards of beedi workers. The paper also touches upon the impact of existing labour legislation covering this category of workers, and the tendency of the industry in Kerala to move into states where legislation governing beedi labour is considered favourable.||M.

The Indian informal financial market, once far larger than the formal one, has both declined and changed its form in response to the expanding roles of the banks in recent years. But it remains an important force in the economy. Two Banking Commissions in 1929-30 and 1972 surveyed important sectors of this market, but changed circumstances since 1969 (when the banks were nationalised) and some limits on the 1972 Banking Commission Reports' coverage have rendered a limited resurvey necessary for a full consideration of this informal market.||Thomas Timberg,Chandrasekar V.

27/9/1980- ||special articles||4369126||Politico-Economic Developments in Maharashtra: A Review of the Post-Independence Period||The two main political developments of the early post-1947 period in Maharashtra were the establishment of Maharashtra state and the displacement of the old urban-dominated political leadership in the region by a new leadership from the advanced rural elements in which the Marathas (or the Maratha-Kunbis) are the dominant caste cluster. Both these developments reflected the wider spread of political consciousness and democratisation of politics which had been taking place, before and after the acceptance of adult franchise and a republican constitution in 1950. The economic development of Maharashtra, with the great concentration of industry and business and the service sector in Bombay and its suburbs, shows that, in spite of their protestations to the contrary, the political leadership hailing from the affluent sections in the rural areas has made its peace with the Indian big business, at the expense of the common people in the city of Bombay and in the countryside. This paper analyses political and economic developments in Maharashtra since independence. Sections I and II, published this week, deal with developments of the early post-independence period upto the formation of the separate state of Maharashtra in 1960 and sections III and IV, which will appear next week, with developments in the post-1960 period.||A.

It describes the immediate as well as long-term problems and demands that first led to the series of work-to-rule and go-slow agitations in early 1979, as well as the suspensions and lock-outs declared by the company, and the almost inexorable building-up towards the actual strike which began on October 5. It examines the stands of the Mico Employees Association as well as that of the MICO management and that of the state government, and the impact of the strike on the company, the workers and the many big and small units in the automobile industry and their ancillaries. An attempt is also made to understand the problems faced by traditional working class organisations when they have to lead struggles in plants as MICO where the technology is highly advanced, and the demands and problems of the workers, most of whom are highly skilled and are relatively well-paid, are quite different from the kind of demands traditionally voiced by the organised working class in India.||Dilip Subramanian

It discusses the political leanings of various unions and notes how important political shifts were invariably reflected in corresponding shifts and mergers in the unions as well. The major part of the paper is devoted to an analysis of the structure of the unions in Southern Railway, the differences between various types or categories of unions, and the factors that have contributed to the multiplicity of what have come to be known as 'categorical' unions in the Indian Railways.||D.

Total decontrol with unregulated releases has proved disastrous for the industry. The other conclusion that emerges is that the co-operative form of organisation has done little to protect the interests of the consumer. It is generally argued that co-operatives have solved the problem of cane supply traditionally faced by joint-stock mills in up. But the experience of the co-operatives in at least one region suggests that in fact they may not have solved the problem at all. This calls for a serious review of the working of sugar co-operatives in India. What specific class interests do they serve?||Sanjaya Baru

In particular, many confused notions regarding Lenin's and Kautsky's studies on the development of capitalism were rectified. And yet, some problems remain which peclude many from fully accepting the thesis that it is the capitalist laws of motion that govern Indian agriculture. The primary issue being the presence of extensive share-cropping (Chandra 1974: 1324) in India. This issue, we feel, if located directly in Marx, Lenin and Kautsky's works on the development of capitalism lends itself to resolution and can help one overcome the hesitancy in acknowledging that the laws of motion in Indian agriculture are governed primarily by the capitalist mode of production. It is to such a task that this paper is addressed, with the added proviso that there is no intention here of providing a conspectus of the entire debate on the subject of the development of capitalism.||Dipanker Gupta

When British colonialism assumed political power over western India in 1818, it inherited two principal problems in Thane district. On the one hand, a multiple, often confusing, revenue system; and, on the other, a large tribal population which fell outside the pale of any regular revenue system, practised slash and burn cultivation and sometimes indulged in what the British called 'gang wars'. Over a short span of three decades the British introduced in this region the raiyatwari land settlement and settled the tribals to a semblance of regular cultivation. With the establishment of a colonial state apparatus that sanctified and reproduced the raiyatwari settlement with its inalienable and transferable rights in land, forces were set in motion that were to subsume the Thane tribals into both a rent paying formation as tenants and a feudally subjugated forced labour on the rice-growing coastal lands and fruit gardens. The peculiarity of this transformation lay in the supra historical 'leap' for the tribals from participation in a natural economy to forced subsumption into modes of surplus appropriation as both tenants and forced labour. It is this 'leap' that constitutes the elements of the process of tribal 'peasantisation' in Thane district.||Ashok K. Upadhyaya

This paper reports the findings of a field investigation covering 143 households in two districts in Kerala, Trichur and Malappuram, borrowing under the scheme. This investigation of these selected beneficiary households shows that while the DIR cannot be faulted on turning out to be a 'relief' programme, misallocation and misutilisation of loans has not been avoided, and the loans have not been avoided, and the loans have not always gone to the poor and the needy.||M.

It is, however, hard to accept that the introduction of the proposed substitution account will make any significant contribution towards making the international exchange market less unstable, towards enhancing the position of SDR in the world monetary system or towards promoting world monetary reform generally on the right lines. The substitution account idea was, and is, basically an idea that sought to solve the problem between the old and new reserve currency countries, namely the problem of the overhang of the old reserve currency resulting largely from exchange market interventions by the new reserve currency countries. The developing countries have unfortunately so far thought in terms of holding their reserves in the form of one or the other financial asset. Never has any serious thought been given to investing their reserves in commodity stocks. The financial resources which these countries can raise from among themselves given their own currency reserves are never thought of as a means of financing commodity reserves in the context of commodity price stabilisation. Will they see the connection now?||I. S. Gulati

Most of the model builders in the UK found the original versions of their models inadequate in many ways and have modified them from time to time. While the Keyensian expenditure model in real terms still remains at the centre of their work, the need for a monetary model either as a part of the main model or as an independent complement and a consistency check has been growingly felt and is being met to varying degrees. The supply side of the models is admittedly weak and is being progressively strengthened. While appreciating the need for short-term forecasting, it is being increasingly appreciated that only medium-term forecasting can be meaningful if all the implications of policy changes are to be fully reflected in the economic assessment.||M.

Widely hailed as a model, the reforms have in fact been relatively well implemented and effect a substantial redistribution of privilege, but stop considerably short of establishing 'land to the tiller', as is often claimed. The privilege of obtaining income (and security) from land ownership independent of labouring on the land has been transferred, and on a significant scale, but not abolished; the rents of rentiers have been abolished, but not the profits of capitalist landowners, who may or may not be functionally absentee. The major beneficiaries of the abolition of landlordism have been rich peasants, not poor peasants or agricultural labourers. The major reasons for this result lie in the conceptualisation, rather than lapses in implementation, of the reform measures, most importantly the uniform treatment of all tenant-landlord relations as 'feudal' rather than a recognition of tenancy as a privileged property form on most of the leased area in the state and the treatment of the problems of agricultural labourers as those of a rural proletariat rather than as those of an aspiring peasantry-to-be.||Ronald J.

Control on working capital at the national level is exercised primarily through credit controls. The Tandon Study Group has provided a comprehensive operational framework for doing this. At the corporate level, investment in working capital is as important as investment in fixed assets. In operational terms, efficient working capital management consists of determining the optimum level of working capital, financing it imaginatively and exercising control over it.||Natarajan Sundar

This note attempts to examine whether there is any validity in this contention and whether there is really any point in changing the base for computing tax holiday profits from capital to income.||Amaresh Bagchi

Endowed with religious, social, and economic importance, marriage reflects the ideals and environment of a society. The retention or modification of marriage customs in India is therefore a reflection of change in society. The significance of marriage as an index of the impact of the various forces which act upon a society has been too little recognised. This study which is based on field work and research in Nagercoil, Tamil Nadu, attempts to relate the institution of marriage to the changing norms and realities of a society.||Ruth Suseela Meinzen

But plans for irrigation investment in South and Southeast Asia are being made with too little attention to diagnosing the causes of the generally disappointing performance of large, publicly-operated canal systems. One set of causes, which the authors argue here are very important, are simply not considered; they are 'screened out' from consideration from the very beginning. The remedies are hence unlikely to have the effects expected of them.||Robert Wade,Robert Chambers

Section II deals with the broad trends in the growth and pattern of expenditure of the Government of India during the last three decades or so. Whereas Section III spells out the approach to, and identification of, areas or activities where economies and rationalisation of expenditure can be suggested, the conclusions are indicated in Section IV.||Jag M.

19/1/1980- ||special articles||4368330||Energy Crisis and Its Impact on Energy Consumers in Third World: I||Though they woke up to the problem only in October 1973, the energy crisis had long been a writing on the wall for the industrial world and, even more, for the countries of the Third World. For a country like India, the immediate impact was traumatic for all sectors of energy consumers. Two options are now open: (i) to keep augmenting supplies of fossil-fuel energy to match ever-increasing consumption (the hard path); and (ii) to conserve such non-renewable fossil-fuel sources of supply and tap increasingly the renewable sources (the soft path). The soft path is the more workable option for the industrial world as also for the Third World; though there will be immense difficulties in its acceptance and inevitable time-lags in its implementation. The industrial nations, the author argues, need to come forth to help the Third World adopt the soft path. They have the wherewithal to conduct research into the abundant base of renewable energy sources of the Third World countries, to develop appropriate equipment and appliances and to make them available on soft terms. Consumers and their organisations, particularly in the Third World, need to adopt concrete programmes aimed at creating awareness of the dimensions and implications of the energy crisis.

1/10/1980- ||small industry overview||4369157||Some Aspects of Rural Industrialisation||The rationale for the emphasis on rural industrialisation in the development policy in India lies primarily in the following objective conditions. First, agricultural growth, even if rapid to the extent feasible, is unlikely to be able to provide productive employment to all the labour force in the rural areas. Second, underemployment among even those engaged in agriculture would continue following from the very nature of agricultural activities. Third, the organised industrial sector, mainly concentrated in urban areas, has not been growing fast enough to absorb the growing labour force in the cities, let alone the rural workers migrating to seek work in the urban industrial sector. As a result, a large part of the rural labour force is either unemployed for most of the year, or earns very low incomes though engaged in some work or the other for most of the year. Diversification of the rural economy, therefore, seems essential for the increase in employment and incomes - particularly of the relatively disadvantaged groups of small holders and landless labourers. Development of industrial activity in the rural areas seems the only obvious method of achieving such diversification.||T. S. Papola,V. N. Misra

It briefly touches upon the situation as prevailed before the nationalisation of life insurance business and then traces the changes in mortality rates in more recent times. Its findings are that there is a distinct improvement in the rates of mortality of assured lives during the last forty years which, in certain age groups, even compares favourably with the rates of improvement of mortality of assured lives in a far more advanced country like Britain. But the rates of mortality as prevailed in India were such as there was possibly little scope but for improvement. The paper also attempts comparisons with the American and Japanese experiences.||J.

12/4/1980- ||special articles||4368563||Employment Guarantee Scheme and Food for Work Programme||The Employment Guarantee Scheme (EGS) generated an employment for 3.9 lakh person years in rural Maharashtra. Thus it provided employment to 10 per cent of the 41 lakhs of workers among the weaker sections of Maharashtra. The 32nd round of National Sample Survey (NSS) too indicates that EGS offered an employment of more than 3 lakhs person years. Thus the two independent estimates more or less agree. On an average, the EGS worker worked for 160 days a year for about Rs 3 a day. Wheat distribution on EGS, through the Food For Work (FFW) programme raised the wages to Rs 4 a day. In spite of EGS, however, 90 per cent of the households of EGS workers lived below the poverty line. To raise them above the poverty line, EGS workers would have to be provided work for 300 days, rather than the present 160 days or so, on a wage rate of Rs 4 a day. A husband and wife totally depending on such wages could earn Rs 2,400 a year maintaining only 1.3 dependents above the poverty line, since Rs 720 a year per capita were needed for the very minimum food needs. A wage rate of Rs 6 for 300 days alone could help the couple to bear the present load of family of five, above poverty line. The Food for Work programme in 1978-79 helped to get an increase of 33 per cent and more in the EGS earnings of the workers and was considered the greatest attraction of EGS.||Kumudini Dandekar,Manju Sathe

This has not been simply a wrongheaded or futile attempt to overcome the colonial heritage. By placing the cart before the horse, these policies have in fact often helped to perpetuate the technological dependence of the economy on advanced capitalist countries. This is not to say that there is any satisfactory theory of invention at an early stage of capitalism. But we do know something about how inventions feed one another and what allows inventions in laboratories and pilot plants to grow into commercial innovations. And we also know something of the history of the incorporation of the process of innovations in state-supported institutions and in giant international firms in later phases of capitalism. Compared with that, our knowledge of what induces technological change in an underdeveloped capitalist country such as India is extremely scanty. This paper seeks to raise some doubts in areas where dogmatic uncertainty has dictated the expenditure of thousands of crores of rupees.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

This paper reviews the literature and presents some data on the recent experience. There is so much written on this subject, however, that this survey cannot hope to be exhaustive. It concentrates on certain themes that are likely to be of direct interest to policy-makers and students, mainly with reference to works, published and unpublished, that have appeared in the past five years or so. Section I deals with the recent trends in manufactured exports by region, Section II with the products exported and studies of the comparative advantage underlying the observed patterns, Section III with market penetration into the developed countries, and Section IV with the main agents responsible for export growth, with special reference to the role of multinational companies. Section V draws the main conclusions. This paper is published in two parts. Sections I and II appeared last week.||Sanjaya Lall

Until recently, differences in intellectual orientation, methodological dogma and philosophical outlook, as well as of institutional affiliation, has tended to keep their practitioners apart and at odds. Over the past few years, the situation has begun to change due to a convergence in theoretical perspectives between economists and anthropologist interested in empirical studies of decision-making and a convergence of their interests, for example in the rural poor. It appears, however, that successful collaboration depends on researchers sharing an interest in the same empirical problems, and probably some explicit co-ordination. For a full specification of village level social change we need census, survey, and participant-observer 'anthropologic' observation at different points in time tied into a broader historical framework - both as regards the village and national community and region.||Allan Hoben,Thomas A.

After a general review of the functioning of the DICs, the article goes on to identify the various operational problems faced by them, including those related to the organisational structure of the DICs, their working methods, rules and procedures, and their financial powers - or the lack of them. While on the whole the DICs present a somewhat depressing picture, there is no reason why, if some of these defects and constraints are removed, they cannot function towards the realisation of their laudable objectives.||M.

In passing, and by way of contrast, it also considers the corresponding developments in the growth of production relations in Kerala between the ninth and the middle of the eighteenth centuries. The object of the paper is to illuminate a particular course of historical development, and to make certain points of wider theoretical interest. It argues that there was an Asiatic mode of production in the Hindu kingdoms of most of southern India prior to foreign conquest and that the Asiatic mode in Thanjavur, while conforming to Marx's model in fundamental respects, permitted greater social change and development of productive forces than Marx's model allows for. Marx's formulations of 'modes of productions', while brilliantly illuminating historical development of western Europe and the dynamics of capitalism, do not and were not intended to suffice for the theoretical discussion of the history of Asia or the world at large. What is attempted in this paper is not a theoretical framework for such a vast exercise; instead, the paper tries to place Marx's formulation of modes of production in a broader setting of cultural evolutionary theory, and use them to understand changing production relations in Southern India.||Kathleen Gough

In his article last week, after reviewing Emmanuel's thesis on unequal exchange in international trade, the author reformulated its main propositions by recasting them in the Sraffa system. In this article he applies these propositions to a domestic economy and elaborates on the form exploitation and class conflict assume under conditions of unequal wages between different sectors and industries. He concludes by bringing out the implications of this for the prospects of a peasant-worker alliance in the Indian economy.||V. M. Dandekar

The paper is in three parts. Part I outlines some basic features of the economy of Poovar where the field-investigations were conducted. Part II delineates the features of the local credit market and shows how it is as under-developed as the rest of the economy. One of the main theses of this paper is that the Poovar economy is both labour and credit rationed and that the disequilibrium on the labour market has a direct bearing on the credit practices and the behaviour of some lenders. To that extent, it should be viewed as another confirmation of the hypothesis that in traditional rural areas, labour and credit relations are usually interlinked. Part III offers some tentative explanations as to why it is so.||J. Ph. Platteau,J. Murickan,A. Palatty,E. Delbar

First, we want to examine the rationality of the government's steel price policy with reference to the profitability of the Indian public sector steel industry. Secondly, we would like to show how the past performance of a plant can be analysed to separate the effects of prices from the effects of inefficiency on the financial results, at the micro-plant level of the public sector steel economy. Although our objective is to evolve methods of judging the rationality of the steel price structure and the performance of the integrated steel plants, we have illustrated their application with reference to the three mild steel plants of the erstwhile Hindustan Steel (HSL) at Bhilai, Rourkela, and Durgapur, for 1973-74 and 1976-77. The results of the application have been used as the basis of our conclusions regarding government's pricing policy during 1973 to 1978. Since HSL constituted a large fraction of the public sector steel industry for most of the period under consideration, the results of our study would largely reflect the situation in the public sector during the period.||Ramprasad Sengupta

Attempts have been made to estimate the number of production units of various kinds now operating in India. These are sometimes absurdly contradictory. Again, while information is to be had on oilseeds production, percentage crushed, oil contents and oil recoveries in ghanis and expellers, no estimate appears to have been made of the proportions of vegetable oil derived from these various production technologies. An attempt has been made in this paper, on the basis of available data, to derive information regarding the types of oil-production units and the quantity of oil deriving from each. A final total oil production estimate has been made which includes all major production technologies. In a sequal to this paper, to be published next week, the author will examine the nature and extent of movement of oilseeds and oils, starting with the regional production pattern for each oilseed, and the production pattern for the oil present therein.||S.

26/4/1980- ||special article||4368605||Finance for Industry||Financial institutions are apparently anxious about the increasing reliance of private sector industry on borrowings from institutions rather than on equity or risk capital and borrowing from the market. This excessive reliance on borrowed funds is said to result from the concessional rate of interest charged on loans by financial institutions. That the interest payments are allowed under the Income-Tax Act to be deducted in computing taxable profit while payment of dividend on risk capital is not so deductable no doubt influences industry. There is a suggestion, therefore, that, in the interest of raising greater amount of funds in the form of equity, interest payments on borrowed funds should not be allowed as a deduction in computing taxable income. Such disallowance is not intended to increase the tax burden. Hence the tax rate applicable to company profits should be reduced and the lower rate should be charged on an expanded taxable base (inclusive of interest payments). It is argued that, if there is no particular tax advantage in financing business from borrowed funds than from risk capital, supplies of good equities in the market would increase rapidly. The auther of this article argues, however, that disallowance of interest on borrowings will not encourage investment of household savings in the risk capital of companies. To promote public participation in any long-term investment in industry it is essential to develop an effective market. Under the existing pattern of interest rates on bank deposits this can be done only on the basis of an attractive current yield. The absence of this necessary condition accounts for the discouraging response of investors to investment in marketable industrial securities. This situation cannot be improved by 'disallowance' of interest on borrowings. Section I of this article analyses the behaviour of investors and examines the possible consequences if the suggestion were implemented. Section II describes the capital market can be made vigorous by discouraging companies from retaining profits and increasing the flow of household savings into industrial securities through prospects of attractive current yield. Section III deals with the role of banks and financial institutions in the development of the capital market and the provision of finance for industry. Section IV considers how present benefits, derived from ploughback of company profits, can be availed of under the suggested modifications in tax structure. Section V summarises the main recommendations.||M. P. Chitale

The giant 'food' industrial complexes in the United States have thus, over time, absorbed enterprises engaged in farming, agrochemicals, farm machinery, food processing, wholesaling and retailing, transport and real estate and even multinational banking. This paper reviews some of the ramifications of the US food industry by examining three of its major segments, farm output, food processing, and distribution, and shows how the increasing prices the consumer has been paying for food of an increasingly inferior quality, and the decreasing incomes that the farmer has been getting for the product of his labour (when he himself has not been squeezed out of his vocation) are an inescapable aspect of the growth of oligopolistic capitalism in the US food industry.||Frederick F.

This article attempts to expose some of these official distortions to which both imperial considerations of the British Indian government and the 'nationalistic' aspirations of the government of free India appear to have contributed. It calls for a close scrutiny of the role of the Historical Division of the External Affairs Ministry in the perpetuation and strengthening of the myths that surround the border dispute between India and China.||Karunakar Gupta

It is useful to take the Plan document as a departure point for discussion, because it sets out the proposed approach of the government for 'reduction', if not 'eradication', of rural poverty. In the course of three decades of planning in India, each set of government interventions in regard to rural poverty have amounted to 'case-policies' in the same way as decisions of administrative and judicial tribunals generate case law over a period of time. In terms of this legal analogy, the Sixth Plan document can be viewed more as an instance of 'codification', upon which discussion and debate could be usefully undertaken.||S. Guhan

In India, rotational delivery has been the normal rule in the canals of the north, while in the south continuous flow delivery has been the rule. What is surprising is not that continuous flow has been the normal rule in south India, but that even when water becomes scarcer than normal because of a drought during the growing season, little attempt is made to shift to a rotational delivery rule. The result is that those in headreach positions get preferential access to whatever supplies are available and the shortage is passed down towards the tailend areas, where water arrives in amounts too small to be used. This paper describes a case in south India where water-saving changes in rules of delivery and management effort and planning were made in response to a severe drought mid-way through the growing season. For the first time in the canal's 100-year history, a rotational delivery schedule for the whole canal was formulated and (more or less) implemented. The author describes in some detail how the canal managers responded to the drought as it developed. Detailed accounts of canal operation in practice, such as that attempted here, can help estimate just how serious the canal mismanagement problem is, and how much potential there is for improving canal performance through better operating procedures, without expensive rehabilitation of physical structures. If such potential is large, as this case study suggests, then the rate of improvement in the effectiveness of canal systems can be considerably higher than the present engineering-oriented remedies would lead one to suppose.||Robert Wade

Some scholars hold the view that farm prices have been systematically and, perhaps, deliberately kept down while others believe that various incentives have pushed agricultural prices disproportionately upward. This paper argues that the whole debate, as till now conducted, has been marred by considerable confusion arising out of the inappropriate data and the wrong methodology used in the analysis of the data. Part I of the paper examines these methodological problems and Part II presents details of an alternative methodology. Its conclusion is that, contrary to the widely held view, terms of trade have in fact moved against agriculture in recent years.||A. S. Kahlon,D. S. Tyagi

At present, however, a substantial portion is used as fuel, fencing and thatching; only a small percentage is being used in the manufacture of jute boards. To commercialise the use of jute sticks, therefore, the possibility of providing an alternative fuel to the cultivators could be investigated. The scope of this paper has been restricted to discussing the feasibility of utilising jute sticks in the paper industry. In this context, the quality, availability and economics of paper manufacture from jute sticks vis-a-vis conventional raw materials has been studied. Further, on the basis of experience gathered from manufacture of paper from jute sticks on a commercial scale at the Indian Paper Pulp plant some suggestions have been put forward to make the jute sticks system economically viable.||Mahasweta Das

Yet, the Supreme Court's judgment fails to take into account its own findings in the case of Sanjay Gandhi whom it had found guilty of abusing his bail and tampering with evidence and attempting to suborn prosecution witnesses when the case was still before the trial court. Moreover, its appreciation of the evidence for the prosecution adduced at the trial court, and of the change in the nature of the brief of the new prosecuting counsel following the change of government at the Centre in January 1980, is unreal. The judgment leaves many questions unanswered. It is a pity that a case of such importance involving high public figures and raising issues of consequence concerning respect for the Supreme Court and freedom of expression should have been disposed of in a judgment so inadequate and unconvincing, and which was delivered in the most unusual circumstances, without the prosecution's case being urged at all.||A.

This article, based on a study of urban associations, caste and non-caste, in Bangalore, argues that caste associations are by definition flexible in their aims, since unlike other associations they do not, deliberately, have any functional specificity. The article touches upon the factors that have contributed in the past to the formation of caste associations or renewed activity on the part of existing, but moribund, associations. The present stimulus to the revival of activity by caste associations in Bangalore city is seen to be related to the fact that these associations hold large areas of urban land and that there is a building boom in Bangalore city.||Lelah Dushkin

One major source of actual conflict was the government demand on agriculture in the form of land revenue and water-rate. In fact almost all the peasant agitations in the Punjab during this period - the 1907 agitation in the canal colonies, the agitation in 1924 against increase in water-rate (which was stalled by timely concessions), the kisan sabha and other movements in the 1930s - were related to this problem. The question of indebtedness and the resultant tensions between debtors and moneylenders attracted a lot of attention. However, for various reasons, only the anti-traditional moneylender aspect of this tension was encouraged and focused on, while the role of the newly emerging agriculturist moneylenders was ignored. The paper also examined the existence of stratification within agrarian society, which was further accentuated by the growing differentiation, and its impact on relations between different sections of the agricultural community. The growing tendency towards landlordism and cultivation on batai or sharecropping basis had some implications for the dominant contemporary view of Punjab as a land of self-sufficient peasant proprietors. Lastly, the paper looks at the impact of the world depression, which seriously threatened a break-up of the whole fabric of the existing agrarian relations.||Mridula Mukherjee

15/3/1980- ||special articles||4368474||Theory of a Dual Mode of Production in Post-Colonial India||The debate over the mode of production in India has suffered from a tendency to focus individually on agriculture, industry, or imperialism - ignoring either the total context or local specificities. Mechanistic transplantation of concepts from elsewhere and black-and-white answers to such matters as the emergence of capitalism and post-colonial dependency have only served to confuse the picture. Tracing the historical antecedents of the present mode of production, this paper finds that an extremely heterogeneous pre-capitalist mode and later a colonial mode of production served to both lay the material basis for, and retard the development of, Indian capitalism. What has emerged from this distorted development is an interpenetration and integration of pre-capitalist and capitalist relations, generating not so much two independent modes as effectively a single mode with dual character (not to be confused with 'dualism'). Having at once both accommodating and conflicting internal dynamics, the dual mode has features of both stability and transition which can be analysed in terms of mixed relations and the patterns of dominance. In the current international context, India may be characterised as 'relatively politically independent, relatively economically dependent' and qualitatively differentiated, on the one hand, from the semi-colonial and neo-colonial models, and, on the other hand, from revolutionary states which have removed themselves from the world capitalist periphery. The paper is being published in two instalments. The first, published last week, briefly surveyed the historical antecedents of the present mode of production and reviewed the debate over the mode of product on in Indian agriculture that has taken place till now. In this, the second instalment, the author considers in detail the dynamics and relations of the process of transition in the dual mode of production and the implications of this dual mode hypothesis for India in its present context of post-colonial dependency.||Sharat G.

1/2/1980- ||technological options||4368377||Choice of Technology in the Sugar Industry||Can we objectively determine the trade-off between 'rate of return' and 'employment'? One could possibly go from the potential surplus to actual surplus using a marginal propensity to save and then employing a capital-output ratio to determine the future rate of growth in output and employment. Then this trade-off will be transformed into one between current and future employment. In all these exercises the question of the value judgment cannot be avoided. However, the calculations should be carried upto the point where the trade-offs are made explicit. And in so doing one ought to bring into proper focus all the relevant considerations. The Planning Commission's exercise relating to the sugar industry does not bring out explicitly the implications for rate of return. This is what the authors have done in this note by suitably modifying the programming exercise. It is also shown that for the given level of capital availability, it is possible to have a larger increase in output and employment than that determined by the Planning Commission.||C. Rangarajan,A.

The level of growth is nowhere near that reached even by the middle level industrialised countries even though the rate of saving and capital formation seems to be approaching their level. Why is it that in spite of a high rate of capital formation, the rate of growth is low and why is it that in spite of an increase in the rate of saving there is an increase in poverty? The objective of this paper is to see how far savings and capital formation in India have increased during the three decades of planning that we have had, to examine the effect these increases have had on economic growth and increase in national income, and to suggest possible changes in the strategy followed regarding savings, capital formation and their appropriate utilisation for realising the national objective of increasing economic growth for increasing economic welfare.||V.

So, to consolidate the rapprochement with China, the anomaly of confrontation on the Korean peninsula needs to be resolved. The murder of Park Chung-hee in October 1979 and the developments since then in South Korea, it is suggested in this note, have to be understood against this background.||David Boggett

Part I presents the social and economic rationale for encouraging decentralisation of industry and assisting the development of village and small industries in the Indian context. Part II is devoted to comments, mainly critical, on past performance of official measures to encourage and strengthen the small and village sector, and presents a series of suggestions for more positive action in the future. The last section briefly discusses the special problems of development of decentralised industries in backward areas.||L. C. Jain

Proportions of statewise production of seven oilseeds, and of their derived oils, are almost identical, showing that oilseeds are crushed mostly in the same states in which they are produced. Correlation with oilmill crushing capacity in each state is not as good, perhaps because ghani crushing and solvent extraction are not accounted for. Inter-state trading involves only some 5 to 10 per cent of the total production of major oilseeds and oils, and even this movement is mainly to contiguous areas which themselves produce and prize these materials, but fall short of their needs. The percentage of marketable surplus of an oilseed depends on its other outlets and varies greatly from one oilseed to another. The wholesale markets comprise three major levels, namely local markets, assembling or primary markets, and terminal markets. The operations in all of them are controlled by commission agents and brokers, and subject to considerable speculation. Peaks and troughs characterise the annual fluctuations in the prices of oils through the course of the year, obscured in certain years by unexpected events. Prices have tripled in the decade after 1964. In recent years price variations have been smaller for edible than for inedible oils.||S. Chandrasekaran,K. T. Achaya

To appraise the working of this policy instrument in actual practice, the authors have chosen for study the specific case of a foreign collaboration in electronics industry entered into by a public sector electronics unit for manufacture of an electronic component. In the process of examining how far export obligations are effectively enforceable, the authors also consider the linkage between export obligation and technology transfer. In part I of this paper the authors attempt to put together some background information on the frequency with which export obligation has been imposed by government in the case of foreign collaborations in electronics industry. In part II is given background information on the state of component manufacturing. Parts III and IV report the results of the case study.||I. S. Gulati,Swaraj K. Bansal

Its findings are that while the recommendations of the Working Group are themselves unsatisfactory in that they fail to touch upon some of the most crucial issues in block level planning, the 'operational guidelines' issued by the Planning Commission which are expected to determine the actual form of block level planning have further diluted the Working Group's recommendations. Hence it is likely that there will be a formal acceptance of block level planning, but its actual implementation in practice will be less likely.||Sandeep Bagchee,Aruna Bagchee

As members of the developing and oil importing world, we need to be conscious however that there is nothing sacrosanct about the present world monetary system which has served best the interests of the developed oil importing world. Indeed even the gains made by the OPEC countries by increases in oil prices have been more than eaten away by the increases in the prices of their imports from the developed Western countries. What should be of interest, however, is the more recent shift from the Euro-dollar to holdings of gold by the oil exporters and the consequences of gold by the oil exporters and the consequences of the relative difficulty they face in attempting this shift.||I.

This article, while broadly supporting the spirit and philosophy inherent in the Raj Narain scheme, proposes an alternative plan of community health service whose structure is more democratic, and whose working will be more responsive to the felt needs of the rural population.||Mark Nichter

But female migration might also be the result of broken marriages, widowhood, desertion and destitution. These and other related issues call for a more detailed investigation and analysis of female migration than has been so far attempted. This paper examines some of these issues on the basis of secondary data flowing from the 1971 Census of India and formulates issues for further investigation.||Mahendra K. Premi

05/4/1980- ||special articles||4368541||Class and Tribe in Jharkhand||The one feature common to many of the 19th century 'tribal' revolts against British rule in the region bordering the present West Bengal, Bihar and Orissa was that they were all specifically directed against 'outsiders'. The correspondence between the exploiters and the outsiders in this area was so stark that the tribal word 'diku' came to mean both the 'exploiter' and the 'outsider'. This article traces the evolution of the concept of 'diku' in the context of the Jharkhand movement which began as a movement in defence of tribal rights over land and, in more recent times, has taken the political form of a demand for an autonomous state of Jharkhand. Jharkhand presents the apparent paradox of being one of the most heavily industrialised areas in the country with an organised working class - a large proportion of which comprises immigrants - justly celebrated for its many glorious struggles in defence and advancement of working class rights, while at the same time the native population of the region, comprising the adivasis, continues to be among the most wretched sections in the state, and is generally both suspicious and envious of the working class. The article attempts to analyse this paradox and the political problem of bringing about an alliance of the worker and the tribal peasant in the region.||Nirmal Sengupta

For a country like India, the immediate impact was traumatic for all sectors of energy consumers. Two options are now open: (i) to keep augmenting supplies of fossil-fuel energy to match ever-increasing consumption (the hard path); and (ii) to conserve such non-renewable fossil-fuel sources of supply and tap increasingly the renewable sources (the soft path). The soft path is the more workable option for the industrial world as also for the Third World; though there will be immense difficulties in its acceptance and inevitable time-lags in its implementation. The industrial nations, the author argues, need to come forth to help the Third World adopt the soft path. They have the wherewithal to conduct research into the abundant base of renewable energy sources of the Third World countries, to develop appropriate equipment and appliances and to make them available on soft terms. Consumers and their organisations, particularly in the Third World, need to adopt concrete programmes aimed at creating awareness of the dimensions and implications of the energy crisis.

Its groundwater potential is today of the order of 2.5 million hectare-metres, adequate for year-round multiple cropping on the 6 million hectare area of the region. At present, barely two-fifths of the groundwater potential has been tapped and two-thirds of the cropping is done under unirrigated conditions. This paper reviews past and present trends in groundwater irrigation (Section I), analyses small and large farmers' preferences among various types of wells (Section II) and in the last section considers the factors that promote or impede the exploitation of groundwater resources. Its principal conclusion is that the programme of rural electrification would have only a marginal impact on groundwater exploitation in the east Gangetic plains unless due attention is paid to other infrastructural improvements, notably institutional reforms, flood control, drainage and communications.||B.

The aim of such research is to discover why some couples adopt family planning practices while others do not. This kind of research is, of course, useful to the policy-maker who is concerned with measures for reducing overall fertility; but it is insufficient for understanding family-size dynamics for, apart from fertility, two other factors, viz mortality and partitioning (which gives rise to new families), also play a crucial role in determining the size of the family. For understanding family-size variations, it is, therefore, necessary to study the phenomenon of partitioning. This paper is restricted in scope to studying differentials in rates of partitioning among house-holds belonging to different agrarian classes. The author's hypotheses are concerned with the economic rationale of partitioning or resistance to it and hence with the advantages and disadvantages springing from market forces, specific to different classes, which can arrest or promote partitioning.||N.

The present study, thus intended, is based on a cross-section analysis of farm management data of a millet-dominated region, in which interestingly enough wheat assumes the role of a cash crop. The study relates to foodgrains as a whole, but also individually to jowar, bajra and wheat. It makes use of disaggregated data for regression analysis to bring out the discontinuity in the relation between marketable surplus and output, and the role of market access as represented by weekly markets. The study also brings out the dependence of farmers on the market for consumption, and the role of payments and receipts in kind. The difference between marketed and marketable surplus is part of the larger issue of commercialisation. How the different classes of farmers participate in the process of commercialisation in the commodity sphere is explored here within the limitations of the data available. The study, however, does not bring out the total market involvement of farmers apart from foodgrains. The first section is introductory. The second presents the general picture of marketable and marketed surplus by size-classes. And the third gives some results of the regression analysis. The fourth deals with the market dependence of farm household. The final section contains concluding remarks.||M. V. Nadkarni

In the light of the growing energy shortage that the country faces gobar gas is being cited as having great potential for answering the energy needs of rural areas. In this climate it is relevant to explore the desirability of gobar gas technology from the village perspective since, after all, it is the farmer in the countryside who ultimately decides whether or not to invest in a gobar gas plant. This paper, based on the responses of residents of a village in Satara district called 'Sugao', attempts some general statements regarding the constraints on the adoption of gobar gas technology in rural areas. Its findings are that social, spatial, cultural and attitudinal criteria are as important as technical ones in the assimilation (or rejection) of new technology.||Hemalata Dandekar

05/4/1980- ||special articles||4368542||Indian Aid to Co-Developing Countries||India, which is in a position of dependency towards the industrialised States of the West and to the Soviet bloc, and which has been a recipient in the past of massive aid, is now conducting its own aid programme and forging relationships with some developing States. This suggests dependency upon India, or at least mutual dependency, and calls for a revision in the analysis about States such as India. While India's economic weakness and its role as an aid recipient has received a great deal of attention in literature, its growing role as an aid donor has not received the attention it deserves, nor the initiatives and changes since the sixties. India's new status in an international context is one which, is shared by a number of States, which in 30 years and with varying success, have developed economically to reach a stage where they can be called semi-industrialised, and perhaps effective 'middle-powers'. It should be clear however that the Indian case is not quite the same as that of Kenya, Nigeria, Iran or Brazil. The parallels end when the scope and depth of India's external involvements, including its aid programmes, are examined. There are two ways of viewing India's aid programmes: one which sees the Indian effort as part of India's legitimate desire to carry out the various resolutions of the UNCTAD II, III and IV Conferences, calling for increased economic co-operation among the developing states and a responsibility towards less-industrialised States by an India newly-industrialised. The other view sees Indian aid as yet another manifestation of India as an emergent power, playing an increasing role in world affairs - a role which will deepen in the future.||Srikant Dutt

Therefore to understand why energy requirements per unit value added are higher in India than in the other countries or even in India earlier, it is important to look at the product-mix and industrial uses to which energy is put and the technologies employed in production. This paper attempts such a study. It examines the reasons for the apparent high energy input in Indian industry's value-added. It also examines the pricing policy in energy followed in this country and recommends alternatives with a view to greater efficiency in energy employment.||Jyoti K. Parikh,Arun K. Chaitanya

However, in view of the small and uneconomic size of irrigated land held by such farmers, the benefits of the programme can accrue to them only if the technologies of raising groundwater resources can be shared. Equally important are appropriate organisational solutions to the many problems that will invariably rise in the implementation of such programmes. This paper considers the results of ongoing action research in this field in Ghazipur district, eastern Uttar Pradesh. It first considers two examples of 'hardware' solutions: the twin plunger irrigation handpump; and the irrigation windmill currently being developed in Ghazipur by a voluntary organisation. The paper concludes with a consideration of two organisational or 'software' solutions: mobile pumpsets shared between a group of farmers; and state, community or 'agency' tubewells.||P. B. Ghate

Such formations and relations have presented persistent problems to ruling elites seeking the consolidation of a modern bourgeois economy and centralised State. Land reforms and other measures in the Bhutto period did not seek to eradicate the 'feudals', as in a classic bourgeois revolution, nor abdicate power to them, as in 'indirect rule' or some forms of patron-client political systems, but rather sought selective accommodation and transformation to facilitate concentration of political power and rationalisation of the agricultural economy. The significant limitations apparent in the attack on feudalism must be understood in terms of the strategic and tactical imperatives operative during the period of Bhutto's rule.||Ronald J. Herring

State and funding agencies are increasingly concerned with better pay-off on their investments, in terms of "social development" or "social advance".

Its chief findings are that the rural scene in Tamil Nadu is far from static, and that the rural areas have experienced a new dynamism unknown in the past. The changes have however been induced changes, frequently brought about as a result of decisions taken outside the rural areas. While some of these changes have been in the desired direction, others have not been. The negative aspects of these changes include the tendency for the small farmers to become progressively pauperised, the decline in the real wages of agricultural labourers, and the continuance and increase of mass poverty. In other words, while there has undoubetdly been 'development' in rural Tamil Nadu, such 'development' has only generated growth and affluence for the few and poverty and insecurity for the many.||C.

This paper, while noting all the constraints in the path of economic development of India, argues that taking the Indian experience as a whole since Independence, such a negative assessment is not warranted. Many social and economic indicators - the growth and diversification of the country's trade, increase in food production, decline in the proportion of foreign aid to net national product, the degree of control exercised by the State over the functioning of the transnationals, the growth of scientific and technological manpower, etc - suggest that India's performance compares well with that of many underdeveloped countries. The foundations for this growth were laid in the Second Five-Year Plan formulated under the guidance of Jawaharlal Nehru.||Vijay Laxman Kelkar

It shows both the 'portfolio' rates of return on such investment and the individual-share rates of return. The returns are overall returns, including dividends and capital appreciation, after adjusting for bonus and 'rights' shares issued. They have been computed for holding periods of various lengths, upto a maximum of 16 years. The study covers the variability or uncertainty aspect of the rate of return, both in terms of dispersion over individual securities and, more importantly, in terms of dispersion over time. The attempt is to view the return and risk characteristics together because any comparison among competing forms of investment must take into account both. The study fills an important gap in the available data, particularly relating to the structure of interest rates. Equity securities should be viewed as forming part of the spectrum of financial assets; and equity rates of return, as part of the spectrum of yields. The study goes into the characteristics of the equity returns and attempts to enquire how these characteristics are connected with the behaviour and attitudes of the market participants for the risky class of financial assets.||L.

The resurgence of so many different separate and separatist political, nationalist, ethnic, traditionalist and religious movements, many in response to very varied perceptions of social and personal crisis, might suggest that the world consists of, or is breaking up into, little pieces, each of which is reaffirming its traditional culture and life. An alternative suggestion, advanced by the author, is that most of these movements are little more than desperate reactions - and often with reactionary consequences - to the varied sensations of crisis generated by the development of a single world system, which is itself in a crisis of development, as it rapidly engulfs all the inhabitants of the entire globe. This alternative suggestion arises out of a study, summarised in this paper, of the historical development of the capitalist world system and its spread to incorporate all parts of the globe.||Andre Gunder Frank

Both these developments reflected the wider spread of political consciousness and democratisation of politics which had been taking place, before and after the acceptance of adult franchise and a republican constitution in 1950. The economic development of Maharashtra, with the great concentration of industry and business and the service sector in Bombay and its suburbs, shows that, in spite of their protestations to the contrary, the political leadership hailing from the affluent sections in the rural areas has made its peace with the Indian big business, at the expense of the common people in the city of Bombay and in the countryside. This paper analyses political and economic developments in Maharashtra since independence. Sections I and II, published last week, dealt with developments of the early post-independence period upto the formation of the separate state of Maharashtra in 1960 and sections III and IV, which appear below, discuss developments in the post-1960 period.||A.

Anthropologists not only come at development problems from the perspective of the people, they also tend to try to understand particular projects as parts of a larger system. And very frequently, it is the system of social relations and cultural understandings that is critical for the success or failure of projects.||David G. Mandelbaum

It is towards this task that the International Federation of Institutes for Advanced Study (IFIAS) launched a project, entrusting it to a select team of scholars from a cross-section of countries. The following article gives the background of that study and the results of the team's work.||

In examining the impact of the planned increases in dairy productivity on farmers' uses of scarce feedstuffs, the paper concludes that to increase India's milk production rapidly within the next few years using the limited feed resources available, a small proportion of the indigenous herd must be replaced gradually by high-yielding animals which are more efficient converters of feed into milk. Despite the fact that feedstuffs available are not sufficient to meet the scientific feed requirements of the existing herd, the efficiency with which these feedstuffs are used can be increased to meet the country's growing demand for milk.||Tushaar Shah,A.

Hence it is not surprising that the World Bank, the most ardent champion of free trade and foreign investment, is also one of the most ardent supporters of transfer of technologies to underdeveloped countries with a view to assisting the eventual development of indigenous technologies. This paper attempts to analyse the theory and practice of the World Bank in the development of indigenous productive forces in the fertiliser industry in India. Its findings are that World Bank project aid actually frustrates real transfer of technology, even though the rhetoric of the Bank continues to be permeated with the need for such transfer of technology to take place. Indeed, the purpose of all tied aid is to further strengthen the bonds of technological dependence under the guise of 'interdependence', thus reinforcing the subordinate position of underdeveloped countries in an international division of labour dictated by imperialism.||Usha Menon

29/11/1980- ||review of management, november 1980||4369268||International Dimensions of Indian Banking||During the last few years, Indian banks have shown growing interest in internationalising their business activities. Several new offices have been opened in foreign countries. Funds have been raised and disbursed in terms of foreign currencies. A wide range of international banking services have been offered, and the growing list of customers includes Indians as well as non-Indians abroad. Funds have been provided for trading with or by India, as also for economic development in India and other countries. Funds have been raised and disbursed unilate ally as well as in association with other Indian and non-Indian banks. In this paper we propose to examine the nature and significance of the international operations of Indian banks in the furtherance of their business strategies. The paper is broadly divided into four parts. In the first part we shall identify the various forms of the banks' national business and the cumulative effect of the same on the Indian banking system. In the second part we shall examine what has prompted Indian banks to undertake overseas operations and how these fit in with the individual corporate strategies of the banks concerned. In the third part, we shall examine the significance of these move from a national viewpoint. Finally, we shall take a look at the likely future developments in the context of foreseeable environmental changes and the areas in which steps might have to be thought of by individual bank managements and by the government and the Reserve Bank for regulation of the banking system.||G.

What lends added piquancy to this development is that the rate of economic growth during this period has been woefully below what the high rates of savings and investment would lead one to expect. It is, therefore, necessary to take critical look at the rise in the rates of savings and investment.||S. L. Shetty,K. A. Menon

02/8/1980- ||special articles||4368926||North-South and East-West Keynesian Paradoxes: Brandt Commission's Report||In his introduction to the Brandt Commission's report, the Commission's chairman, Willy Brandt, emphasises that the report cannot be a technical document but that it must offer far-reaching "bold initiatives" of political education. Yet the only significant bold initiatives to forge new instruments of mutual North-South interest are limited to short-run technical financial problems. The Commission believes that present and foreseeable medium-run difficulties are more serious than past recessions or crises and that it would be "dangerous and insincere to suggest they can be overcome with the conventional tools of previous decades". Yet the principal remedy proposed is the global application of the most conventional Keynesian remedies of the previous decades. As for the Brandt Commission's proposals for long-run programmes, and most particularly with regard to armaments, the mutual interest of North and South or East and West or indeed even within the West (or South or East) militates against their recognition and implementation. With nothing better than ideological survival programmes, Keynes was probably right to say that in the long-run we are all dead.||Andre Gunder Frank

Further, its relative position in this respect has not changed favourably and significantly in the last two decades. This clearly indicates the importance of agriculture and the relative poverty of farmers in the country. One way to develop agriculture is by formulating and implementing an appropriate agricultural prices policy which, in one form or another, has been in operation since the end of the second world war. This paper presents a brief review of agricultural prices policy and examines its impact on the incomes of farmers in India. Its findings are what while price support policy has played a positive role in raising farm incomes, the extent of this role has been inadequate and there has consequently been no significant improvement in the contribution of agriculture to national income.||G.

Return on net worth is a very sound concept but it should be seen along with other concepts like turnover of capital and utilisation of surplus. Further, published accounts of companies on historical cost basis need to be supplemented with inflation-proofed results in determining the size of the surplus. Whereas in the past only arbitrary methods were available for monitoring the impact of inflation on corporate results, more recent research has shown that one can be more scientific in this regard.||Rabbi

1/10/1980- ||small industry overview||4369156||Capitalism in India and the Small Industries Policy||It is instructive to look at the genesis of what has come to be known as the small industries development policy and to see whether it was at all possible in the early 1950s, given the already existing strength of large industry, for any government to have appreciably increased the strength of cottage and other small industry - and thus to have provided the jobs which, it is claimed, the policy actually implemented did not. For this purpose, we must examine the Congress's original views on the pattern of development it wished to see; the results of almost 20 years of debate following the 1929 Karachi resolution; and the opposition these views faced once Independence was a reality - both from large industrialists and from large landholders. Attempts were made by the large industrialists to bring about direct changes in policy, while the large landholders tried to preserve their economic and social interests through intervention largely at the more detailed policy-making stage and at the time of implementation. Though both types of obstruction had an impact on the final shape of the small industries policy, it is with the former that this paper is principally concerned.||Nasir Tyabji

1/2/1980- ||alliances for eighties||4368368||Rising Middle Peasantry in North India||An important feature of social change in the northern states has been the decline in 'semi-feudal' production relations. The shifting alignments between various sections of the rural population have only reflected the actual fact of the changing production relations as well as the attempts by those who are adversely affected by these changes to reverse the process. Analysing the results of the recent Lok Sabha polls in the north, particularly in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, this article argues that even though the polls dramatically restored Indira Gandhi and her party to power at the Centre, this victory cannot mean the return to power of the 'semi-feudal' interests (who broadly supported the party led by Indira Gandhi) in these areas; indeed, any elections for the state assemblies might produce results quite different from those of last month's Lok Sabha polls.||Pradhan H.

In the minds of many observers, the disruption and its immediate cause, the Karpoori Thakur ministry's reservation policy, are indicative of a sea-change in the structure of Bihar's political economy: the 'Forwards' or 'twice-born' caste groups that had been dominant in Bihar since independence and before are being replaced by the 'Backward' castes as the dominant stratum in the state. This essay examines the evidence of such a shift in the structure of dominance in Bihar and its implication for the political economy of the state.||Harry W. Blair

On the crucial question of land alienation which is a major problem faced by the tribals, its findings are that the present legal provisions to prevent such land alienation are adequate and even the implementation of these provisions, in respect of lands alienated illegally, has been more or less satisfactory. What is however less satisfactory has been the implementation of these provisions in respect of land 'legally' alienated from the tribal people. The article also finds that the government's resolution on regularisation of the encroachments on forest and government lands by tribals is full of deficiencies and deprives of the majority of tribal encroachers of the intended benefit.||S.

26/1/1980- ||special articles||4368358||Case for an Expenditure Tax||A fairly high rate of wealth taxation in addition to a progressive income-tax co-existing with large-scale tax evasion is prima facie evidence of the failure of the design of the present tax system and the policy underlying it. The author argues for a more comprehensive system of direct taxes in place of the existing system. The guiding principles of the new system should b the enlargement of the base coupled with more moderation in the rates of income-tax (both personal and corporate), simplification of several provisions and greater emphasis than hitherto on the objective of directly reducing disparities in the standards of current consumption. The comprehensive system should contain a personal income-tax with lower rates, a net worth tax, a direct tax on non-essential consumption, a simplified tax on capital gains, a gifts tax and a more moderate corporate profits tax coupled with a tax on indirect expenditures of corporations. The enlargement of the base would make possible reduction in marginal and average rates and improve the horizontal equity of the system without reducing effective progression. The shift from the income base to the expenditure base would, besides mitigating the harmful effects and inequities of a non-comprehensive unadjusted income-tax, serve to reduce extravagant consumption and promote savings to a significantly larger extent than the present system. Another gain would be the placing of a part of personal taxation on a family basis without imposing high marginal burdens on the incomes of working wives. Finally, the changes suggested in the system of depreciation and capital gains taxation would make for administrative simplification without loss of revenue.||Raja J. Chelliah

Comparisons are difficult, because data are incomplete and evidence is preliminary. The Indian tractor industry is relatively young (and Indian tractor technology even younger) so that time periods for comparison are limited. Notwithstanding these problems a picture can be created, indistinct in some details but clear in broad outline. That picture suggests that even in the real world of the factory, boardroom, and market place, indigenous technology does measure up. The picture also suggests that inappropriate foreign technology can be a powerful stimulus to indigenous technology generation because of the demands of this real world.||Ward Morehouse

To attribute these unpleasant realities to mere 'false consciousness' on the part of Indians or to the British policy of 'divide and rule' is only a partial explanation of the phenomenon; the growth of communalism has to be related more fundamentally to the structural changes in the polity and the uneven development of various communities in British India. This paper seeks to examine the growth of communalism in two provinces of British India, Bengal and the Punjab, from such a perspective. Its central argument is that the political changes initiated by the Act of 1919 encouraged communal alignments and further strengthened existing communal solidarities. The devolution of political power, so vociferously demanded by the nationalists, ironically widened the divisions in Indian society and hampered the socio-economic integration of various castes and communities.||Mushirul Hasan

13/12/1980- ||special articles||4369335||Peasant Struggles and Land Reforms in Malabar||The history of land reforms in India shows that far from being a gift from an enlightened government, the modest reforms that have till now been legislated (though poorly, if at all, implemented) have been the outcome of long and protracted struggles by the peasants. This paper briefly chronicles such a struggle, lasting over a century, by the peasants of Malabar in present-day Kerala. Its conclusion is that even though Kerala has a relatively better record than many other states both in the legislation and implementation of land reform measures, the process is far from complete. Indeed, former tenants who now own land are not always themselves cultivators of this land. The economic and social changes induced by the land reform measures have also affected the middle peasantry which has chiefly benefited from these measures. Hence, land reform cannot be said to have been achieved till the vast masses of agricultural labourers most of whom remain landless even today actually come to possess the land on which they work.||P.

1/2/1980- ||alliances for eighties||4368369||Electoral Participation of Minorities and Indian Political System||The support extended by large sections of the Muslims, the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes to Indira Gandhi has generally been acknowledged to have contributed significantly to her victory in the recent Lok Sabha polls. But contrary to popular impression, the votes of these sections are not always purchased by 'contractors' and delivered, at a price, to the political aspirant; the voting pattern of these minority communities is determined by their limited perception of certain concrete situations and issues - security of life and property and bread and butter issues. Thus it is significant that even though the organised leadership of the Muslims in the form of the 'National Muslim Front' as well as many notable leaders of the RPI and the Dalit Panthers openly supported Jagjivan Ram, it was Indira Gandhi who finally cornered the votes; and an analysis of the voting figures shows that in constituencies where Muslims constitute between 20 and 40 per cent of the population, the alliance around the Lok Dal and the Congress (U) and comprising the Left groups together polled more votes than even the Congress (I). The lesson is clear. It is possible and, indeed, essential, to organise the minorities on economic issues; and the masses among the minorities themselves perceive that the solution to the 'minority problem' in India lies in a socialist agrarian revolution. But as things stand, the choice posed before them is between two reactionary ideologies: peasant Gandhism on the one hand and casteism and communal obscurantism on the other.||Moin Shakir

The problem in Assam is not whether the linguistic, religious and ethnic minorities will swamp the Assamese but whether the Assamese people will see clearly the strength of their numbers and the maturity of their culture to gain the confidence of these minorities so as to peacefully integrate them into the Assamese nation.||K.

By far the greater part of the funds for improving the nutritional levels of the people is spent on feeding programmes, especially school meals. These programmes have failed to show any impact in the past primarily because they are not supported by sanitary inputs and further are addressed at the wrong point of time in the growth of the child. The way to improve levels of living and nutrition status in particular, is to develop social and economic action through community measures. Two examples of such community projects are given in the paper.||P. V. Sukhatme

30/8/1980- ||review of management, august 1980||4369016||Non-Formal Education among Workmen: An Experiment in Ahmedabad||The formal education system has registered impressive growth since independence. But a mere increase in gross enrolment figures or development of physical facilities can only be a crude measure of expansion of education. Improvement of educational standards, or even removal of illiteracy, cannot be ensured by mere increased allocations; what is crucial is innovative experimentation in areas of pedagogy. This paper gives an account of such an attempt at 'innovative experimentation' undertaken among adult workers of certain small industries in Ahmedabad. The work was initiated by some volunteers at the instance of workmen themselves, and at every stage consciously tried to avoid becoming 'prescriptive'. The workers themselves initiated, slowly and reluctantly in the beginning and more surely later, the various stages of their learning process. It is recognised that this process of education should at some stage go beyond the confines of the worker's immediate work and life experiences and involve diverse elements of social knowledge, history and technology; and of necessity, this aspect of workers' education has to be undertaken by persons other than the oppressed workers. But the experiment (which lasted for about eight months) was too short to discover the appropriate stages at which and the forms in which this has to come about.||Girja Sharan

In these writings, Kerala appears as a 'cheap' model for development. This could easily be used to support the view that those in Western countries who are concerned about conditions in the third world can now have their cake and eat it too; they can ease their consciences by encouraging patterns of development which will neither involve large transfers of funds from the wealthier countries to the poorer, nor rock the boat in which we are all sitting. The purpose of this paper is to examine in some detail to what extent optimistic statements about the 'miracle' of Kerala will hold up under closer scrutiny. This is done through an examination of the conditions of life of agricultural labourers. Specifically, the following aspects are examined: (a) health and fertility; (b) fertility and employment; (c) land reform; (d) nutrition; (e) education and literacy; and (f) other public facilities.||Joan P.

Three streams of migrants are studied: out-migrants, in-migrants and return-migrants. The analysis suggests that all three flows are on the rise in Punjab's green revolution areas. Out-migration from the rural areas is dominated by the poorest and the richest and information on the reasons for migration confirms the link between migration and economic factors. The rate of out-migration from the rural areas is higher than the combined rate of in-migration and return-migration, suggesting that some of the shortage of labour reported from the region may be due to migration and not to new methods of agriculture. The data suggest that, in terms of human capital, rural areas of the region are getting depleted of their more resourceful elements. Against this, there is a compensatory inflow into the rural areas of remittances which supplements capital formation and investment in productive activities. The proportion of scheduled and low caste people in the rural population of Ludhiana district is gradually increasing as a result of migration. Ludhiana district, because of its achievement in agriculture, is attracting people from other districts of Punjab and also from the other states. These flows are not considerable at present, but are portending to become more marked with the passage of time.||A. S. Oberai,H. K. Manmohan Singh

No organisation can work on everything simultaneously. It has a problem of choice created by its own belief in its versatility. The organisation will have to redefine its objectives and lay down the criteria on the basis of which these choices will be made so that the sum total of the sectors on which it works will form a coherent whole. Some organisations, in an attempt to conform to this character of management education, do not think this through. They react to short-term demands and are drawn into working on problems in many sectors with little forethought as to where all this will lead. Institutions concerned with management education in India, therefore, need more than an objective. They need a vision - to be able to view the nation's operating system as an integrated whole.||Ravi J. Matthai

This paper attempts to study the role of foreign capital in the economy of these countries. Section I examines the various forms such investment has taken and Section II attempts to evaluate the overall impact of such investment, especially in the light of the proclaimed economic objectives set by the ASEAN countries themselves. Its conclusion is that though the inflow of foreign capital might have contributed to a relatively high rate of growth of national and per capita incomes, there has been little impact on the basic economic structures of these countries. This, the paper argues, has been necessarily so because foreign capital can never stimulate long term economic growth.||Pradeep Kumar Mehta,Atul Sarma

The author discusses in detail the lines that have to be drawn around the concept. She first looks at the border with that which is not Urban, then at that which is not Economic, and finally with that which is not Formal. The practical difficulties in setting these boundaries and some of the implications for analysis of having done so are discussed and a series of reminders are issued of what tends to get left out. The author then turns to the motley creature that is nevertheless left inside and makes a few illustrative references to how theorising, empirical studies and policy-making might take its complexity and diversity into account. The conclusions are summarised at the end. Where appropriate the author has tried to illustrate her arguments with references to empirical studies, mostly the two on which she herself has worked - Bombay and Abidjan.||Heather Joshi

It is undoubtedly related to the national question, the weakest link of the Indian polity today, which interventionist foreign conspiracies find worth exploiting. In this article, the author of "Planter Raj to Swaraj: Freedom Struggle and Electoral Politics 1826-47" (New Delhi, 1977), looks beyond his period and attempts at analysing the movement in its several aspects and draws some conclusions. The theory that the Asamiya national culture is in danger is more a myth than a reality now. The movement is motivated otherwise. It is not spontaneous, nor are students its originators. Its ideological and organisational roots are in the Asamiya upper classes who control the state's powerful local press. They planned and began to co-ordinate its preparations since about 1978. The author concludes that the movement is national in form, chauvinist and undemocratic in content and proto-fascist in its methods. It has two faces - one, non-violent and peaceful, turned towards Delhi; and the other, coercive and often violent, turned towards the dissident minorities. The solution of the foreigners' issue lies mostly in assimilation and in the sealing-off of the Bangladesh border rather than in deportation. One good thing coming out of the many bad things connected with the movement may be the disillusionment of the people about their middle class leadership and its objectives which has started.||Amalendu Guha

19/7/1980- ||special articles||4368873||Bombay Communists and the 1924 Textile Strike||The recent publications of many kinds of source material on the beginnings of the Indian communist movement, including hitherto classified intelligence reports, creates the impression that the communist movement in those early days was a very powerful political force. The fact that in 1924, there was both a major strike in the Bombay textile mills and the launching of the Kanpur Conspiracy Case reinforces this impression of a well-organised, secret communist movement posing grave dangers to the government, and both the government and Communist Party leaders, for different reasons, seek to establish a causal relation between the two. This paper, based on contemporary sources, argues that the Kanpur case, which was already being planned before the textile workers' strike broke out, was launched primarily from an official frame of mind that was obsessed with the perceived dangers of Soviet Russia, and not with any dangers posed by the fledgling communist movement of that period. It was only after 1924 that communist workers in Bombay and elsewhere became closely involved with working class struggles which culminated in the famous general strikes of 1928 and 1929, and the Meerut Conspiracy Case.||Dick Kooiman

1/2/1980- ||technological options||4368376||International Technology Market and Developing Countries||This paper provides a brief description of the process of international transfer of technology to developing countries (DCs). It is not intended to be a comprehensive survey of the literature, but to discuss in simple terms the various themes that have concerned scholars of this problem and to point to some interesting issues that are just assuming importance. The ramifications of technological transfer and generation are very wide. The direct and indirect costs of technology imports have major implications for the DCs' balance of payments. The mode of technology transfer also affects the extent to which an independent industrial capability can be built up. The nature of the technology utilised influences linkages with the traditional sectors, distribution of the benefits of economic growth, and use of the resource endowments, of the DCs, themselves. The fostering of indigenous capabilities to absorb, reproduce, and improve the imported technology determines the long-term comparative advantage built up by the Third World - and hence the extent to which genuine self-reliance can be achieved by it. Clearly, therefore this is an area which must be the focus of any serious effort to promote the industrialisation of developing countries.||Sanjaya Lall

Most definitions of a plantation tend to overlook these relations which emerge from the plantation as a social system. This paper, based on the findings of fieldwork conducted among tea plantation workers in the Dooars in North Bengal, attempts a sociological definition of the plantation system. The uniqueness of a plantation system lies in its social and production relations. These no doubt have changed since the days of plantation economies of colonial times and are changing even now; but the change in these relations is determined by the context of isolation of the plantantion from the wider social system, the influence of the working class organisations among the workers and the role of the State.||Sharit Kumar Bhowmik

According to these estimates, the per capita intake of calories in 1971-72 for the country as a whole was considerably lower than the level in 1961-62; though the national average registered some increase by 1973-74, it was still much below the level in 1961-62. The extent of decline in calorie intake has however varied significantly between different regions. Why has the calorie intake fallen despite an increase in per capita production of cereals by the early seventies? What factors account for the inter-state variations? These are some of the questions examined in this paper.||P. G. K. Panikar

08/11/1980-15/11/1980||special articles||4369211||Dairy Development in India: Some Critical Issues||A great deal of progress has been made towards dairy development on sound lines, but certain basic questions would still bear emphasis. The chief of these is how the energy input-output ratio can be kept as favourable as possible in the absence of sufficient pastureland by which to reduce the cost of animal feeding. In turn this raises the question of whether grain and concentrate feeds will be available in sufficient quantity and at low enough cost to sustain the genetic potential of high-yielding animals, and whether this can be achieved through a total food system in which animals compete minimally with man for foods that both can consume. The answer to this may well set the limit to the degree of dairy development possible. Another important question is that of how to preserve the symbiosis between dairying and agriculture (that has been all but lost in advanced countries) so as to provide a low cost energy system. The small area of most agricultural land holdings mean that dairy animals can only be maintained in small numbers, and this would facilitate better utilisation of agricultural waste. Another matter that is important is to work out procedures for costing milk in a realistic way under various situations, so that price always acts as a stimulus to sustained dairy development. Nutritional considerations overwhelmingly show that milk is indispensable only for infants (when breast milk is for any reason lacking) and that adults can well do without milk in terms of nutrition-cum-economics. Thus conscious attempts are called for to ensure that milk reaches as far as possible the most vulnerable groups rather than simply those who can afford to buy it. Modren technology needs constantly to be reviewed for ideas that favour the Indian situation, such as the development of UHT milk that stores for six months without refrigeration, or the extending of milk supplies using oilseed proteins. The impressive strides that dairy development has made need to be sustained through constant scholarly evaluation and mid-course correction of directions or emphasis.||Vinod K. Huria,K. T. Achaya

The period of study is 1817-1981, but the emphasis is on the changes in the demographic pattern of Assam since 1947. Its chief findings are: (1) Since 1951, the rate of increase of Assam's population has been much higher than that of the country as a whole or of any state or province. But unlike in other states, this heavy increase has been due to (a) an acceleration of the natural rate of increase; (b) influx of Hindu refugees from East Pakistan; and (c) heavier migration of Indians from the rest of the country. (2) The tremendous swelling in the number of the Assamese speaking population during 1911-31 as a consequence of people belonging to other language groups adopting Assamese language is a unique instance of its kind. (3) Apprehensions about the infiltration of Bangladeshi or East Pakistani Muslims into Assam appear not to be supported by facts. The fact is that while it was mainly the Bengali Muslims, motivated by economic as well as political factors, who migrated to Assam between 1891 and 1947, such migration as has taken place since 1947, almost entirely due to political reasons, has been of Bengali Hindus.||Susanta Krishna Dass

An attempt is made at the outset to examine the problems of deriving estimates of OPEC's investible resources. A review is then made of the actual dimensions of OPEC's investments abroad, their geographical disposal, and composition. The logic of this prevailing pattern of investment, within the perception of OPEC portfolio managers, is also reviewed. In conclusion some crude estimates are made of the returns to OPEC on their investment portfolio and the opportunity costs of this investment to their respective economies. A brief note of the implications of attempting to realign prevailing investment patterns is also attempted.||Rahman Sobhan

01/3/1980- ||special articles||4368430||Potential of Industrial Revolution in Pre-British India||The question whether India was on the threshold of an 'industrial revolution' at the time of the colonisation of the country has been endlessly debated, with various economic historians (even those of Marxist persuasion) coming to widely different conclusions. This article starts from the premise that while economic categories - the extent of commodity production, wage labour, monetarisation of the economy, etc - should be the basis for any analysis of the production relations of pre-British India, it is the nature of class struggles arising out of particular class alignments that finally gives the decisive twist to social change. Arguing on this premise, and analysing the available evidence, this article concludes that there was little potential for industrial revolution before the British arrived in India because, whatever might have been the character of economic categories of that period, the class relations had not sufficiently matured to develop productive forces and the required class struggle for a 'revolution' to take place.||Shaibal Gupta

Section I deals with the recent trends in manufactured exports by region, Section II with the products exported and studies of the comparative advantage underlying the observed patterns, Section III with market penetration into the developed countries, and Section IV with the main agents responsible for export growth, with special reference to the role of multinational companies.

03/5/1980- ||special articles||4368628||Informal Sector: Concept and Policy||A major part of the economy of a developing country consists of small and tiny production organisations run on informal, self-employment basis. The following is a discussion of the various attributes of the urban informal sector as set out in the literature on the subject. What emerges is that it is difficult to distinctly identify the informal sector as an analytical category. However, it is clear that a sizeable segment of the urban economy run in this way suffers from severe infrastructural, marketing and technological handicaps, and is consequently characterised by low productivity and earnings of those engaged in it. Yet, for policy purposes, it is important to delineate this informal sector so as to mitigate the disadvantages it suffers, to increase its absorption capacity for in-migrants into the city, to improve its productivity, and to improve the working conditions of its workers. Finally, a growth pattern has to be evolved dovetailing the formal and informal sectors so as to glean their maximum respective advantages and narrow the existing cleavage between them in terms of conditions of growth and of work in them.||T.

08/3/1980- ||special articles||4368450||Theory of a Dual Mode of Production in Post-Colonial India||The debate over the mode of production in India has suffered from a tendency to focus individually on agriculture, industry, or imperialism - ignoring either the total context or local specificities. Mechanistic transplantation of concepts from elsewhere and black-and-white answers to such matters as the emergence of capitalism and post-colonial dependency have only served to confuse the picture. Tracing the historical antecedents of the present mode of production, this paper finds that an extremely heterogeneous pre-capitalist mode and later a colonial mode of production served to both lay the material basis for, and retard the development of, Indian capitalism. What has emerged from this distorted development is an interpenetration and integration of pre-capitalist and capitalist relations, generating not so much two independent modes as effectively a single mode with dual character (not to be confused with 'dualism'). Having at once both accommodating and conflicting internal dynamics, the dual mode has features of both stability and transition which can be analysed in terms of mixed relations and the patterns of dominance. In the current international context, India may be characterised as 'relatively politically independent, relatively economically dependent' and qualitatively differentiated, on the one hand, from the semi-colonial and neo-colonial models, and, on the other hand, from revolutionary states which have removed themselves from the world capitalist periphery. The paper is being published in two instalments. The first, published this week, briefly surveys the historical antecedents of the present mode of production and goes on to review the debate over the mode of production in Indian agriculture that has taken place till now. The second instalment, which will be published next week, considers in detail the dynamics and relations of the process of transition in the dual mode of production and the implications of this dual mode hypothesis for India in its present context of post-colonial dependency.||Sharat G.
