The study underlines how creative aspects of the planning process can suffer if planning is reduced to a mechanistic target-setting and budgeting exercise with or without formal use of environmental data. It is widely recognised that long range planning is the responsibility of top management. This is because the key notes of long range planning are creativity and judgment. It is maintained, therefore, that the role of formal analysis in long range planning is at best marginal. The intangible ingredients-creativity and judgment-do not lend themselves to any formal analysis. We entirely agree with the first assertion. But we have reservations in accepting the second proposition. We maintain, on the contrary, that a use of formal analytical framework is helpful in a judicious exercise of judgment and in pinpointing areas of creative thinking. The case study of Praja Bank supports this statement.||V. L. Mote,B. G. Shah

The operational consequences of these concepts are then described. Finally, the major kinds of information to be scanned are listed and the approaches used to analyse and forecast these major external forces are described.||Philip Thomas
