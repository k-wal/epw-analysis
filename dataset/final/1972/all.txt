19/2/1972- ||special articles||4361047||What Sort of Incentives for Exports?||The mid-term appraisal of the Fourth Plan not only fails to take note of the implications of the disappointing export performance in the first two years of the Plan, it goes further to cling uncritically to the impossible 7 per cent annual rate of export growth for the entire Plan period. Yet the fact is that exports have increased at less than 5 per cent per annum under the Plan so far. And unless suitable policy measures are taken, the near-stagnancy in exports is likely to continue. The country lost an opportunity recently to adjust its exchange rate to a more realistic level of a far lower gold parity. By opting instead for a deepening maze of concealed as well as direct export subsidies and for a gradual withdrawal of export duties, the Government has not only chosen to put the exports sector at the mercy of administrative rules of thumb and of pressure groups lobbying for ever-increasing concessions, but has allowed whole quantities of foreign exchange - earned via the import replenishment scheme - to stay outside its allocative control. An alternative the Government still has before it, according to this paper, is the dual exchange rate - which, while it gives preference to the exports sector, at the same time both brings the foreign exchange earned directly under control of the authorities and does away with bureaucratic discretion.||Nandita Pant

Technology transfer may be logically broken down into three broad stage: (i) transfer of information on the farmers' needs for new technology to the research system, (ii) transfer of research results to developmental agencies, and (iii) transfer of these results to the farmers-frequently in the form of new agricultural development programmes. The three groups which primarily interact in the three-stage process are thus the research organisations, the extension or development agencies, and the farmers. Interaction between these groups takes the form of flows of physical resources and funds, on the one hand, and communication flows, on the other. This paper is concerned with the communication linkages relevant to the transfer of agricultural technology. It examines what variables influence the smoothness and effectiveness of communication flows. While outlining various approaches that could usefully reshape the environment for communication linkages, the paper underscores the need for a basic change in terms of projecting the farmer as the end-user and reference point in the entire communication system for technology transfer.||Radha C.

The concentration of income among the assessees under personal income taxation in India showed a tendency to fall over the years 1951-52 to 1964-65, and this mainly explains the falling tendency of the overall rate of tax to fall over these years. Progression in the rate structure of personal income tax makes the concentration ratio, calculated from the distribution of disposable income, lower than the concentration ratio, calculated from the distribution of income before taxation. The ratio of the concentration ratio before taxation to concentration ratio after taxation may be used to obtain some idea of the effectiveness of progression in the tax rates. This ratio of the two concentration ratios calculated from the data of personal income tax assessments, showed a tendency to fall during 1955-56 to 1964-65. This tendency shows that the effectiveness of progression in the personal income-tax rates weakened over time.||Anupam Gupta

25/3/1972- ||review of agriculture, march 1972||4361169||A Strategy for Dry Land Agriculture||In the wake of the green revolution, the regional disparities in the farm sector threaten to get accentuated. The factor endowments of the regions vary vastly and so also their capacity to take advantage of the new technology which has ushered in the green revolution. The dry areas, in particular, stand automatically neglected under the country's new strategy with its bias for areas with assured water. Even in the past (i e, prior to the HYV programme) the dry areas suffered relative neglect because the agricultural production programmes, basically evolved for well watered areas, almost completely disregarded the problems and potential of the dry areas. Consequently, while agriculture in other areas developed fast, its performance in the dry areas showed gradual decline. The present paper illustrates the above situation with respect to the arid region of Rajasthan which covers nearly three-fifths of the state. After examining the growth retarding implications of the present approach, it argues that a meaningful development strategy for the dry areas can be evolved only in the context of the limitations and potentialities of the dry lands. A tentative approach has been suggested which emphasises production activities in which dry lands have a comparative advantage vis-a-vis other areas.

This paper argues that most of the criticisms directed against these projections are misplaced for the reason that they attempt to place them in a strait-jacket of preconceived ideas and theories. The author also examines the hidden assumptions underlying these exercises. Once these assumptions are relaxed, a whole host of problems arise which have to be at least recognised, if not solved, if the monetary projection exercises have to have any operational significance. This caution is warranted, particularly because the impression is likely to be created, not consciously perhaps, that the projections are inviolate truths.

26/2/1972- ||review of management, february 1972||4361071||Concept of Planning: A Case Study||In this paper we cite a case study of "planning" at the Ahmedabad Branch of the Praja Bank. The study underlines how creative aspects of the planning process can suffer if planning is reduced to a mechanistic target-setting and budgeting exercise with or without formal use of environmental data. It is widely recognised that long range planning is the responsibility of top management. This is because the key notes of long range planning are creativity and judgment. It is maintained, therefore, that the role of formal analysis in long range planning is at best marginal. The intangible ingredients-creativity and judgment-do not lend themselves to any formal analysis. We entirely agree with the first assertion. But we have reservations in accepting the second proposition. We maintain, on the contrary, that a use of formal analytical framework is helpful in a judicious exercise of judgment and in pinpointing areas of creative thinking. The case study of Praja Bank supports this statement.||V. L. Mote,B. G. Shah

By the accepted canons, then, they are representatives of the people. Yet, considering their socio-economic characteristics, they are anything but 'representative' of their constituents. In fact, the higher the public office a professional politician occupies, the greater are his personal assets and resources. If we mean by 'the best' those who have the most of whatever society values, then certainly political professionals are among the very best of us. The gap between the political class and the citizenry is maintained, and may even grow progressively, under the protective cover of democratic rhetoric. Socio-economic resources, moreover, are the base from which political power may be acquired; and this in turn may facilitate acquisition of further socio-economic resources. But one needs to continue to ask: does it really matter if the political class is an 'overclass' and the masses an 'underclass'? Is political life adversely affected if political control vests in the more affluent among us? Does it matter more what this political class does with its power than what its composition looks like? Is 'political equality' a good in itself? Beyond universal suffrage and its calculus, then, lies the sacred but messy question of government by representation. It is this issue especially that is likely to occupy prominence in the years ahead; for, this is the one problem which - in practice - remains unresolved everywhere there is organised State power. There are limitations, however, to the inferences we may draw from a socio-economic analysis of this issue, especially if it is largely confined to background data on a sector of the political class. Social background data can tell us, in a systematic manner, who constitutes the described sector and thus the originating point of inquiry. We would need much more information, based on entirely different kinds of data, to answer such questions as: what do they do with their positions? How do they do what in fact they do? Together, the 'who', 'what', and 'how', constitute the descriptive part of the analysis. The leap from this to an exploration of, why they enter the positions they occupy and behave the way they do, is of a qualitatively different order. It is at the terminal point of inquiry. Seen in this perspective, then, what follows may be considered a contribution to only a beginning - although a necessary one - in the exploration of the nature and functioning of our village political leaders. What we present is a partial profile of the background characteristics of political leadership at the village level. The data presented here are derived from a nationwide survey conducted under the auspices of the National Institute of Community Development in 1965. The survey covered 365 villages in 16 states of the Indian Union. From among these villages, 353 political leaders were interviewed; they constitute the sample on which this article is based.||Satish K. Arora
25/11/1972- ||review of management, november 1972||4362058||Management by Objectives: Some Implications||Over the years, Management by Objectives (MBO) has evolved into a total management approach and become a powerful tool for improving performance. The concept, in fact, is merely a logical extension of the normal management functions of planning, control, and motivation. However, while many managers may therefore think that they have always operated in this way, MBO requires organised rigour in planning and control processes. An important distinguishing feature of MBO is its emphasis on results rather than activities, on output rather than input. At the same time, as MBO followed the development of the behavioural approaches to management, it has also adopted many of the concepts of the behavioural sciences for practical application. This paper discusses some of the major implications of MBO. The author underlines that, although enthusiasm is a necessary element in the acceptance of ideas, only commitment of managers, based on a full understanding of what MBO can do for them and what they have to do to make it a success, can ensure qualitative acceptance and benefits from MBO.||B.

04/3/1972- ||special articles||4361102||Higher Education: To Set the House in Order||There has been too much emphasis in India on 'liberal education' at the university level and far too much has been invested in university education at the expense of school education. That more and more of higher education should be professions-oriented, and that admissions to different institutions should be correlated to projected manpower needs, has been proposed time and again by many educationists and has been put forth in some detail in the Education Commission Reports. What does not appear to have been adequately stressed, however, is that as a corollary to this, what is taught at the universities must also be professionally geared to create teaching and research cadres, and that admissions to universities must be regulated accordingly. The other 'professional' courses should not be given within the conventional universities but in separate technical colleges, and universities should be left to cater to 'academic' subjects. University graduates would thus be fit to be teachers and scholars, and candidates for any other profession would be more appropriately found among the professional-college graduates. A university so organised would offer several advantages. First and foremost, being a logically compact concept it would not suffer from internal contradictions such as the existing mismatch between what is taught and what the students need. It would thus have a unified purpose and direction. There will be no misgivings about courses of study being too 'bookish' and not sufficiently 'relevant'. And a university so organised and pruned could become relatively free of bureaucratic controls and procedures. In fact, even the other reforms, in examination and teaching methods, curricula, etc, are secondary, though extremely important, in that they cannot succeed in today's chaotic and confused university.||R.

Following this method in his study of ritual prestations, he stated that "We are dealing...with something more than... institutions divisible into legal, economic, religious and other parts. We are concerned with 'wholes', with systems in their entirety...It is only by considering them as wholes that we have been able to see their essence, their operation and their living aspect, and to catch the fleeting moment when the society and its members take emotional stock of themselves and their situation as regards others." In this paper the author has attempted to identify the South Indian village-level festival as one of those "fleeting moments" of social life to which Mauss referred, moments during which the total social structure is confronted by its members. In particular, the procession of the deity through the village is such an event.

1/8/1972- ||issues in education||4361674||Financing of School Education: Progress and Problems||An attempt is made in this article to review the progress of expenditure on school education and the trends in contributions from private and public sources of finance. The discussion focuses on the variations in cost per pupil in different types and stages of school education, the place of educational expenditure in budgetary allocations of Central and state governments, the growth in teacher salaries, the estimated burden of private non-tuition costs, and the role of private enterprises in school education. The review makes it evident that, in future, education will have to compete more for resource allocations with other developmental sectors such as health, irrigation, power, etc, both at the Central and the state levels. Moreover, within the educational sector, school education will have to compete more with higher education. The share of school expenditure in total educational finance is already showing a declining trend. The scope for private finance for schools, as seen here, is also very limited. Therefore, future growth in school education will depend on successful experimentation with ways and means to reduce costs by introducing better management techniques, on exploration of possibilities for public support, and on education being made more development and growth oriented.||H.

In estimating this magnitude, this paper examines the inter-sectoral and inter-class inequity in the incidence of tax on farm and non-farm households by estimating the patterns of income distribution in the farm and non-farm sectors and juxtaposing the same against the absolute levels of tax burdens on households under the respective income brackets. The estimates of inter-class incidence of taxation thus arrived at for the farm and non-farm households give rise to the question: If the existing tax incidence levels for non-farm households at different income brackets were superimposed on the corresponding income brackets of farm households, by the criterion of inter-sectoral equity, what is the quantum of additional potential tax revenue obtainable from the farm sector? The purpose here is not to suggest that the two sectors should have identical systems of taxation with identical rates schedules. The purpose is rather to indicate that any equitable system of taxation, devised for the farm and non-farm sectors under the existing patterns of income-distribution, entails that the proportion of income paid as tax should be equal in the comparable income groups of the two sectors. The study reveals that the lack of any significant big incomes, scope for sub-dividing land property which is the source of income, pressure of population and workers, and the general scope for under-reporting of income, would considerably reduce the effectiveness of a progressive direct tax system for the farm sector. Consequently, while a progressive direct tax system is applicable to the farm sector, it would not be sufficiently productive of revenue from the point of view of mobilising resources for economic development. On the other hand, the untapped indirect tax potential works out to a significant percentage of the total tax burden on the farm sector. The differences in the indirect tax burdens as between the farm and non-farm sectors, however, result from the fact that a much lower proportion of the consumption expenditure of farm households is on manufactured goods than that of non-farm households. Given the structure of indirect taxes, larger revenue yields from the farm sector are possible only if there is greater monetisation and relatively greater purchases of manufactured goods by the farm sector. It may also be possible to bring within the indirect tax net, some of the agricultural inputs and even the farm households-oriented consumption goods with a view to increasing the overall burden of indirect taxation on the farm households. [This study is an abridged version of Chapter 6 in the author's doctoral dissertation "Tax Burden on Farm and Non-Farm Sectors in India (An Inter-Sectoral and Inter-Class Analysis in India)", submitted to the University of Bombay in 1970. The author is grateful to the late H C Malkani, E T Mathew, C H Shah, and V M Jakhade for their comments and encouragement at various stages of the study.]||S. L. Shetty

30/9/1972- ||special article||4361885||Extent of Hunger in India||Approximately one-fourth of India's people are living in hunger, even on the minimum estimates of the amount of physical work done. While considerable poverty can be seen in the cities, the greatest amount of real poverty is probably in the rural areas, where it is not seen, except by a few. While many small farmers are in distress, the greatest aggregation of poverty appears, from many indications, to be among the landless rural wage workers and their families, who constitute a large proportion of the whole population. Many of these belong to the depressed castes. What can be done to relieve poverty on this massive and dreadful scale? The first step should be to enact a minimum wage. Such legislation however would remain a dead letter unless the rural workers are encouraged and assisted to form strong trade unions, which would prosecute offending employers. The other principal requirement is that the government should firmly follow a cheap food policy, and put up unqualified resistance to the requests for "support prices" for farm products, as agricultural productivity improves, and the exceptionally high prices of recent years begin to fall. It is always the poorest who have most to gain from cheap food.||Colin Clark

The approach must base itself also on such premises about behaviour, for instance the maximising motive, which themselves reflect the material reality. Unhistorical and/or non-materialistic approaches would fail to discern the distinguishing characteristics of monopolistic behaviour in Indian industry. Such a study will thus attempt to emphasise (a) monopoly capital, the highest form of capital in Indian industry today and (b) the business group, the most representative unit of monopoly capital. The study will be incomplete if it is not undertaken in relation to the distinguishing characteristics of the Indian economy today. These characteristics are principally three. First, India remains an underdeveloped economy basically still in the process of growth. Secondly, the role of the State is significant, in terms of both direct State ownership of the means of production and use of State economic policies for promoting and regulating private economic activity. Thirdly, foreign capital is significant in India, quantitatively and qualitatively, and indigenous monopoly is itself linked with it. All these characteristics require to be appropriately accounted for in a theory of behaviour of Indian monopoly. This is the task of a larger study of which this paper forms only an initial part.

The final outcome of the passionate controversy on the subject was not as 'instant' as it appeared at one time, but on July 22 the battle was over and the first phase of the new ceiling round - the principal national guidelines of a land ceilings programme - was ushered in. What has emerged has been shaped by compromise of views of the Central Land Reforms Committee, the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the nine-member panel appointed by the Congress, the Congress Working Committee and the Conference of State Chief Ministers. It is the purpose of this article to examine the ABCs of the programme's broad outline, to assess them as they might affect the course of the application of the ceilings, to comment on the role of the political forces which could spell success or failure of the enterprise and to conclude that, in the circumstances described, the net results of the complete absorption in land ceilings will be limited.

08/1/1972- ||special articles||4360929||The Reserved Constituency: Candidates and Consequences||Proceeding from the premise that inequalities in contemporary India are far greater than defensible, this paper assesses the Reserved Constituency for the Scheduled Castes as a mechanism for abridging these inequalities. The argument is based on field data from a Punjabi industrial town and concerns political processes in the sixties. Due to the large package of measures of reverse discrimination favouring Harijans and the spectacular endogenic industrial growth in the town which has drawn Harijans into the roles of skilled machine worker and entrepreneur, inequalities based directly on caste are on the wane. However, wealth and power continue to be highly concentrated in high caste hands. The town's Harijan political leaders tend to trade their political base for personal gains. None among them understands the larger institutional mechanisms which underlie and renew the current inequalities, nor do any have the stamina for applying themselves to the tasks of changing the larger system so that its processes would generate effective social, economic, and political equality.||Satish Saberwal

It is part of a larger comparative study of communalism and economic and political development in Asia. The broad hypothesis of the comparative study is that economic compulsions generate communal conflict in Asia, and that the religious, cultural and/or ideological idiom, in which the conflicts are sustained, is a mere expression of the more basic economic cleavages. The economic compulsions behind the conflict in Asia were inherent in the community-wise distribution of economic position since pre-British days. British capitalism undermined the economic position of the communities that were at the helm of the pre-British feudal systems. Thus the Malays in Malaysia, the Sinhalese in Ceylon, and the Muslims in India, are examples of communities that held the reins of power. The economic sustenance of at least their upper middle classes was derived from their inherited right and skill in governance. The subsequent system changes in the economy and the emergence of ballot-box politics threaten the privileged position of such elite groups. If they can protect their interests by identifying with the interests of a recognisable community, and to the extent that economic divisions are co-terminous with communal divisions, communal conflict is inevitable. Political dialogue, between leaders of the community in political power under the feudal system and leaders of the communities that appear to have surfaced from the currents of the new system, becomes difficult - unless the dialogue is kept open via authoritarian methods. At times, the dialogue is closed, as happened in the Partition of this subcontinent or the expulsion of Singapore from Malaysia. In this paper, the author attempts an illustration of how the leads and lags of Hindus and Muslims in entering the modern economic age have completely reversed the bargaining strength of one community vis-a-vis the other. [The author has benefited in this paper from several discussions with A M Khusro. Critical comments on an earlier draft of this paper given by T N Madan were also very helpful. The author is grateful to Shernavaz Billimoria for her continuous help in the tabulation of the data on this project.]||Ratna Dutta

30/9/1972- ||special article||4361886||Underground Railway for Bombay||We seem to be drifting unawares into a decision to provide an underground railway system for Bombay. There is a perceptible gathering of momentum of work on the project, which may soon carry it beyond a point of no return. Before that happens, and while there is still time, it may be relevant to debate the merits of the proposal. As things are, there is no single agency which can take a comprehensive view of the entire problem, see the interrelationships between development proposals and consequent travel demands, and work out the best strategy to minimise investment and to obtain the best value for money spent. The Metropolitan Transport Project of the Railways has altogether ignored any possible changes in development policies and programmes in framing its proposals for the transit systems of Bombay. What is needed is a state authority with capital budgeting powers which can allocate resources between different kinds of development and allocate also to different transport systems. This could lead to an integrated approach, but it is probably too much to hope that such a step would be taken in the near future. Instead, as an immediate measure, it might be possible to persuade the Planning Commission to take a closer look at the development of Greater Bombay and the proposals for meeting the consequent transport demand, examine the interrelationships, and in view of these advise the state government on the suitability of its various development programmes.||S.

To appreciate the limitations to which these expectations are subject, this article reviews, first, the history of the central organisations of Indian workers and, then, the experience of the recent moves for trade union unity.||S.

The purpose is to discover whether there is a 'regional effect' on the growth of manufacturing industries-if other variables such as industry and size are controlled. Regional differences in the profitability and growth records of manufacturing units are thus studied. The two regions compared in the paper are Maharashtra and Gujarat. The analysis is on the basis of the performance record of a sample of quoted companies, selected from the two states on a random basis, and studied in a comparative cost framework. It is seen that there are no significant differences between the averages of return to capital and the differences in the average rates of growth of companies between the two regions. But there are regional differences in their performance, to the extent that, individual industries have been more profitable in one region than in the other. There is thus evidence to suggest 'relative regional effect' for industrial growth.||K. K. Subrahmanian,T. S. Papola

The problem of transition consists of the contradiction between the peasants' attachment to their land and the State's need to put land under State ownership. Thus, while the State cannot at its will socialise agriculture, continuous development of a socialist economy is not possible without it. The physical problem of the transition concerns the accumulation of funds for investment. In any country with a large agricultural sector and a small industrial sector the investible surplus has to come initially mainly from agriculture. Faced with this problem of transition, the Polish agricultural policy has aimed to get accelerated growth of farm output together with socal transformation in the countryside with a socialist orientation. Against the background of Poland's historical experience and the nature of its agricultural sector this does not yet imply socialisation of all agriculture. In fact, Poland's agricultural sector is unique among socialist countries in that individual peasant farms account for 85 per cent of agricultural land, and small individual farms of 5-10 hectares constitute the largest group among individual farms. While the approach to agriculture in socialist countries has been of two types, viz, (i) to make use of the exchange relations with agriculture by the State, i e, through commercialisation through material incentives such as prices and (ii) to socialise agriculture by co-operative, collective or State farms. Both approaches have been tried in these countries at one time or another, or simultaneously. This paper reviews the evolution of the Polish agricultural system in this framework in terms of the following phases: 1945-48-the period of land reform; 1949-53 - the period of collectivisation that did not succeed; 1956-70-the new more flexible agricultural policy aimed at maximising growth while taking the country over time towards socialist transformation; and 1971-75-an adjustment and extension of the new agricultural policy. Poland has not yet found a New Model for the process of socialisation of agriculture through all its stages, but seems to have by now formulated a framework that might eventually reconcile the two opposing pulls of the transitional period.

With acreage as the measure of economic size, i e, of the scale of production, we obtain one set of results; with an alternative index of the scale of production, we may obtain diametrically opposite results. Further, in a situation of changing techniques, as at present, the grouping of farm data by acreage is likely to obscure some very important features of the dynamics of agricultural change. We propose to illustrate the argument with data on farm economics collected by us as part of a study of the growth of capitalist farming from 66 large farms scattered over 10 districts in 5 states in 1969.

As such, their structure and rates need to be devised in such a way as to be consistent with the major policy objectives of the government. With the reforms in these three taxes suggested here, government revenue is likely to increase. More important, however, even if the tax revenue did not increase, there would be an increase in the real resources of the economy and reduction in consumption disparities.||V. V. Bhatt

However, while labourers and their organisations have attracted wide attention, employers and their activities have failed to attract similar attention both from scholars and laity alike.

16/9/1972- ||special articles||4361820||Banking Commission on Costs||Ambiguity in the business objectives of banking is a source of conflict for public sector bank managers. The Banking Commission Report does little to clear this ambiguity. The question that assumes importance is: Are banks primarily public service bodies or are they primarily commercial institutions for public purposes. The answer to the question will determine the business objectives of banks, especially whether in their pricing policies the charges fixed for services should at all reflect marginal costs. This will also determine the efficiency of banks. However, there is growing evidence that banks can produce more 'output' with a given 'means of production' at its disposal. It is necessary in this context to have functional cost analyses with three principal objectives: first, to provide an itemised list of various current income and expenditure items as they relate to the major banking functions; second, to provide comparative figures for other banks as an aid in the analysis of an individual bank's or branch's performance; third, to provide a basis for pricing of their services.||Kalyan Banerji

08/4/1972- ||special articles||4361228||Caste and Status in an Indian City||Caste, in traditional India, implied a certain kind of value judgment: power was to be respected only when it was shown in its proper relation to religious duty. This judgment was clear even when the boundaries and rank of groups were not clear. It was still possible to say: 'Status means caste rank; this is the only thing that confers a moral claim to respect, and any kind of status that is valued must be turned into and called caste'. This is no longer so. But people continue to use the same moral vocabulary in making judgments about status. In this article are examined the kind of status judgments that are made in modern India - specifically, in a village which has become a part of an industrial city - to show that, while people use the same words, they often mean something quite different by them, and that the key to what they mean lies in changes in ideology. It is not hard to see why people in an expanding industrial economy should have changed their ideas like this. The author maintains that it is not economic determinism, however, to say that their situation gave them reason to think one thing rather than another; it is simply that in revising their social categories - which is what social change means - people take circumstances into account. People also take ideas into account directly - ideas they get from parties or sects or reading or travel or contacts.

There is, on the one hand, the modernisation model which seeks to undermine the autonomy and power of the new states. There is, on the other hand, what may be called the state-building model which seeks to conceive of the tasks of modernisation, economic development and the rest as part of a general drive towards consolidating national autonomy and realising the values of democracy, social justice and secularism. Bangladesh has come to life when the alternative scenarios can be perceived in their fullness, when the ground for making critical choices has been cleared of a lot of confusion and misleading cliche, and when the real need is for a proper perspective and bold initiatives from the political elite rather than passing on the responsibility to foreign trained technocrats.||Rajni Kothari

An anti-poverty programme via 'growth' (as suggested in the Central Planning Commission's 'Towards an Approach to the Fifth Five-Year Plan' and the Tamil Nadu Planning Commission's 'Draft Perspective Plan Frame') is self-defeating because unspecified 'growth' in a system where the vast majority are poor and a few are rich and where the process of valuation is based on economic strength, can only be to the advantage of the rich. It is argued in this note that the chief concern of an anti-poverty plan must be to spell out a pattern of production to achieve the objective rather than an undue obsession with 'growth' in the abstract (and its usual determinants, 'national income', 'savings' and 'investment', all of which make sense only with specification of the valuation process). It is pointed out too that a precondition for any such plan is a drastic reduction in the concentration of the ownership and control of the physical resources of the economy.||C. T. Kurien

Lack of adequate empirical data made it difficult to achieve the second objective. In our analysis of the Tariff Commission's Report and the OPPI Position Paper, it became evident that there was considerable difference of opinion between the two on what should be the 'adequate rate of return' and on methodology for its measurement. These differences are discussed in detail. One of the positive aspects of the Price Control Order is that it has once again brought into sharp focus the problem of maintaining profitability through higher sales at lower prices.

11/3/1972- ||special articles||4361126||The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: I: Early Concerns||In this, the first of a four-part historical narrative of the origins and growth of the RSS, the author deals with the disenchantment of many Congressmen with Gandhi's Non-Co-operation Movement and with efforts at Hindu-Muslim togetherness. One of these disaffected Congressmen, Hedgewar, whose early years are recounted in detail, goes on - inspired by Savarkar - to found the RSS in 1925. The emphasis in the early years of the RSS is on initiating unity, discipline and culture-consciousness among Hindus. By the late 1930s the RSS is an organised and trained group with its own para-military organisation. This attracts the attention of the Government of India which begins to keep a close watch on it. In order to prepare for the post-War period and the expected Hindu-Muslim troubles, the RSS decides at the beginning of the Second World War not to antagonise the Government in any way. Part of the strategy is to avoid scrupulously any political activity or any help to the Hindu Mahasabha. This decision proves to be controversial within the ranks of the RSS. The general approach of Golwalkar, Hedgewar's successor, is extreme caution in order to avoid the wrath of the British. The RSS does not take part in the 'Quit India' movement in 1942. The next part of this narrative deals mainly with the relationship between the RSS and the Hindu Mahasabha. The third section covers Gandhi's assassination and the subsequent banning of the RSS. The fourth and final part discusses the genesis of the Jan Sangh and the role played by the RSS in its formation.||Walter Andersen

They form either an expensive facade for a nation remaining stagnant and deprived or a de facto intermediary for and ally of continued foreign economic penetration and domination. At the same time, their inability to fulfil even the minimum needs of their peoples has given rise to a permanent state of confrontation between the rulers and the ruled. Often this confrontation erupts in senseless violence leading to wanton destruction of life and property of a particular tribe or group or a section of the leadership itself. General Amin's regime in Uganda represents the apotheosis of this type of rule. But Amin's regime is as different from President Nyerere's one-party democracy in Tanzania as, say, the British system is from Caetano's dictatorship in Portugal. Considering the wide variety of cultures, political systems, leaderships, ideologies and levels of socio-economic development which exist in Africa, no wider conclusions can or ought to be drawn from the appearance of a phenomenon like Amin. Considering these endless facets of the continent, it would indeed take the audacity of a dunce to make generalisations about Africa on the basis of a single event in a single country!||Anirudha Gupta

In today's world, divided as it is into developed and underdeveloped areas, neither can take place in an underdeveloped country unless the country is shielded from the developed countries. Underdeveloped countries have now to contend with the existence of developed countries whose political, economic, and social forces are always stronger than their own. Free competition, collaboration, and assistance will, in the circumstances, always work to the advantage of the developed countries and to the detriment of the developing ones. Not collaboration but enlightened isolation, is therefore the key to the underdeveloped countries' scientific and well as economic development. The concepts of internationalism of science and technology, of transfer of technology, of development through assistance and aid, have done immense harm and kept underdeveloped countries at the mercy of the developed ones. It is only with a policy such as this - of building science from the bottom up - and not by any mere organisational reform of the scientific activity alone in the country, can we unfetter the giant that is science today and use it for our economic and cultural progress.||K.

However, if its operations fail to materially alter the existing relationship between the multi-unit enterprise and the government, the holding company will simply become another level of supervision between the government and the individual units. Unless, therefore, the political and civil service wings of the government forgo certain functions and decision-making powers, the 'holding company' experiment is doomed to failure. This necessary precondition needs to be borne in mind while working out the detailed responsibilities and role of the holding company. In such an exercise, the experience, in the field, of countries such as Italy and Sweden could be usefully drawn upon. [The ideas expressed in this article do not represent the views of the government or the public enterprises, but are entirely those of the author.]||Ajit Singh

23/9/1972- ||special articles||4361854||Housing Policy: A Case of Subsidising the Rich?||Subsidised housing has been an important welfare programme in our Five-Year Plans. The state government housing boards have over time assumed a significant role in evolving and implementing the government's housing policies and programmes. This paper attempts an investigation of some aspects of the cost-benefit analysis of selected housing boards. The study relates primarily to the Gujarat State Housing Board, one of the most active and effective housing boards in the country. The results of the study seem to suggest that subsidies and windfall gains are larger for the more well-to-do among the income groups for whose benefit our housing schemes have been designed. The evidence that justifies this conclusion is as follows: (i) Within the low income group rental housing schemes, rates of subsidy are higher for the larger and more costly tenements. (ii) The government's effective rate of return on low-income (hire purchase) housing is somewhat larger than that on middle income housing. (iii) The gap between the government's return and the private return on hire purchase schemes is very larger and bestows substantial windfall gains on the middle income group. Such gains are much less substantial for the lower income group. It is thus imperative that the pricing policies in housing are examined in detail to see how and for whose benefit they have been formulated.||Samuel Paul

But, then, its tax policy observations and recommendations, which have attracted so much attention, were not germane to the Committee's principal tasks. The bulk of the Wanchoo Report concerns itself, quite appropriately, with legal and administrative measures designed to combat evasion and avoidance. And it is on the basis of its recommendations designed to improve the legal framework and administrative machinery that the Committee's work ought to be judged. Unfortunately, even on its homeground the Committee's observations and recommendations fail to inspire confidence.||I. S. Gulati
09/9/1972- ||special articles||4361795||Political Response to the 1966 Devaluation: II: Politicians and Parties||The devaluation of the rupee in 1966 came up against intense and widespread political reaction. This made it nearly impossible for the government to gain real political support for the measure ex-ante or to make a national appraisal of its success ex-post. An analysis of the factors underlying this outcome is, therefore, necessary to learn lessons for Indian policy-making so that some of the avoidable pitfalls can be eliminated the next time around; there are also more general lessons for policy-makers elsewhere too. In this paper, published in three parts, is examined the response to the devaluation of several elite groups: Congress Party and Opposition politicians in and outside Parliament, the Press, business and industrial groups, and economists. The argument developed in Part I of the paper, published last week, concerning the political response to the devaluation, is supported by detailed analysis of the relevant documents of the period. In this part is discussed the reaction of politicians and parties. In part III, to be published next week, the analysis will be extended to newspapers and magazines, industrial and business groups, and economists. [This paper was conceived jointly by Jagdish Bhagwati, K Sundaram and T N Srinivasan; it was designed to serve as an input into a study of the Indian devaluation experience which is to be included in a volume on India by J Bhagwati and T N Srinivasan, which is to be one of 10 country study volumes (on Brazil, Egypt, Chile, Philippines, South Korea, Colombia, Israel, Ghana, Turkey and India) being written under a project at the NBER, being jointly directed by Bhagwati and Krueger, on Exchange Control, Liberalisation and Economic Development. Part I was co-authored by all three authors; Parts II and III are authored by K Sundaram who was responsible for the bulk of the detailed analysis and examination of the relevant documents.]||K.

1/8/1972- ||issues in education||4361673||Development of Indian Higher Education||In the 25 years since Independence, higher education in the country has expanded rapidly but without developing adequately in line with the goals of planning. Enrolment in higher education has risen rapidly even as institutions of higher education have multiplied - resulting in overcrowding, worsening of the already unsatisfactory situation with regard to contact between teachers and students, and leading to restiveness among students. This article reviews the process of this linear growth and compares it with conditions of higher education as they exist in some of the other countries whose example may be relevant for India. It recommends deliberate curbing of the present expansionary process, selection of students for higher education strictly on merit, incorporation of a multiplicity of relevant professional courses including correspondence courses, and a reorientation of the university courses to remove the present accent on academic trivia and theory and underpin the academic curriculum with direct work and production experience. It is emphasised that illiteracy is a far more important target for educational planning than has been recognised or provided for till now. Provisions for education have to be much more guided by assessments of manpower requirements, and the content of education has to be much more determined by considerations of relevance and usefulness in the overall development of the country.||J.

27/5/1972- ||special articles||4361410||Studies in Planning Techniques: IV: Planning the Distribution of Income||One of the great concerns of Indian economic policy from the very beginning has been with reducing economic inequalities among the people, but little has been done to express this concern in a practical way through the techniques of planning. It is only recently, as more data on income distribution have become available and been subjected to a great deal of analysis, that we have become more aware of the problem and more concerned to make it an important objective of practical policy. There have already been a number of studies of the actual position and of various lines of policy which might be followed to deal with it. The present paper is an attempt to bring these together in a broad framework of policies as an aid to reconsider the techniques of planning for this purpose. The general conclusion to which this paper hopes to attract attention is that planning for equalisation must strike at the root causes of inequality and that the sources of inequality and the possibilities of reducing them are scattered all over the economy. These have to be identified more closely to estimate the equalising power of various specific policies. Once this is done, it will be possible to orchestrate them in various combinations so that what we gain in equalisation, we do not lose in development. For this purpose, it is also necessary to see the role of these policies in a time perspective. It is highly probable that drastic measures for equalisation may be self-defeating and damaging to growth prospects at the same time.||R. M. Sundrum

01/4/1972- ||special articles||4361197||The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: IV: Jan Sangh and Other Organisations||There is much evidence which suggests that the RSS leaders expected to influence politics in a Congress Party dominated by Vallabhbhai Patel. When the Congress Working Committee passed its resolution preventing RSS members from joining the Congress in late 1949 and when Patel acquiesced in this, the RSS did begin to look for some alternative way to influence politics. Those elements in the RSS who proposed more direct political involvement received a hearing within the organisation that would not have been possible before 1948. This was the backdrop to the formation of the Jan Sangh and the RSS's role in it. To extend the RSS's influence, a large number of other institutions were formed to spread the RSS ideology among various types of groups (i e, students, labour, teachers, etc). Rather than 'infiltrate' existing institutions, the RSS helped form separate groups. Because RSS members were excluded from many interest groups and political in the post-independence period, this option was, in a sense, forced on the RSS. [This is the fourth, and concluding, instalment of this study of the RSS. The first three parts discussed the origins and growth of the RSS, the relationship between the RSS and the Hindu Mahasabha and the ban on the RSS following Gandhi's assassination which led many in the RSS to conclude that the organisation would have to transform itself into a political party if the movement was to survive.]||Walter Andersen

From the distant reaches of optimal accumulation to the more mundane exercises of benefit-cost analysis, the additive social welfare function is a common basis for thinking and action. Benefits to different individuals (or groups) are added and the sum compared for selecting optimal plans or projects in theory, and something of that rubs off in practical decision taking as well. Is this indeed a good basis for systematic thinking on planning problems?||Amartya Sen
01/7/1972- ||special articles||4361547||On Differential Rates of Interest||A differential in rates of interest is justified on economic grounds. Since the banking system today enjoys a virtual monopoly of its service, and since a way can be found to prevent transfer of funds, discrimination between weaker customers and stronger customers is feasible within limits and is consistent with the principle of maximum profits. It is also in conformity with the social objective of favouring the poor as against the rich, insofar as the elasticity of demand or credit is higher in the case of the former than in the case of the latter. Since, further, the principle of maximum profit here relates to a monopoly, surrender of a part of such profits may also be permissible in respect of discrimination in favour of specially weak customers, so long as the rate charged does not fall below the marginal prime cost.||A.

10/6/1972- ||special articles||4361462||Seasonal Variations in Unemployment and Wage Rate: Implications for Rural::Works Programme||The main cause of the poverty in India is now recognised as the lack of adequate employment opportunities vis-a-vis the widespread underemployment and unemployment in the country. Since the Census and NSS data show only a small proportion of the population as 'unemployed', the cause of poverty is mainly underemployment. This paper attempts to measure the extent of rural underemployment between seasons by regions. To do this it uses variations in wage rate of agricultural and non-agricultural labour. Assuming plausible values of elasticities of demand and supply of labour, such variations in wage rate - between seasons and regions - are translated into variations in the extent of unemployment at a predetermined wage rate. This method of measuring unemployment or underemployment can help the policy-maker to estimate the wage bill, and hence the total cost of rural works, required to provide full employment at a predetermined wage rate. This approach, incidentally, may also provide the 'floor income' for all those who want to work at this predetermined wage rate - if the authorities can establish the wage rate through compensatory employment creation.

22/1/1972- ||special articles||4360982||Employment Strategy in Asia||The import-substitution strategy in economic development, followed by many developing countries in Asia, has been blamed by some economists for the slow growth of employment in them. It is argued that if market signals via the price mechanism are followed closely, the transition in these economies, from agriculture to labour-intensive industry and thence to a capital-intensive economy, would take place more easily. The experience of West Pakistan, Taiwan, South Korea and Japan is cited in support. However, this view of the 'successful' countries is an oversimplification of their growth process and ignores other factors that were largely responsible for their ostensible success. The basic objective of the liberalisation strategy is to permit a closer relationship between the market price of factors of production and their equilibrium level. The assumption is that there is an ideal equilibrium price which the market prices are unable to reach because of artificial barriers of government interference. The more fundamental question then is, why create these barriers? The justification for the controls, or 'barriers', is that price signals are based on existing factor endowments and current demand situation in the market. In a developing country, neither of these quite reflects the future potentialities or desired structure of the economy. The effective demand generates heavy pressure for comfort-oriented consumption goods and imports, while factor endowments favour production of traditional goods and exports. A 'liberal policy' may thus perpetuate the colonial pattern of economic activity, and the transition from a traditional to a modern economy may never take place. This, of course, is not to say that controls do not require close scrutiny. In fact, misuse of them might create the same signals, as under the liberal strategy, at a higher cost-level.

13/5/1972- ||special articles||4361363||Studies in Planning Techniques: II: The Development Strategy||In the first part of these studies, published last week, it was argued that the planning process would be greatly facilitated by the deliberate choice of a development strategy to indicate the broad directions in which it is proposed that the economy should move over a fairly long period. The present part is concerned with a definition of this concept in more detail. In particular, the strategy concept will be distinguished from the sort of perspective planning that is now carried on in India. The concept of development strategy cannot be laid down in terms of specific decisions, but it can be formulated in terms of decision-making rules, which can then be applied to make the actual decisions as new data become available. This approach will then help to ensure that a long-term point of view is taken into account in dealing with practical decisions, so that they are not overwhelmed by narrower short-term considerations. Only a few broad aspects of a development strategy have been discussed above to illustrate the contrast between the real issues and the numerical exercises we tend to indulge in. In particular, an attempt has been made to distinguish areas of planning where the optimum period of advance decision-making is long from those where it is short.||R. M. Sundrum

The short and successful completion of the liberation struggle and the establishment of a democratic government in Bangla Desh in the face of a sinister war machine backed by powerful states is only the last of a series of events. The long and epic battle of the people of Vietnam against the most powerful of the world's super powers, the success of the revolutionary movement in Cuba in the heart of the American empire, the survival and consolidation of independent nation-building in Yugoslavia in the face of the Stalinist straitjacket, the defeat of secession in Nigeria which was backed by powerful foreign countries, the democratic awakening in Chile, and the efforts of men like Nyerere to withstand external pressures on the new states of Africa and adopt an independent posture - all these underline an assertion of resurgent nationalism against the massive impact of supra-national forces in both political and economic-technological fields. The growth of Chinese power and self-reliance since the break with Russia and the initially ambivalent, but in the end definitive, assertion of political autonomy by India are also pointers in the same direction. These are achievements that have many lessons for the peoples of the Third World who, with important exceptions, have been dominated by a model of development that has, in one continent after another, undermined national independence in the name of economic development, frustrated all attempts at improving the conditions of life of ordinary people in spite of record GNPs and rates of growth, and suppressed democratic regimes through the growth of militarism and fascism. What follows is a critical evaluation of the existing model of development - and a possible alternative to it - from the point of view of realising the values of national autonomy, political freedom and economic justice for the peoples of the Third World.||Rajni Kothari

Such a regime is almost always a precursor to revolution or counter-revolution. What is missing in Chile is a mass revolutionary socialist party capable of leading the masses into revolutionary action and resolving the crisis in their favour. The revolutionary left consisting of the left-wing of the socialist party, the Revolutionary Communist Party (pro-Peking) and the largest of the three the MIR taken together constitutes a small force yet. With the assumption of office by Salvador Allende the electoral path has reached its final culmination, and looking at the Allende government's two-year record, a dead-end. If Allende moves towards a more radical stance (which seems unlikely) there will be a definite shift to the violent path, including the danger of intervention by the military. If he moves further on the road to compromise with the bourgeoisie (which is more likely), then it will have been proved once again that socialism cannot be won peacefully.||Lajpat Rai

Its link with welfare economics, based on the concept of Pareto-optimality, has no foundation in reality or in any acceptable notion of rational ethics. A world of monopolies and oligopolies, mergers and cartels, and gians industrial complexes does not approximate by any stretch of imagination to the neo-classical competitive mechanism resulting in a Pareto-optimal state of the economy. On the other hand, if Pareto-optimality is to be brought about by centralised or decentralised controls, then the basic issue is: What is the sanctity of the concept of Pareto-optimality which is based on the fundamental postulate that individual preferences are to count? In an economy where production relations are either capitalistic or feudalistic or a combination of the two, the leverage given to the richer sections of the society conflicts with any notion of ethical propriety.||Ajit K.

1/2/1972- ||state-building: a case||4361004||Social Background of Bangla Desh||Aryanisation did not come to Bengal till as late as in the fifth century AD. Even then, the people of Bengal went under the Brahminical way of life because of the accompanying economic domination and privileges. The Hindus of Bengal, however, stayed consolidated by their Bengali affiliation and were correspondingly alienated from the Hindus in the rest of India. The bulk of East Bengal, which was riverine, was not easily accessible from the west and it remained distinct in its creeds and cults. Consequently, when in the wake of Muslim conquest the zeal for conversion to Islam was felt in Bengali society, the people of East Bengal were converted in great majority. The regional distinction thus coincided with the religious differentiation. The Bengali forces of consolidation were nevertheless greater than the forces of alienation. In fact, with the onset of the Bhakti movement in eastern India, Hindus and Muslims were brought closer to each other on the social and ideological planes. The Bengali ethnic unity, which thus emerged, was on the point of attaining nationhood in the 16th-18th centuries. But at this time, the economy of Bengal suffered a serious reversal in the first phase of British rule which affected the Muslims more adversely than the Hindus. The Muslims, as erstwhile rulers, were deliberately discriminated against in the field of administration and civil organisation as well as in the economic activities pertaining to the interest of the Company. The middle class which developed in Bengal by the end of the 19th century was, therefore, composed almost entirely of Hindus. This affected the previously established harmony in Bengal's social structure and the conflict was felt more keenly in East Bengal because of its Muslim majority. The situation was worsened by the resurgence of government-supported religious orthodoxy in both communities from the last quarter of the 18th century. Even so, the identity of 'Bengali' held ground. In 1905, such a powerful movement developed against the British proposal to divide Bengal administratively into East and West, that the proposal had to be hastily withdrawn. The Hindu middle class, however, continued to be solidly entrenched in Bengal's economy and in the circumstances the Bengali Muslims saw a way out by responding to the call of the All-India Muslim League. When East Bengal came into being, it appeared that the Bengali Muslim interests would have free and full play. In fact, they secured easy access only to the lower and middle rungs of economic activities, while the top positions in government and commerce and industry became the virtual monopoly of the West Pakistanis. With the rapid spread of education in subsequent years, those who had previously filled the vacancies at the middle rungs began to feel frustrated at the lack of opportunity to improve their positions further. A social force thus began to gather momentum among Bengali Muslims to push away the obstruction to the very development that had inspired them earlier to subscribe to the ideology of Pakistan viz, to possess a territory and government of their own and to control their own market in goods and services. The old leaders of the Bengali middle class became active once again. The State power retaliated with alternate measures of repression and concession and in the process merely fed the ever-growing national upsurge of the East Bengalis, who finally and categorically ceased to identify themselves as Pakistanis.

25/3/1972- ||review of agriculture, march 1972||4361170||Planning and Implementation of Financing the Area Development Scheme||The area approach in agricultural financing was adopted by the commercial banks to overcome their lack of an infrastructure in the rural areas by concentrating on definite regions. At the same time, to develop the necessary expertise and to pool the necessary financial resources for agricultural financing, the banks sponsored the Agricultural Finance Corporation in 1968. As part of the area approach, the AFC formulated a number of specific schemes to be financed by member banks. One of these was the Minor Irrigation Scheme of the Bihar Relief Committee (BRC). This scheme was an extension of BRC's drought relief work of 1966-67. This article describes the aims and outlines of the scheme, how the AFC put through the project report to the banks and planned the implementation of the financing, and how the scheme actually progressed. In the event, the achievements fell far short of the targets - in terms of the number of wells that materialised, the sanctioning and disbursement of funds, and the time taken by the procedures prior to actual construction. An examination of various case studies traces the failure of the scheme to the marketing of the idea and the demand creation for wells. The article concludes that the major lesson to be learned from this experience of planning and implementation of financing an area development scheme is that it is necessary to obtain proper knowledge of the problems of demand, the administrative bottlenecks of land titles and encumbrance certificates, and the farmer's motivation and attitudes towards risk-taking at the micro-level. Efforts to develop the infrastructure first and then to begin to understand the problems of the micro units in the area become a costly affair.||D. K. Desai,Hari Prakash

This made it nearly impossible for the government to gain real political support for the measure ex-ante or a rational appraisal of its success ex-post. An analysis of the factors underlying this outcome is, therefore, necessary to learn lessons for Indian policy-making so that some of the avoidable pitfalls can be eliminated the next time around; there are also more general lessons for policy-makers elsewhere too. In this paper, to be published in three parts, is examined the response to the devaluation of several elite groups: Congress Party and Opposition politicians in and outside Parliament, the Press, business and industrial groups, and economists. The arguments developed in Part I of the paper, concerning the political response to the devaluation, is supported by detailed analysis of the relevant documents of the period. In Part II, is discussed the reaction of politicians and parties. In Part III the analysis will be extended to newspapers and magazines, industrial and business groups, and economists.||Jagdish Bhagwati,K. Sundaram,T. N. Srinivasan

Yet studies on the green revolution have shown that it has been limited to the few who have the resources or the access to institutional finance. The problem of credit to small farmers is mostly a problem of short-term finance in irrigated-areas while it is more a problem of long-term finance in the dry-areas where the needed infrastructure has not been made available through public investments. Even in areas newly brought under irrigation through public investments, small farmers need long-term finance for levelling, bunding, terracing, soil conservation, etc. Most Committees, with the exception of the Rural Credit Review Committee of 1969, however, concentrated their attention upon short-term and medium-term credit and neglected the issue of long-term finance especially in relation to the small farmer. Against this background, an attempt is made in this paper to evaluate the scanty published data on long-term finance in relation to the small farmers. The analysis is mainly limited to the advances of land development banks for 1969-70. Available data are examined to seek answers to the following questions. (1) What is the percentage of small farmer-households that borrowed from land development banks vis-a-vis others? (2) What is the proportion of small farmers to the total borrowers from land development banks? (3) Is there any relationship between the area owned by small farmers and the advances made to them? (4) What is the relative share of small farmers in the total advances? [The authors are grateful to B Prasada Rao for his valuable suggestions.]||R. M. Mohana Rao,P. Jagannadha Acharlu

This policy conclusion and the underlying analysis can perhaps be traced to a failure to identify the most economical sources of the various nutrients. On the other hand, if we look for relatively inexpensive foods, a balanced diet will not remain beyond the means of everyone. This exercise makes such an attempt and the results bear out the above argument. It is seen that a balanced diet can be obtained at a cost of 62.4 paise per day for an adult male. Notwithstanding the limitations of the model, it indicates clearly that a diet which provides sufficient levels of essential nutrients and reasonable palatability is within the reach of most people even in Kerala which has been identified as the state with the highest proportion of under-nourished people. If the analysis is correct, then the planning Commission's limited, if not negative, approach to India's nutrition problem is unwarranted. The foregoing analysis does not, however, imply that there is no undernutrition or malnutrition in Kerala. On the contrary, there is great scope for quantitative and qualitative improvement in the diet of the people of the state.

1/8/1972- ||industrial choices||4361670||New Strategy for India's Steel Development||India's steel development efforts need to be tuned to the larger national objectives of raising the living standards of its expanding population. Viewed in the context of the 'garibi hatao' programme, India may need an annual capacity of 100 million tons of steel by the end of the century. This target is not only realistic but well within India's capabilities. India's past performance in steel development is quite encouraging when it is realised that the country added to steel capacity at the rate of one million tons per annum in the five years 1955-60. India is today placed in more propitious circumstances. The country has the experience of constructing and operating five large steel plants with one more under construction. As the full potential of the machinery and equipment building units gets mobilised and new equipment manufacturing capacity is created, India should be able to add 2 to 3 million tons per year of steel capacity in the following decade (1981-90) and 4 to 5 million tons per year thereafter. However, the new capacity in steel cannot be entirely realised from the expansion of existing units - though this would considerably reduce the capital cost and be comparatively less time consuming. The expansion would be necessarily limited by technological and other considerations. Similarly, the impact of mini steel plants which serve a useful purpose in meeting local demand, will only be marginal because of their small size. There can thus be no alternative to the construction of entirely new large capacity steelworks.||M. N. Dastur

06/5/1972- ||special articles||4361337||Studies in Planning Techniques: I: The Planning Horizon||A number of circumstances make this an opportune time to reconsider some aspects of Indian planning techniques. The planning techniques which have been perfected upto now have many achievements to their credit in the past twenty years, but past experience also reveals some directions in which they can be improved. The need for such improvements has also become more urgent at this time, when there are too many ominous signs of the pace of development slowing down, while expectations continue to rise. This is partly because some of the factors which helped the planning process in the past are no longer fully operative. A basic reconsideration will also be useful as the renovated Planning Commission takes a look at its future tasks, in which the objectives of economic development have taken on new dimensions of concern with its social aspects. This series of four studies by the author is concerned with some issues of the techniques of planning, i e, with questions, not so much of what decisions are made in the context of planning, but of how these decisions are made, and with some of the ways in which this decision-making process can be improved in future. The subject of these studies, therefore, overlaps considerably with the question of the machinery of planning, as considered by the Administrative Reforms Commission and its Study Team. This, the first of the four studies, discusses the problem of the planning horizon. Indian planning techniques have so far been dominated by the Five-Year Plan approach. In making plan decisions over as long a period as five years at a time, Indian planning has made a very great advance. But this has been achieved at some cost. There has been a tendency to determine the details of individual projects to suit the financial allocations rather than the other way about. Thus, while there has always been a great deal of discussion of physical targets, Indian planning has often failed to bring the financial targets and the physical targets together. At the financial level, the planning effort has served the country well upto a point. In spite of the lack of correspondence between financial targets and physical outcomes, financial planning has guided the economic evolution of the country in a direction roughly corresponding to the overall design of development. But the time has come to build further on this achievement and give greater emphasis to the underlying economic aspects of planning. For this purpose, some modification of the Five-Year Plan approach is necessary. This paper suggests an alternative model of the planning process. In this model various developmental activities are classified into three categories consisting of (i) those in which the optimum period of advance decision-making is particularly long, say, one or two decades; (ii) those requiring a medium period of advance decision-making of, say, five years; and (iii) those where very little advance decision-making can be done and, therefore, have to be covered by annual plans. The other three studies in this series will deal, respectively, with the 'development strategy', 'decentralisation of planning' and 'planning the distribution of income'.||R. M. Sundrum

In the process of this study, we encountered several methodological problems which are discussed at the beginning in some detail. While the methodological observations have, strictly speaking, only this village study as their domain, they might be of more general interest. Also analysed are the prospects with which the so-called Green Revolution confronts the different sections of the peasantry. We have consciously chosen a wide canvas so as to be able to sketch out, albeit tentatively, the aggregate framework within which alone, in our opinion, a meaningful village study can be conducted. Organised within a Marxian frame, both the factual content and the inferences of this study have been derived from investigations conducted by the authors at the village. This paper, which is a sequel to an earlier paper ("Economic Decision-Making of the Poor Peasant Household", Annual Number, Feburary 1972) on the economic decision-making of the poor peasant household, forms part of a study conducted at the Agricultural Economics Research Centre, Delhi.

That is, reduction of labour input per unit of output - or reduction of the percentage of the labour-input in the total input structure - is likely to be accompanied by more intensive employment of labour in multiple cropping made possible by the short-period-maturity HYV, and result in a more valuable composition of farm products. Facilities for obtaining mechanical services on custom basis are likely to lower the charges of farming operations compared to those carried out by human and animal labour. This would further widen the scope for diversification of farm enterprises, and the saved labour could become a factor of growth. If land-ceilings are rigidly enforced, so that holding sizes become small and standardised, the consequent increase in self-employment would reduce the wage-labour market. But inadequacy of timely labour in many urgent farming operations might still make itself felt. In such a situation, farmers could form co-operatives for supplying themselves with mechanical aid which would otherwise be beyond their reach.

It is only natural that Bangladesh, emerging from its subservience to the economy of West Pakistan, will seek to develop its own economy on an independent basis. Not being endowed with a variety of natural resources adequate for its needs, Bangladesh will have to depend on a skilful development of its foreign trade to make up for this fact. In this respect, the situation of Bangladesh compares with that of Japan. However, Bangladesh's proximity to India may be advantageous to it. It can be shown that the objective of viability of Bangladesh's economy could be pursued with benefit to both countries.||Deb Kumar Bose,Anil Chatterjee

These firms greatly depend on imported technology and imported raw materials for production. As a whole, the pharmaceutical industry in India is far less productive than it is in other countries - judged by the investment to production ratio. The majority of the products are 10 years, or more, old and the technology cannot be termed 'advanced' by Western standards. The visible and invisible costs borne by the nation for the foreign capital and technology have been heavy. How far the pharmaceutical industry, given its present set-up, would be able to attain the national objective of self-sufficiency in drugs calls for a thorough study of the industry's technology, modifications of processes and efforts towards subsitution of imported raw materials. Measured by the present trends in R and D investments, the industry is not geared to any major innovation in the near future.||P. K. Ramachandran,B. V. Rangarao

Those responsible for these grim prognostications have, however, not sufficiently considered several important factors relevant to the problem. This paper presents an analysis of the foodgrain situation in Bangla Desh and provides an explanation of why no famine has occurred there so far. It also presents a perspective for 1972 and more particularly for the first half of the year. In addition to making use of published and unpublished statistics emanating from various official and non-official sources, and the work of many authors, this paper has drawn upon information about the foodgrain situation and crop prospects in various parts of Bangla Desh collected through interview of thousands of refugees from Bangla Desh at various entry points in India.||Swadesh R.

This made it nearly impossible for the government to gain real political support for the measure ex-ante or to make a national appraisal of its success ex-post. An analysis of the factors underlying this outcome is, therefore, necessary to learn lessons for Indian policy-making so that some of the avoidable pitfalls can be eliminated the next time around; there are also more general lessons for policy-makers elsewhere too. In this paper, published in three parts, is examined the response to the devaluation of several elite groups: Congress Party and Opposition politicians in and outside Parliament, the Press, business and industrial groups, and economists. The argument developed in Part I of the paper, concerning the political response to the devaluation, is supported by detailed analysis of the relevant documents of the period. In Part II, published last week, was discussed the reaction of politicians and parties. In this, the last part, the analysis is extended to newspapers and magazines, industrial and business groups, and economists. [This paper was conceived jointly by Jagdish Bhagwati, K Sundaram and T N Srinivasan; it was designed to serve as an input into a study of the Indian devaluation experience which is to be included in a volume on India by J Bhagwati and T N Srinivasan, which is to be one of 10 country study volumes (on Brazil, Egypt, Chile, Philippines, South Korea, Colombia Israel, Ghana, Turkey and India) being written under a project at the NBER, being jointly directed by Bhagwati and Krueger, on Exchange Control, Liberalisation and Economic Development. Part I was co-authored by all three authors; Parts II and III are authored by K Sundaram who was responsible for the bulk of the detailed analysis and examination of the relevant documents.]||K.

Anticipatory data are non-causal or pre-flow data, the best examples of which are investment intentions and orders for capital goods. They are 'non-causal' data, in the sense that they do not explain any phenomenon. They merely reflect the earlier phases in the investment decision-making process, which can give us some advance signals of the magnitude of the end result. While an analysis of orders for plant and equipment does not shed any light on the basic determinants of investments, it can serve the useful purpose of supplying a link in the prediction of plant and equipment expenditures. Once the time-lag between orders and deliveries is estimated, it should be possible for us to examine the variables that influence the placement of orders, such as expected profitability, degree of capacity utilisation, and availability of liquid funds. One could, thus, complete the chain from determinants of investment to plant and equipment expenditures, through the link of the order-delivery relationship.

This paper is concerned with the purely economic constraints on capacity utilisation. The Keynesian prescription for utilisation of excess capacity, viz, raising of aggregate demand, may not be applicable in a developing economy where the supply function may be inelastic. But to analytically incorporate this constraint for policy purposes, it is necessary to construct a disaggregated technology matrix of co-efficients. The greater the level of disaggregation, the more realistic would be the analysis. This paper undertakes an illustrative exercise, using a 30-sector Leontief technology matrix. Given estimates of excess capacity in each sector, an inter-industry table, the final demand vector necessary to utilise the capacity in each sector such that the technology constraint is satisfied, can be worked out. It can be shown that, with a given vector of excess capacity, if some final demands generated in the system turn out to be negative, the sectors in question will become supply bottlenecks to a programme of excess capacity utilisation. Once a programme of the final demand to be created for each industrial sector in order to utilise excess capacity in each sector is derived, the important questions are: likely implications for wage goods, particularly foodgrains, and for the foreign exchange balance, at given levels of export and import propensities.||Yoginder K.

Though he did not carry his analysis to any length, Kornai threw up some extremely suggestive pointers on the dichotomy between "feasible" plans and "admissible plans" which have been explored further in this paper. An attempt has been made here to concretise the problem area and to set the planning process in its relevant socio-political context. This is however an exploratory approach intended to demarcate the regions where further research is called for. A conceptual framework has been built up within which the inter-relationship of "feasibility" and "admissibility" is studied and a behavioural pattern sought to be established.

1/2/1972- ||state-building: a case||4361005||The Class Character of the Pakistani State||The Muslim League, the main political force behind the creation of Pakistan, was from its inception dominated by two classes: the zamindars from north-west India and the traders from western India. Even after the numerically dominant poor Muslim peasants from East Bengal rallied to the League, its organisation remained very firmly under the control of these two classes. The political impotence of East Pakistan in the governmental structure of Pakistan after it was formed was most obvious under Ayub, though even earlier the leaders from East Pakistan at the Centre wielded no effective political power. In fact both in the bureaucracy and the armed forces as well as in the sphere of economic development East Pakistan's share was insignificant. The role of the exploiting classes in East Pakistan - the new Muslim rural jotedars replacing Hindu landlords, and the urban upper middle classes and industrialists - in the overall governmental machinery of Pakistan resembled in many ways the role of the zamindars and other semi-feudal masters of British India; although exploiters themselves, their main task was to make foreign rule as safe and secure as possible. It would be erroneous, therefore, to consider the exploiters from East Pakistan as an integral and inalienable part of the ruling classes of Pakistan. Therefore, in this article, a detailed analysis is attempted of the West Pakistan productive system in both industry and agriculture, not neglecting the officer groups who have always been closely connected with the two ruling classes. An overall assessment of the character of the West Pakistan ruling classes is necessary to judge the class character of the Pakistani State. Here a number of points are striking. There has been no improvement during the last 20 years in the living conditions of the working masses either in villages or towns. Almost the entire increase in per capita GNP has benefited the upper income groups. Both in agriculture and industry, production has increased rapidly; private investment in both sectors has been substantial, landlords and monopoly capitalists being the main investors. Despite their very high resultant incomes, however, the savings rates of these two classes have been rather low. They have also received extraordinarily large subsidies in various ways from government. Even so, the volume of direct investment by the State is much greater than by the private sector. What is more, these magnitudes of investment in the private and public sectors would not have been possible but for the massive injection of foreign aid. Foreign private capital, too, has been greatly welcome and has captured sizeable parts of large-scale organised industry. Foreign capital also has other ties, written and unwritten, with local capitalists. While the West Pakistan capitalists cannot be fitted into the mould of typical comprador, they have never been like national bourgeoisie. Neither their present economic nor their present political power is born out of a struggle against imperialism. In fact, they seem for too dependent for their prosperity on the generosity of the imperialists. Still, it would be naive to preclude the possibility of a conflict between them and the international monopoly capital on which at the same time they depend. But Pakistani capital is still in its infancy, and may be crippled irretrievably with continuing massive aid. Hence at the present stage of development, it is closer to 'comprador' than 'national' capitalism. In the more populous countries of the Third World, these semi-comprador capitalists are undoubtedly the ablest and most dependable allies of imperialism in the modern neo-colonial era.||N. K. Chandra

25/3/1972- ||review of agriculture, march 1972||4361168||Growth and Imbalances in Indian Agriculture||Even with the bumper harvest of 1970-71 the growth rate of total foodgrain output at 2.9 per cent per annum since 1949-50 through 1970-71 is no higher than that, at 3 per cent per annum, realised during the period 1949-50 to 1964-65. And if the focus be extended to include cash crops, for which the growth rate for the respective periods shows a significant decline from 3.6 to 3 per cent per annum, the overall growth rate of agricultural output is seen to drop from 3.2 to 2.9 per cent per annum. This is giving rise to a major imbalance between the foodgrain and the non-foodgrain components of agricultural production. Adequacy of a rate of growth of agricultural output is a relative matter, related to the income-employment goals we set ourselves to achieve. Unless we set our sights so low as not to be able to make much dent on the problem of poverty except over a very long haul, the growth rate of foodgrain output over the next decade would need to be higher, at any rate not significantly lower, than 3.5 per cent per annum. The expenditure elasticities of demand for cash crops are around unity or above and so the growth of 3 per cent per annum in per capita expenditure would imply a growth rate of around 5.5 per cent per annum in the demand for cash crops. However, whereas the need is for achieving for cash crops a much higher growth rate of output than for foodgrains, what has been happening since the mid-sixties is exactly the reverse of it. While the growth rate for foodgrain output has been about maintained, that for cash crops has suffered a sharp contraction in recent years. It is therefore important to inquire into what lies behind this near-paralysis in the output of cash crops. Since the growth rate of productivity for cash crops seems to have been about maintained, the decline in the growth rate of output appears to be ascribable almost entirely to the loss of area these crops have suffered during recent years. Cash crops have lost acreage to foodgrains not only in a relative sense but also in the absolute. So long as a technological breakthrough does not occur in cash crops, the larger part of the step-up in the growth rate of their output will have to be achieved through expansion in their cropped acreage. Even if the growth rate of productivity for cash crops is stepped up to 2 per cent per annum, the entire addition made to the gross cropped area will need to be assigned to cash crops if their output is to be made to increase at around 5.5 per cent per annum. In other words, the entire burden of accelerating the growth rate of foodgrain output, nay even of maintaining it, will have to be borne by the growth rate of their per hectare productivity. So far, however, if foodgrain output has been able to maintain its growth rate, this it has done by throwing at least a part of its incidence on cash crops through a suction of their acreage. And this is because a real breakthrough in per hectare yields has so far been confined to wheat. While bajra and maize have maintained the growth rates of their per hectare yields, of rice and jowar even this cannot be said. In fact, the pull of the cereals in drawing area away from other crops has not been confined to cash crops; a good part of the incidence has fallen on the pulses. This has given rise to another imbalance - an imbalance between cereals and pulses within the foodgrain basket. Another imbalance introduced by the technological lag belongs within the cereals basket, crucially manifesting itself in the disparate performance of rice and wheat. Attention needs to be drawn also to the high degree of regional concentration which has characterised the increases in foodgrain output in recent years, over two-thirds of the increase in 1969-70 over the production in 1964-65 having been contributed by three states alone, Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Other states and regions have to be lifted up, most of all such pockets of concentrated poverty as, for example, eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Orissa.||Dharm Narain

22/7/1972- ||special articles||4361630||Indo-African Trade: A Re-Assessment||The present pattern of India's foreign trade underscores a heavy dependence upon both traditional goods and traditional markets. Yet there is a good case for reducing this dependence and diversifying both in terms of commodities and countries. There is, in fact, much scope for Indian exports to the developing countries of South-East Asia, West Asia, Africa and Latin America. This paper, therefore, studies the trend, need, and possibilities of trade between India and Africa. It is seen that little effort has been made by India so far to explore or tap the markets on the African continent even though such trade has significant growth potentials for both sides. India's trade with Africa has remained restricted to a few countries and a few, mostly traditional, items. A breakthrough to a broader base is called for on both these fronts.||Priya Mutalik-Desai
29/4/1972- ||special articles||4361307||Employment and Income in Rural India||The phenomena of low utilisation of labour, low earning, and inadequate consumption of the vast majority of the people in India have to be analysed in the context of the semi-feudal bondage in which a vast majority of the rural population live even today. It is the high concentration of land in the hands of a few, the uneconomic holdings of the small farmers, and the high proportion of landless labourers, that explain the low utilisation of land and labour - there being sufficient empirical evidence that large farmers use land less intensively than do the small farmers. In the circumstances, land reforms - rather than the present intensive agricultural development programmes - are strongly indicated for improving land and labour utilisation in the country and freeing people from semi-feudal bondage. Also necessary are widespread sources of supplementary income for the people. Labour-intensive techniques in non-basic goods production is a viable way of ensuring this. This article argues that the existing manufacturing set-up will not be capable of generating the supplementary income or of diverting the population from agriculture to industry with a view to reducing semi-feudal exploitation. The employment base of the presently patterned manufacturing sector is too low to have any significant impact in the near future.||Pradhan H. Prasad
30/9/1972- ||review of agriculture, september 1972||4361881||Land Transfers in Rural Communities: Some Findings in a Ryotwari Region||Distribution of land ownership and the forces shaping it over time are usually issues of major policy concern. Acute scarcity of land, a large subsistence sector, and other economic factors leading to an excessive value being put on land ownership per se, create anxieties that an unregulated land market may lead to increasing concentration of land in the hands of large owners. This would not only go against professed egalitarian objectives but might also raise other problems attendant to large-scale tenancy where the owners themselves shun cultivation. Land reform legislation in India has derived from such a conception of the situation. In spite of such concern with countering concentration of land-ownership, little attention has been given to the processes and factors that give rise to such concentration. Yet, it should be evident that analyses of these are important in the formulation of any measures to avoid the disadvantages of the phenomenon. This paper aims to present some findings on this issue from the Ryotwari areas of Maharashtra and Gujarat states which formed part of the composite Bombay state before bifurcation in 1960. Bombay state was a pioneer in the area of tenancy reforms. It is claimed that the distribution of land ownership in 1956 provides useful clues to the way the distribution has been changing in the area in the period prior to the legislation aimed at altering the distribution. Section II presents such a cross-section analysis. Section III relates to purchases and sales of land during 1956-65, analysed to indicate the types of cultivators transacting in the land market, the net transfers of land ownership brought about in the market, and some features of the actual functioning of the market.||V.

The full danger of relying on this limited range of 'dynamic exports' has not been realised. This note suggests that, whatever the long term potential of the 'dynamic' items, their immediate growth in the rest of the Fourth Plan will be disappointing and that overall export growth in the Fourth Plan will not exceed 5 per cent per annum. Even this growth rate is likely to be reached only as a result of the disruption of the Bangladesh jute industry, the effects of which will continue to be felt until late 1973.||Angus Hone,V. K.

The study seeks to (a) compare the growth of small towns with that of towns and cities of other sizes; and, (b) explain variations in the growth of small towns during 1951-61 in terms of (i) initial population of the town; (ii) economic structure of the town; (iii) location of the town; and (iv) influence of the nearest city centre. Of the factors considered, the initial population base and the economic structure of the town and of the nearest city were found to be of little importance. The locational factors, on the other hand, appeared to exert an important influence on the growth of small towns.||K. B. Suri

04/3/1972- ||special articles||4361101||Price Information Associated with Principal Distributions of National Income||For practical reasons, it may be desirable to separate the basic problem of valuation of national product from the problem of deflation. Since, in most countries, deflation is a more approximate process than basic valuation, it may be permissible to use a weaker price basis for deflation than for valuation. However, if the real change in national output is regarded as more important for policy purposes than the estimates at current prices, then the price basis for deflation needs as much attention as the price basis for valuation. It follows, also, that the separation indicated can be avoided if adequate attention is paid to the price basis of all value flows at current prices every year-even when available statistics supply, directly, only the value counterpart of some of these flows. Section II of this article examines the problem of lack of comparability in the available information on prices and volumes, in the context of the procedure used to obtain the Indian official national income statistics which give a distribution by industrial origin. Section III then considers the problem of valuation of the other distributions: by size, by final expenditures, and by regions. An examination of the distributions of national income in India other than the one by industrial origin shows that, in several cases, it is possible to split up many elements of the distributions into price and quantity counterparts. Of these, the quantity counterparts are usually more reliable than the price counterparts. The position is comparable with that observed about the distribution by industrial origin. The study of the price base of all available Indian national income distributions thus brings out several points. The salient point that emerges, however, is the relative weakness of the price base. Even in countries in which the income estimates are far from reliable, the price information may be weaker than the quantity information. To improve the national income estimates, to make the sectoral deflators reasonable, and to tie them up with other bodies of price information available in the country, it may be wiser then to concentrate first on the improvement of the price information in many of the sectors. Overall precision of the estimate of NDP may increase more quickly if this procedure is followed-unless, of course, it is established, on the basic of empirical studies, that the variability of price information is very much smaller than that of the quantity information.||M.

30/12/1972- ||special article||4362197||Mexican Economic Growth, 1940-45: Some Lessons||The pre-conditions for fast economic growth had already been laid when the Second World War suddenly changed the economic climate for Mexico. There was unused capacity, a strong economic and financial infrastructure and a growing agricultural surplus. The War years provided external stimuli to which the Mexican economy responded by realigning its structure for long-term growth. During this period, Mexico's gross domestic product grew at the unprecedented rate of 8.2 per cent per year. This rate of growth was achieved in conditions of a relatively low investment level and a frugal capital-output ratio. Although investment was not the driving force behind the fast rate of growth, it was located in key sectors like roads and railways and in mechinery and equipment. By 1945 the major problems of Mexican development could be perceived. These persist to date. They include the inability of this impressive rate of growth to improve the lot of the rural proletariat and urban unorganised labour and a propensity to make the rich richer. The government is unable to raise enough revenues from taxes and is therefore excessively dependent on monetary policy and inflation for promoting investment. The public sector remains subordinate to the private sector. Most of these problems converge on the structural defects of dualism which the import substituting model has led to.||Gurcharan Das

01/1/1972- ||special article||4360903||Taxation of Property and Net Wealth in India: A Note||This paper attempts a study of some aspects of direct taxation in India and analyses in detail the steps for introduction of a comprehensive and broad-based tax on property and net wealth. The analysis reveals the gaps in data on many aspects of wealth distribution. The study, therefore, devotes considerable space to the estimation of the various components of personal wealth and these by themselves throw important light on the economic structure and ownership pattern of wealth in the rural and urban sectors. Some of these aspects, no doubt, have profound implications for public economic policy. This study does not, however, elaborate these ramifications of the distribution of personal wealth. The objective of this study is limited to making estimates of the yields from a property and net wealth tax. The study leads to the conclusion that the yield from such a tax can vary from Rs 220 crores to Rs 350 crores per annum with rates varying from 0.5 per cent to 5 per cent. Compared to these estimates, the present yield of less than Rs 15 crores per annum appears to be a ridiculously paltry sum.

24/6/1972- ||review of management, june 1972||4361511||On the Allocative Efficiency under Risk in Transforming Traditional Agriculture||Agricultural sectors in the less-developed countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are under-going a spread of new seed varieties and an intensive application of fertiliser and irrigation inputs. It has been observed that, in the allocation of modern inputs, farmers apply a discounting factor on the expert advice because yields diverge considerably from those claimed by the agricultural scientists. It may be hypothesised that, in recent years, farmers may not be efficient in resource allocation in the pure profit maximisation sense as they are in a transition process of adopting new techniques whose outcomes are not so certain from the traditional wisdom, but they may still be found to allocate resources efficiently if the risk elements are taken into account. This paper aims at evaluating the allocative efficiency under: (i) the classical profit maximisation criterion with no risk of any sort, and (ii) an alternative criterion incorporating risk because of the probabilistic nature of estimates of production co-efficients. The data used in this paper pertain to the production of two varieties of wheat, Mexican and Local (Desi), in Punjab (Ferozpur) for 1967-68 and 1968-69. The sample size comprised 150 farmers selected on a stratified random basis. [The authors are indebted to Earl O Heady for his valuable suggestions and encouragement.

25/3/1972- ||special article||4361179||The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: III: Participation in Politics||Following Gandhi's assassination Golwalkar was arrested and the RSS was banned. Throughout the period of the ban (and after as well), the government assumed that the RSS was a political body. However, the government's assessment of the RSS's political nature was wrong, at least at that time. The government often considered the RSS to be the volunteer arm of the Hindu Mahasabha. But what connections the RSS had with the HM were extremely tenuous and these connections had virtually ceased in 1940. Upto the time of the ban, many swayamsevaks were members of the Congress. Hedgewar had refused to allow the RSS, as an organisation, to champion the cause of any political party. Until the ban on the RSS in 1948, Golwalkar gave the same advice. Members might participate in politics, but not as representatives of the RSS. The pracharaks (the full-time cadres) were, and still are, explicitly forbidden from being members of any political party. The ban shocked the swayamsevaks. Many felt that the RSS had to transform itself into a political party if the movement were to survive. Sardar Patel. then Home Minister, himself feared that it might do this. He sought to prevent this and to bring the RSS cadres into the Congress. For a time, it looked as if he might succeed. In October 1948 the Congress Working Committee ruled that RSS members were permitted to join the Congress. The Working Congress decision immediately set off a controversy within the Congress, with the supporters of Patel favouring the decision and the followers of Nehru opposing it. Eventually, Nehru persuaded the Congress Working Committee to deny membership to RSS men by stipulating that they could join, but only if they gave up their RSS membership. These developments prepared the ground for those elements in the RSS who proposed more direct political involvement receiving a hearing within the Sangh that would not have been possible earlier. [In the first part of this four-part narrative the origins and growth of the RSS were discussed. The second part examined the relationship between the RSS and the Hindu Mahasabha. In the fourth and final part, to be published next week, will be examined the genesis of the Jan Sangh and the role played by the RSS in its formation.]||Walter Andersen

1/8/1972- ||issues in education||4361676||Towards a More Work-Oriented Schooling||It is argued here that the schools can help substantially in the fight against poverty if, and only if, they undergo a fairly drastic process of curriculum reform. This means changes in the content of instruction, in the methods of instruction, and in the evaluation of achievement (examination reform). Merely 'more of the same' could be counter-productive by generating more alienated youth, unable to find readymade jobs for which they are suited or which suit them, and unable to generate their own jobs by self-employment and entrepreneurship. Educational leaders in India are agreed that instruction in the schools should be made more relevant to the world of work, to the future job needs of the youngsters, and to the country's need for efficient producers who can carry development forward. Strong recommendations to this effect were contained in the report of the Education Commission, 1966, and these have since been re-emphasised by many leaders. There is more agreement on these general aims, however, than on any strategy for implementing them. And, even where there is substantial agreement on strategy, experience demonstrates that much thought and effort are required to move from statements of objectives to actual implementation in the schools. Implementation in this field is a difficult and time-consuming process, and has not yet gone very far - though there are some promising efforts under way in certain states. This article, therefore, focuses on implementation. It offers for consideration a broad strategy by which the general aims can be sought. It also puts forward some specific suggestions on the designing of curriculum development and on the preparation of new instructional materials and methods. While the discussion that follows will be in terms of what can be done at the primary-secondary level in the formal school system, it will be obvious that many of these ideas are applicable (with appropriate adaptation) at other levels and in non-formal, out-of-school education as well. While this discussion concentrates on ways to prepare young people for better performance as producers and organisers - and thus as contributors to economic development - it is not intended to suggest that this is the only purpose of education. However, it is certainly one of the purposes. It is particularly important in a country where there is need for a radical increase in productivity as a foundation for progress towards major goals being sought - viz, better livelihood, social justice, self-reliance.||Eugene Staley

These propositions are discussed seriatim in the sections that follow.||Raj Krishna

09/9/1972- ||special articles||4361794||Currency Holding, Mobilisation of Savings, and Dangers of Inflationary Spending||There is a widespread misunderstanding of the nature and role of currency holding by the public - both absolutely and in relation to deposit holding with banks and other financial institutions. This has led to a gross overestimation of the role of such institutions in the mobilisation of saving. In fact, the popularly held view that deposit mobilisation is identical with saving mobilisation is largely, though not entirely fallacious. The fallacy and the misunderstanding become a matter of serious concern if they come to vitiate the thinking of official advisers and policy-makers. As illustrations of this, consider the following statements of the Banking Commission in its Report (1972): "[1] The holding of savings in the form of currency makes them currently infructuous from the social standpoint and [2] involves the constant danger of inflationary spending." (p 86); "[3] Increasing deposits with the banks will help to bring to the organised market savings that are idle, or are wasted..." (p 87; also p 571 - recommendation 4). "... [4] A part of funds of NBFIs [Non-Bank Financial Intermediaries] consists of deposits which are transfers from currency holdings and to that extent represents the process of resource mobilisation by financial institutions" (pp 414-15): Points [1],[3], and [4] relate to the same issue, viz, the role of financial assets in the mobilisation of saving, and are discussed together in the first part of the article. Point [2] is discussed separately in the last part of the article. [The author is grateful to K A Naqvi and G S Raychaudhuri for helpful suggestions on an earlier draft of this paper.]||Suraj Gupta

This concern calls for an examination of the election results with a view to understanding the slump in participation in the last parliamentary elections. Many dimensions need to be studied for a full understanding of electoral participation. Here an attempt is made to analyse voter turnout through four major dimensions. First, what has been the pattern of voting in past elections; second, how far is the de-linking of assembly elections from parliamentary elections responsible for a drop in the rate of participation; third, whether participation in elections is related to the degree of intensity of inter-party competition; and fourth, do certain select socio-economic variables explain variations in turnout.||R.

At the same time, the magnitude of inputs that have to be committed to projects has increased considerably making sub-optimal decisions very expensive. Hence the need to use advanced methods to aid decision-making. While there exist concepts and tools that allow a formal incorporation of these complex factors into decision-making, there has been a dearth of requisite data and a lack of capabilities to process the data quickly. Computers have now made possible the application of formal quantitative methods as aids to better decision-making. In this article are discussed some aspects of applying some of these quantitative concepts and tools to certain types of complex business problems. Specifically, the application of linear programming to product-mix planning in a textile mill and to scheduling problems in a transport undertaking are discussed.||V. L. Mote,B. G. Shah

23/9/1972- ||special articles||4361853||Vietnam and the 'Third Communist Front'||The North Vietnamese and the NLF, the North Koreans and the Cubans, had nursed the illusion, during the mid-sixties, that the grave situation in Vietnam would bring Russia and China together and make them co-ordinate their efforts to help the Vietnamese. At one point Castro so riled the men in the Kremlin by his forthrightness on Vietnam and other issues, that he came to be known in Moscow as "that Caribbean Viper in our bosom". Not only did he relentlessly condemn Moscow's cowardly policies but he attacked the Chinese leaders in no uncertain terms, calling them "old senile idiots fit to be kept in an old folk's home". But as his country became more dependent on Russian economic bolstering, Castro became totally silent about Moscow's dithering over Vietnam. The result is that now the Vietnamese are the sole frontline fighters against US imperialism, although the North Koreans continue to retain their suspicions about that Holy Trinity trotted out by Moscow and tacitly accepted by Peking - 'peaceful competition', 'peaceful transition', 'peaceful co-existence'. The unity of the 'Third Communist Front' has been disrupted, but the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people and the spectacle of the largest country in the world, the richest and the most formidably armed, bogged down in an endless war by a poor, non-industrialised but valiant people, continues to be of limitless inspiration to the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America.||Lajpat Rai

An eleven-point outline seeks to fill out and elaborate the basic parameters of the various manifestoes and programmes that have been handed out from time to time but whose implications have never been spelt out. An attempt is made here to raise certain specifics of political engineering and economic strategy that are involved in garibi hatao and to spell out its cultural and structural implications. It is necessary to realise that such a slogan-and it cannot be taken as a mere slogan as millions of people have voted for it and put their faith in it-has far-reaching implications. Implicit in it is what may be called a 'design for living' in which reason, compassion and regard for the equal worth of all men are joined together in the cultivation of a truly just and civilised society. In such a design the distinction between economic and political issues disappears and we begin to see the real linkages through which common values and goals can be realised.||Rajni Kothari

The paper thus indicates certain fundamental issues that need to be resolved before indigenous technology can flourish.

India is now in a position of indisputable dominance in South Asia. In a way this is not a welcome development for India's smaller neighbours, including Ceylon and Nepal. It invalidates their hitherto pursued strategy by restricting their diplomatic manoeuvrability within the region. It also deepens their existing psychological apprehension of India the 'colossus'. These doubts along with serious misgivings about 'separatist' movements - particularly on the part of Ceylon - occasioned the marked reluctance of the Ceylonese and Nepalese Governments to back the Bangla Desh movement in its earlier phases, in spite of considerable public sympathy within the two countries for the Bangla Desh struggle. Now that Bangla Desh is a fact, the national interests of the two countries are already moving the two states towards closer ties with Bangla Desh.||S. D. Muni,Urmila Phadnis

Its analysis of the factors influencing demand for fertilisers is thus aimed at enabling a better estimate of that demand. Judged in this perspective, the methodology of the report is highly suspect, the economics is entirely evanescent, and the projections diverge greatly from the actuals. In fact, such studies often do no more than document the obvious, after much statistical footwork. Nevertheless, this report teaches some valuable lessons. First, since with the best will it is extremely difficult to examine through highly macro-regression studies the myriad factors that affect a farmer's decision to use fertilisers and which interest the policy-makers, fertiliser demand studies henceforth should pay rather more attention to the economics of fertiliser use by building around disaggregated data on the physical response to, and costs of using, fertilisers in the farmer's field. Secondly, studies of fertiliser demand must devote more attention to the 'regressions' - the 'independent variables' - than they have done thus far, and a much larger proportion of their research effort to anticipating future technical and institutional developments than has been the custom till now. The third lesson is that, in a rapidly changing situation, the Government must design an information system that enables it to keep abreast of current developments, and organise the mass of ancillary information which exists today in an unuseable form. An advantage of organising studies around the data that are being collected is that it will be much easier to up-date the results and the estimates of the studies, and so to eliminate the limitations that arise from the 'one-shot' nature of earlier studies.||Arun Shourie

Utilising the admission data for the last five years, a number of findings emerge. Surely, merit and motivation are the only factors which are 'intended' to influence selection for admission. But that cannot rule out the 'unintended' consequences which might flow from some components of the selection process. The significant and dramatic trends repeating year after year make it naive to imagine that money is not influencing the making of a manager. The influence money has in determining the fate of a candidate is both indirect as well as unintended, although that does not make it any less important. The process through which this causal network really operates are identified here.||Baldev R. Sharma

If the expenditures on projects sanctioned by the term-lending institutions can be taken as an indicator of the level of investment in the entire private corporate sector, the conclusion that can be drawn is that private corporate investment in 1972 will exceed the level reached in 1972, but will stay slightly below the level reached in 1970. The industrywise break up suggests that in 1971 as much as Rs 93 crores of capital expenditure was made in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Indications are that in 1972 approximately Rs 75 crores of expenditure will be made in the chemical and pharmaceutical industry. There is likely to be a decline in investment in engineering and textiles. Investment in cement and transportation, including shipping, is likely to show a rise.||C. Rangarajan

The objectives finally set must keep in view (a) the minimal level indicated by the weighted average cost of capital and (b) the highest level theoretically attainable by exploiting all potential opportunities and by overcoming all future threats. Such possibilities have, of course, to be reviewed in the light of the strengths and weaknesses of the organisation and to be related to the past performance of the unit. The formulation of objectives is essentially a structured, formal process. The formal planning system needs to be carefully nurtured, particularly in the initial stages when it is being developed. But the organisation is then in a far stronger position than it otherwise would be.

A boom comes to an end when real wages have been pressed hard enough through a rise in food prices to reduce capacity utilisation; this comes about in the industrial necessaries sector by a fall in workers' consumption and in the other industrial sectors by a fall in investment especially of the government which is sensitive to the political implications of continuing inflation in food prices; the sensitivity of private investment to capacity utilisation creates a downward spiral leading to a slump; finally the growing unemployment and the slowing down of inflation create conditions for a new spurt of industrial growth as government investment picks up once again and so eventually does private investment. Of course, the Indian economy since the inception of planning has been subject to so many different influences and factors that it would be nonsensical to expect it to exhibit a neat pattern of cycles in line with the predictions of any simple model. It cannot, however, be denied that cyclical movements arising from disproportionality (and bearing in mind that agriculture itself grows discontinuously) have embedded themselves in the overall dynamics of the economy. The model developed in this paper addresses itself to this problem. In the concluding section of the paper, the author brings together briefly some of the implications of the model, specifically for inflationary recession and more generally for growth with disproportionality.

1/2/1972- ||growth experience||4361017||Farm Mechanisation in a Labour-Abundant Economy||In India, the cost of biological sources of energy seems to be increasing relative to that of mechanical sources even though unemployment and underemployment have been growing. It may be argued that this has happened because farm machinery has been made artificially cheap or because farmers tend to overinvest for lack of alternative opportunities. But available evidence does not support these arguments. Certain types of mechanisation, such as the use of farm tractors, need not lead to unemployment in regions of expanding agricultural output because they are used in response to genuine shortage and high cost of draft power. Insofar as tractors save the resources allocated for maintaining of draft animals and enable an increase in output by raising cropping intensity and yield per acre, their use may prove to be socially beneficial in the context of the shortage and high prices of agricultural commodities. The rise in the scale of operations - through the rise in cropping intensity and yield per acre - made possible by tractorisation, can lead to a net rise in farm employment. However, insofar as the incentive for mechanisation is provided by the rising supply price of labour consequent to the rise in prices of foodgrains, certain types of mechanisation - such as the use of combine harvesters - may become profitable, even when harvest labour is not in short supply. Since, unlike tractors, combine harvesters displace mainly human labour and since the land-augmenting potential is limited in this case, they may not prove to be socially beneficial at the present stage. The policy for farm mechanisation needs, therefore, to be selective. Since mechanisation represents substitution of capital for labour, it may lead to a reduction in the relative share of wages in agricultural output, even when output and employment rise. However, for the same reason, marketed surpluses of foodgrains and of agricultural commodities may increase. The increased supply of wage-goods for the non-farm sector could help to create a larger volume of employment than is otherwise possible. Therefore, selective farm mechanisation - especially of the land-augmenting type such as tractorisation - can substantially raise the overall employment potential in the economy.

03/6/1972- ||special article||4361440||Studies in Planning Techniques: V: Planning for Industrialisation||The Indian approach to industrialisation has been the subject of a great deal of controversy over the years; there is still no sign of any narrowing of the gap between different schools of thought. To some extent, the discussion among economists has been one-sided; while those who place great reliance on market forces have been very articulate in their criticism of the policies actually followed in India, an equally cogent statement of the rationale behind these policies is not available. As a result, there has been some confusion of the role of planning in promoting industrialisation. An attempt is, therefore, made in this paper to present a statement of the strategy followed in India and thus to arrive at the techniques of planning appropriate for the efficient implementation of this strategy. In fact, it is the contention of this paper that planning techniques have to be related to the underlying strategy of development, and should be evaluated in terms of such a strategy. Hence, it is a major objective of the present essay to formulate the chosen strategy in a coherent manner, as a step towards searching out ways to improve the techniques of planning being followed. This is the fifth and last in the series of studies by the author in planning techniques.||R. M. Sundrum

Answers to questions pertaining to tractor use and tractor economics could therefore be sought from a study of mechanisation on Punjab farms. A field inquiry was conducted in 13 villages in the state in 1970-71 with a view to investigating questions such as: (i) who owns tractors, (ii) how is their purchase financed, (iii) to what uses are they put, and (iv) what is the economic viability of tractors of different-sized holdings.

Where 10 years ago these items of equipment were rarities, even oddities, they are now in many parts of India a commonplace. Farm mechanisation in India with its large numbers of rural landless and underemployed labour is an important but complex issue, about which there is increasing concern and argument but so far relatively little quantitative analysis. This paper describes the extent of tractor, power thresher, irrigation pump, and tubewell ownership and use, in the districts selected in 1967 for a Government sponsored evaluation of certain aspects of the High-Yielding Varieties Programme (HYVP). The data are from farm surveys made in 1967-8, 1968-9 and 1969-70, by the Programme Evaluation Organisation (PEO) of the Planning Commission. It should be noted that the PEO surveys were not primarily designed to give information on mechanisation. However, some useful data about mechanisation were collected and these will be used to make a broad quantitative assessment of the pattern of mechanisation which has emerged since the introduction of the High-Yielding Varieties Programme in 1966. Regional disparities are treated in the first part of the paper, while part II examines in more detail the wheat belt of the Indo-Gangetic plain. The third part deals with the extent to which use of tractors has spread to farms without their own machines, the types of farm operations in which tractors are used, and the effect of tractors on rural employment.

26/8/1972- ||special articles||4361737||Economic Growth and Educational Development: Lessons from the Case of Japan||Despite twenty years of planned development behind them, developing countries have not yet achieved the stage of self-sustained growth. This post-War experience could be interpreted in two ways. One, consistent with the notion of 'accelerated' economic development, would be to inquire whether the failure was due to inadequate capital formation, less emphasis on social development, or poor administration. The other, is to raise a number of interesting and more fundamental questions, answers to which may alter currently held views about the nature and process of economic development. The focal point of such research, then, is not the search for a factor or factors that have to be stressed to accelerate the rates of growth to preconceived levels, but the discovery of the right relationships or proportions among the various factors of development which, if observed, would ensure an organic and vigorous development of the economy. Perhaps the most important method of discovering these relationships is to proceed on the assumption that the process of economic development is essentially an organic process and that the proportions observed in the early stages of development in the advanced countries are relevant for other countries also. Thus the main purpose of this paper is to suggest that an analysis of the early stages of development in the history of the advanced nations, comparable to the stages in which the underdeveloped countries find themselves today, will be of considerable practical use for providing guidelines for the development of the underdeveloped areas. This thought is developed and illustrated by tracing Japan's educational development in the earlier stages, and comparing it with the conditions and targets of some of the Asian countries. The educational sector has been selected mainly because it is one of the sectors in which applicability of economic calculus is found difficult, and the danger of fixing over-ambitious targets is ever present.

Western interests and the national interests of the two local major conservative powers-Iran and Saudi Arabia-coincide in the Gulf. The two inter-connected basic concerns of the West, and of Iran and Saudi Arabia, are to maintain the flow of oil and to retain the conservative-feudal political systems prevalent in the area. In doing this, a 'division of work' has been agreed upon between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran, with its strong navy and air force, is expected to guard the waters and coasts of the Gulf and not let any 'revolutionary' movements develop in the shaikhdoms, nor allow infiltration from the south or the north. Saudi Arabia's role, with its increasing military power, political prestige and oil money, is to see that the 'revolutionary' movements on the fringe of the Arabian peninsula are reversed or localised. Kuwait is the third linchpin helping to maintain the status quo in the vulnerable Gulf shaikhdoms.||M. A. Saleem Khan

However, this paper claims that a judicious balance can be found in a situation of rising productivity which may lead not only to a higher rate of capital formation but also to a reasonable standard of living for the workers who can secure this by being organised. It is argued here that the wage variation in the Indian manufacturing sector has been influenced by increase in productivity. Yet, there is need for a wage policy which not only provides for an equitable sharing in the gains of productivity but also ensures the containment of inflationary pressures in the economy.

A present-value approach is developed to evaluate Action Training projects; Human Resource Accounting concepts have been extended to evaluate the impact of Developmental Training. A procedure is also evolved for capitalising investments in training. [An earlier version of this paper was presented at the III ISTD National Convention in Madras, held in April.

Several factors may affect the choice of assets. This paper does not attempt to quantify any of these factors. It is confined, instead, to an analysis of income-tax concession which is one of the factors affecting the rate of return on different financial assets eligible for such concessions. Section I of the paper discusses the nature of tax rebate under the two existing types of income-tax concessions. The effect of these concessions on income from different types of assets is analysed in Section II. In Section III are examined savings in life insurance policies and contributions to the unit-linked insurance plan. Section IV states some important conclusions. It has been argued that tax concession, granted at present to income from specified financial assets, should be discontinued. For, while such concession benefits investment which has already been made, concession in the form of deduction would be available only to additional savings in these forms. But this argument overlooks two things. First, exemption of specified income may increase future investment in such savings. Second, in order to enjoy the continued benefit of this concession a saver will have to remain generally in a saved-in position, particularly if savings are in the form of fixed deposits and units - though, in respect of life policies and provident funds, after enjoying the benefit of tax deduction, a person may, and many do, draw loans from their policy or PF accounts. It is therefore argued here that tax exemption in respect of income from savings in fixed deposits and units should be continued.

25/11/1972- ||review of management, november 1972||4362059||Translating Organisational Objectives into Programme Targets and Operating Tasks||While strategic planning involves the formulation of organisational objectives by top management, the attainment of those goals involves at least two other distinct management planning and control processes. First, the long-range organisational objectives have to be translated into short-run (usually one-year) targets of accomplishment; and secondly, functional tasks have to be specified for attaining the short-run organisational targets. This paper seeks to establish an operational framework for translating long-run organisational goals into short-run budgets and operational targets and schedules. It contends that the effectiveness of such a process of transformation depends essentially on a number of factors: viz, the explicit formation of short-run organisational objectives by top management based on viable analyses of the external situation; the designing of budget formats to ensure that in target development all relevant bases are touched; the target review process; and the monitoring process, recycling information into future planning.

It is therefore concerned with how the Indian economy functions and what factors determine the direction and momentum of its evolution. The paper's secondary concern is with the future prospects of development. Section I studies agrarian relations; Section II studies industry, trade, and commerce; Section III deals with the much discussed topic of poverty in India; and Section IV relates to the implications of foreign investment and technical collaboration. Section V then presents a unified system analysis of the economy's operation. Three striking facts emerge in the course of the analysis: first, that between 1939 and 1969 the real wage rate of factory workers has remained virtually stagnant; secondly, that the share of wages in the value of total factory output has been declining; and thirdly, that despite practically unlimited supplies of labour at low and constant wage rates the scramble for importing capital-intensive technology continues and that this is in fact highly profitable. In attempting to throw light on these facts, the paper constructs a new theory of income distribution in a semi-feudal open economy such as India's. The outlines of this theory are thus presented in Section VI. Section VII proceeds to analyse the contradictions inherent in the current growth process in the economy, tracing some of the dynamics of future growth. Section VIII has some concluding remarks. [The author alone is responsible for the entire contention of this paper.]||Ranjit K. Sau

An underdeveloped region such as Tripura offers very limited scope for employment in other industries and construction workers are particularly vulnerable because they are not organised. While organised workers can bargain to improve their conditions of work, their counterparts in construction and similar other industries have to look to the government for safeguarding their interests.||S.

26/2/1972- ||special articles||4361081||On the Economic Theory of Socialism: An Exercise in Value Theory and Its Applicability to Indian Conditions||In planning for rapid industrial growth consistent with the maximisation of social welfare, the planning process cannot rest merely on the setting of physical targets (indicative or otherwise). Nor can the objective be attained only by preparing a "shelf of projects", important as this approach is. There is need, of course, to work out a set of consistent targets, in line with social need, and to prepare (or encourage the preparation of) a whole series of technical feasibility reports (for individual projects, again consistent with overall social benefit. But these cannot be translated into actual, working units without active, purposeful control of investment funds-and their direction. Nor can an inflationary rise in prices be prevented without the direct intervention of fiscal policy. In both areas, we have so far generally followed the line of least resistance. The time has come when, if our experiment at a "mixed economy" is to succeed in promoting rapid growth, we have to make more vigorous use of these instruments to subserve the universally accepted economic criterion of maximisation of welfare.

The current (27th) Round of the NSS is designed to collect information which is expected to throw light on the several relevant characteristics of unemployment which may help in understanding the anatomy of unemployment. In the meanwhile, the 25th Round of the NSS has collected comprehensive information for "the lowest 10 per cent of households having some cultivated land" and "households having no cultivated land" for the reference period, July 1969 to June 1970. Some of the data collected in the state samples have been tabulated manually and indicate the number of mandays spent in farm work and non-farm work, the days spent in non-gainful activities and the days spent in seeking work or for which a person was available for work. The discussion in this paper is based on data from 10 states for which information is available.

No longer is the debate concerned with the trivia of continuing the existing distribution of plan funds, of required rates of growth, of the size of the plan and of problems of raising the required financial resources. The issues discussed are major ones: What is planning for? Does present planning assure welfare to the masses? Given the objectives, what is to be the strategy of planning? It is these issues which need clearer definition if the experience of the past is not to be repeated. This article deals with some of the issues-and pseudo-issues-which have arisen during the pre-Fifth Plan debate.||Phiroze B. Medhora

07/10/1972- ||special articles||4361915||Prospects of Controlling Population in India||During the last decade and a half there have been major shifts in the government's approach to family planning: the emphasis shifted from the 'clinic' approach to the 'extension' approach, then to the IUCD, and finally to the present 'target-oriented time-bound' approach. Organisationally there has been a distinct trend towards family planning becoming more and more a 'vertical' programme with dwindling links with the general health services. The family planning programme now has an elaborate network of services to cover the entire country. Institutions have also been created to support the programme by providing training, evaluation and research services. However, the performance of the programme has been grossly inadequate for achieving the prescribed objectives. The programme formulators have made a fundamental mistake in overlooking the fact that certain social and economic factors make the key contributions to the generation of motivation for the small family norm; that it is patently unrealistic to accept some ill-qualified, ill-trained and ill-suited persons to motivate people to accept family planning. They are equally simplistic in expecting that pressure of the revenue staff and lure of the 'enhanced incentives' of mass vasectomy camps will provide the solution. Apart from being abhorrent to the proclaimed guiding principles of the programme, this approach has also raised a number of moral, ethical, political and demographic issues.||D. Banerji

It has been entrusted with full powers of investigation-that is, not only the power to examine under oath any witnesses it wishes to and summon any evidence necessary for its investigation but also that to initiate investigations on its own without waiting for a reference by the government. More important, the Commission's verdict in a restrictive trade practices case is, like an order of a court, final and binding. Contravention of the Commission's order is a punishable offence, though the defendant can appeal against it to the Supreme Court. The first case of restrictive trade practices just referred to the Commission by the Registrar of Restrictive Trade Agreements relates to the code of conduct adopted by eight tyre manufacturers under which they have agreed upon the minimum prices below which they will not sell their products. As this is the first case of restrictive trade practices that has come up before the Commission, this note seeks to briefly evaluate the provisions relating to the investigation and control of restrictive trade practices contained in Chapter IV of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act.||A.

In this article, the variability that existed within this relationship by crops, seasons, regions and years, in the period 1966-67 to 1968-69 is examined. Also examined are a number of factors which may underlie the relationship. The authors conclude that, although credit appears to be important, uncertainty may be the critical constraint to adoption among small farmers. Credit availability and uncertainty are interrelated factors, but depending on which is taken to be the crux of the problem, policies undertaken to facilitate adoption among small farmers are bound to be different. It is also noted that, for some crops, small farmers who adopt the new varieties plant a higher proportion of acreage with them than do large farmers. This may be due to a labour restraint on the larger farms. That possibility, and its policy implications, are examined.

The problems examined here concern the internal security of Bangladesh and the maintenance of a border force, particularly for patrolling the area adjoining the frontier with Burma to prevent minority insurgent elements from moving from one side of the border to the other. The connected issues of whether Bangladesh should have a standing professional army or a militia and whether Mukti Bahini personnel should be absorbed into the armed forces are also examined.||K.

A population policy will appeal to the masses only when it modifies the factors that adversely affect an individual family. A precondition for the success of a population policy is thus that a minimally decent level of living be ensured, as at very low levels of income, limitation of the family size seems subjectively irrelevant or even inadvisable. Thus a certain level of economic development, ensuring at least full subsistence to the populace, is necessary if a population control policy is to be successful in any country.||Atreyi Chatterjee

Such an analysis is also of interest in view of suggestions that the manipulations of government deposits can serve as an instrument of monetary policy in countries where open market operations are likely to be inefficient, while it is not likely to lead to the undesirable repercussions inherent in variable reserve requirement. This paper analyses the potential scope for manipulating government deposits as an instrument of monetary policy in underdeveloped countries.

Since the per capita agricultural income is lower and agricultural incomes are less unevenly distributed, the main issue for consideration is equalising, as far as possible, the incidence of direct taxation on comparable income and wealth groups irrespective of the source of such income or the form in which wealth is held. It is mainly to this issue that the Committee on Taxation of Agricultural Wealth and Income has addressed itself.||M. L. Dantwala

08/4/1972- ||special articles||4361226||A Policy Frame for Self-Reliance||The purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it is an attempt to develop an analytical framework for consideration of appropriate policies for premature self-reliance in a developing economy, dependent on foreign aid to finance part of its planned deficit in external payments or investment requirements. The need for such an analytical framework arises because while all developing countries frequently profess their anxiety to achieve self-reliance as soon as possible, none has tried to define this objective in an operationally meaningful way or attempted to devise a policy frame which would make the objective credible either to themselves or to their benefactors. The second object of this paper is to examine the issue of self-reliance in the wake of suspension of United States aid to India, particularly with reference to the Fourth Plan - or what is left of it.||Bimal Jalan

A Study of Some Progressive Farmers in Mysore and Punjab||The majority of field studies, carried out in India over the past few years, have shown that the relatively more successful farmers are those with large holdings. However, a number of recent studies have substantiated that medium-size farmers, and even small-holders, can attain very remarkable results. This study contributes some evidence to this controversial issue. It attempts, however, to look at it in a broader perspective, viz, What are the prominent features of the more recent agricultural development process, and what role do progressive farmers play in this process? The second major problem with which this study deals is sociological. It is often suggested that the new agricultural development is connected with changes in the structure of rural societies, and also that the discontent of the less privileged groups is rising. How far can village society cope with such difficulties? [The author carried out this study during a year's research leave in India from August 1971 until August 1972. This article is based on a more detailed study report: "Progressive Farmers and Their Share in Agricultural Modernisation - Preliminary Report on a Study in Mysore and Punjab", Bangalore, July 1972, mimeo.]||Peter von Blanckenburg

But the whole educational struture betrays serious weaknesses of a fundamental character which appear to be more or less inherent in our economic-political system. A number of surveys clearly show that the spread of literacy and education is much more in evidence among the affluent and socially advanced sections of society. Elite formation during the post-Independence period is, therefore, very important for assessing the educational situation. In terms of social differentiation, the fall-our from our educational system can be briefly described as follows: (i) emergence and consolidation of a 'super' elite at the top - consisting of the old urban intelligentsia and a sprinkling of the more enterprising elements of rural stock - in technology, industry, business and in the higher echelons of the bureaucracy and the defence services; (ii) formation of a fairly large 'common' or 'regional' elite, consisting of the urban middle and lower salaried groups, skilled and semi-skilled technicians and professionals and of the newly emerging rural groups; and (iii) continuance of stark illiteracy in the rest of society at the base of the pyramid, with a slow and sluggish movement among small sections towards basic literacy and rudimentary education. It becomes obvious that this situation is full of strains, full of contradictions and conrontations.||A. R. Kamat

15/1/1972- ||special articles||4360953||Working Force in 1971 Census: Some Exercises on Provisional Results||While the Census is a major and most convenient source of information on the working force, its results need to be analysed carefully to ensure comparability and accuracy. A superficial glance at the 1971 Census data, for instance, indicates the need for cautious interpretation. While the population increased by about 2.2 per cent per annum between 1961 and 1971, the working force declined from 189 million to 184 million. Even the figures for males, which are generally more reliable, seem to be understatements. The same bias appears present in the crude participation rates. To some extent, the decline in participation rates reflects changes in concepts. It is likely, too, that the enumerators chose in many cases not to record the newly required subsidiary information. Changes in the industrial distribution of the working force are a major indicator of changes in the level of economic development, but any under-reporting of the working force as a whole might distort the industrial distribution. The share of agriculture in the total working force has declined over the decade. But this may not reflect progressive diversification of economic activity. The trends are different among different states; and, generally, while the share of cultivators has declined that of agricultural labourers in most states has risen sharply. This may be because 'marginal workers' mainly cultivators, were excluded from the recording. Moreover, we do not yet know the magnitude and composition of the unspecified component which has been bracketed with non-agriculture. If that element is smaller than in the other Censuses, our preliminary conclusions about diversification may be upset.||J. Krishnamurty

The 'New Economics' does not give a simple solution to the naive problem of GNP vs non-GNP objectives, growth vs justice. In fact, that is not at all the correct problem. The really fundamental question is: The economic interests of which classes will the government serve, and how? The present political system in India can be classified as an intermediate regime in the sense of Kalecki. Numerically the petty bourgeoisie and rich peasantry are a large group, much larger than the big bourgeoisie or even the industrial working class. This numerical strength, together with a balancing act between the workers and peasants on the one hand and the big bourgeoisie and the remnants of feudalism on the other, facilitates the continuation of their power. The 'New Economics' is the economics of this intermediate regime. If the 'prevalent' economic theory is for the big bourgeoisie, the 'New Economics' is for the petty bourgeoisie, big bourgeoisie, rich peasantry and feudal remnants, all rolled up into one, against the workers and peasants. No wonder such economics as yet remains to be fully worked out; the path is as yet not at all clear. The resources once committed to luxury goods may now be partly diverted to commodities of mass consumption like bus transport or houses for the 'poor'-the petty bourgeoisie. The institutions which had been created for promoting faster growth and capital accumulation will no longer be permitted to frustrate the attempts for better 'distribution' and greater 'social justice'-in favour of the petty bourgeoisie and rich peasantry. And to foot the bill for all this, the exploitation of the workers and peasants will become more excruciating than ever before. This is the crux of the 'New Economics'. Everything else about it is either incidental or peripheral.||Ranjit Sau

Laws against untouchability and against discrimination by caste and the reservation of seats in educational institutions and jobs are, between them, expected to clear the ground for the equality of the Scheduled Castes. Education is expected to clear the ground for the quality of the Scheduled Castes. Education is expected to equip them to occupy the ground thus cleared. While the purpose behind the generous provision of educational facilities for the Scheduled Castes is clear and well-reasoned, the approach is naive in its assumptions, viz, (a) that the facilities provided would be optimally and equitably used; (b) that given the opportunity for school and college education, members of the Scheduled Castes would measure up on par with those who are backed by a tradition of formal education; and, (c) that the policy of reservations would best serve the attainment of equality for the Scheduled Castes. Experience indicates that these assumptions are unrealistic and educational programmes based on them have led to the perpetuation of old inequalities and the creation of some new ones. This paper presents some data regarding the situation of Scheduled Caste students in higher education in the country in general and in Maharashtra in particular to indicate the nature of the anomalies that exist.||Suma Chitnis

However, despite the nearly universal acceptance of the importance of corporate planning there is unfortunately a lack of a common understanding of: (a) what constitutes planning; (b) to what extent planning can and need be formalised; and, (c) where it fits in the broad framework of planning and control activities.

02/12/1972- ||special articles||4362091||Conservative Influence of Liberalism: Indian Reappraisals||In spite of the familiar indices of progress little has changed in the 25 years of the country's independence in regard to two crucial matters. First, all evidence suggests that no progress has been made in reducing the absolute numbers of those who live below the poverty line. Second, little progress has been made in destroying privilege. Some of the most odious forms of privileges have indeed been done away with; but new privileges have replaced these. In fact, many of the policies and instruments that were designed to destroy the advantages of the privileged and the propertied appear in retrospect to have buttressed the very advantages they were intended to eliminate. From a Marxian standpoint, the explanation is straightforward; one has only to look at the class composition of the ruling elite to observe that this elite was very distant from the masses. From this standpoint, the crater-like loopholes that were deliberately left in the land reforms legislation of this period and the failure of the government to enforce even such legislation as was enacted, come as no surprise. What else could one expect from a political party, the rural organisation of which was in the hands of the kulaks and which was dependent for its finances on the urban rich? I shall not pursue this line of enquiry into the fundamentals. Instead, in section III, I will focus on five aspects of the mental makeup of the elite that help exemplify the concrete ways in which the class background of this elite has manifested itself. Before doing so, however, in section II, I will briefly sketch some aspects of the dominant Indian view about the ways in which the country could be changed. In section IV, I will record some recent changes.||Arun Shourie

Since changes in the profitability of an undertaking may occur because of a variety of reasons, not necessarily connected with the performance of management, the task is one of separating the part of change in profitability between two accounting periods which can be attributed to the performance of management as distinct from the rest. The Bihar Road Transport Corporation is a typical state-owned and operated public utility undertaking. The period chosen for study is from 1959-60 to 1965-66 (upto the end of the Third Plan) and comparisons for the purpose of assessing management's performance have been made between consecutive financial years.

There are probably very few plan models that really give a great deal of important guidance to those who are engaged in actual preparation of plans; in any case that kind of guidance is the wrong thing to look for in the book by Eckaus and Parikh. But the lessons other model-makers may draw from the results presented in the book are enormous. These are lessons that cannot be drawn from any economic theory nor from any amount of exercises with algebra or calculus, but require exactly the type of repeated numerical exercises with parameter variations that Eckaus and Parikh have carried out.||Ashok Rudra

More equitable distribution of land would thus result in more employment and income for small farmers apart from contributing to the more efficient use of the available resources. The contribution of the proposed ceilings on agricultural land-holdings consists not so much in the 'surplus' land that is likely to be made available for distribution among the landless as in arresting or slowing down the growth of capitalist farming in agriculture. A substantial contribution of the current drive for ceilings is to be found in the sale of land by the big land owners and in their reluctance to acquire more land in future. If this be made the major objective of ceilings - as it ought to be - then ceiling on ownership holdings as presently contemplated will have to be combined with ceiling on operational holdings and ceiling on the future acquisition of land.||C.

The choice of the relevant sets of variables would depend on whether one is doing inter-country comparisons or inter-regional comparisons within a country, subject of course to the general constraints of data availability.

In particular, the value-free stance of sociology and its paradoxical espousal of 'policy-relevant' social research has engendered deep resentment and anguish. Its critics strongly feel that sociology, in its obsession with scientism, has become an ally of the repressive regime of technocracy. Scientific sociology is not only becoming inimical to radical social change but wittingly or unwittingly also lends support to the forces of injustice.

Consequently, it was considered important to involve panchayati raj institutions, community development blocks, schools, and primary health centres; (2) Participation of voluntary agencies, both within and outside the block; and (3) An active involvement of the local communities and leadership in the field of co-operation, panchayat, and voluntary associations. In view of the above considerations, the following organisational issues relating to these projects seem important: (1) What is the rationale behind the assignment of the implementation responsibility of the projects to the Central Social Welfare Board, and the State Welfare Advisory Board? In other words, why was the Central Social Welfare Board considered uniquely suitable to implement these projects? (2) What made the planners believe that the existing organisational set-up is best suited to achieving co-operation and co-ordination at the state and the block levels? Are the conditions necessary for interorganisational co-ordination present in the existing organisational arrangements? (3) Is the Mukhya Sevika, responsible for bringing about co-ordination in the services at the block level, trained in the necessary skills and other attributes to perform the co-ordinator's role effectively?

Some of our best insights into kinship, religion and local-level politics come from intensive studies made by social anthropologists using the method of participant-observation. Although this approach has so far been used mainly in the study of village communities, it can be applied to the investigation of practically any sector of contemporary society. Given the difficulties of discussing the method of intensive fieldwork (or participant-observation) in formal and abstract terms, many social anthropologists and sociologists feel that it would be useful, as an alternative, to discuss in a concrete and specific way the problems they encountered in the course of their own research. Such descriptions not only will enable the reader to view the anthropologist's analysis of his particular community in a better perspective, but will also provide some guidance to future research workers. If we are able to accumulate a sufficiently large number of such descriptions, it may be possible to evolve some guidelines as to what one should look for in a particular range of field situations, and how one should set about looking for it. In this paper the author describes, mainly with two ends in view, some of his experiences as a fieldworker in a village in Tanjore district in Tamilnad where he lived for a little less than a year in 1961-62. He tries, first, to show the kinds of constraints that most investigators doing fieldwork under similar conditions have to face. He also tries to show how he gained some of his deepest insights into the society and culture that he was investigating in the very process of trying to cope with these constraints.||Andre Beteille

Elections here were just one more arena where the leaders of bitterly hostile unions, leading equally hostile political parties, could test their strength. Traditional allegiances, such as to one's caste, village and kin group, seemed to have no more than marginal relevance in this context.

The pricing policy of public enterprises in India, therefore, has to be determined keeping in full view the context and the logic of the mission to be fulfilled. Abstraction from the secondary attributes of a phenomenon and concentration on its basic scaffolding have always been the primary tools of all analytical efforts. However, any analysis of the pricing policy of Indian public enterprises that is blind to the crucial perspective is senseless, if not also harmful. Here we shall analyse the pricing policy of public enterprises in India in the light of this recognition. To begin with, we shall go into the British and French schools of pricing policy, and then turn briefly to the debate in the Soviet Union, the socialist countries of Eastern Europe, and China. Finally, after this long tour, we shall return to India.||Ranjit K. Sau

18/3/1972- ||special articles||4361149||The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh: II: Who Represents the Hindus?||Upto 1937 the Hindu Mahasabha was a loosely organised group collected around prominent individuals. The two major issues dividing the reformers (in the Hindu Mahasabha), led by Lajpat Rai and Sharaddhanand, from the Sanatanists (the orthodox ones), led by Parmanand, Munje and Kelkar, were the elimination of caste restrictions and political participation. In 1937 Savarkar was elected President of the Mahasabha and settled these differences by resolving to build it into a political organisation representing the Hindus. By turning the Hindu Mahasabha into a political organisation, Savarkar ensured that whatever support the RSS had rendered to the Mahasabha would cease. Many RSS members were active in the Congress. And the RSS did not want to be associated with a group which would have placed it in direct opposition to the Congress. During World War II, the Mahasabha sought to enroll Hindus in the army and to negotiate with the British to get itself represented on various government councils. This policy was to fail. The British at the Simla Conference in June, 1945 treated the Congress as the representative of caste Hindus and the Muslim League as the representative of the Muslims. The weakness of the Hindu Mahasabha was the more apparent because - unlike the RSS - it lacked any youth, peasant or para-military foundations. It tried to make up for this lack by appealing to the RSS, but in vain. It could not become a mass organisation because so many of its supporters were big landlords who were unwilling to allow any hint of mass mobilisation. Meanwhile, the RSS - due to its unstinted help to Hindu refugees during and after partition - had increased its influence throughout northern India. In the first part of this four-part narrative, the origins and growth of the RSS were dicussed. The next part covers Gandhi's assassination and the subsequent banning of the RSS. The fourth and final part discusses the genesis of the Jan Sangh and the role played by the RSS in its formation.||Walter Andersen

A cross-section study is attempted for this purpose of all the districts in Maharashtra through a multiple regression analysis. With the help of the parameters governing economic factors, one can estimate the demand, identify the districts deficient in roads, and know the magnitude of the deficiency. The authors stress, however, that such an approach can not substitute an intensive survey of each region, which alone can reveal facts such as areas not developing due to lack of roads, the nature and adequacy of the access to each village, seasonal viability of roads, and economic feasibility of reducing roundaboutness.

The linkage perspective of urban politics offered here has been drawn inductively from data gathered on location in the city of Indore - data on the socio-economic composition of its population, on the background and recruitment of political leaders, the patterns of competition to be found among its organised groups or in its decision-making processes and, finally, on its political outcomes and governmental performance. The linkage pattern derived from the urban political system may be generalisable to other Indian cities, but validation of this supposition will have to await evidence from other urban locations. [This article and the larger study are based on field research conducted in Madhya Pradesh in 1967-68, and were made possible by a fellowship from the American Institute of Indian Studies and a grant from the Southern Asian Institute of Columbia University. Neither institution is responsible for the views expressed here. The paper has benefited from the perceptive criticism of earlier drafts by John Vieg, Leo Flynn, Franklin Tugwell and Roderick Church, but the responsibility for any errors and the final product remains mine alone. Most of the data and micro-analyses supporting the generalisations in this paper are to be found in my "Area, Linkage and Power in Indore: A Political Map of an Indian City," Columbia University, unpublished Ph D dissertation, 1970.]||Rodney W.

Much of this environment is hostile to human life at its most basic physiological level. Despite the very acute housing shortage and the increasing scale of slums in urban Gujarat generally, the outlay on housing in the state as a percentage of total outlay has been reduced in the Fourth Plan compared to under the Third Plan. The percentage is also much below the comparable provisions in the all-India plans. This article examines the major factors retarding housing activities in Ahmedabad and suggests measures that might help alleviate housing conditions in the city.||Mahesh Bhatt

In India, however, the drug price index calculated on the basis of the prices of a static group of drugs had risen by 41.9 points by 1970-71 with 1961-62 as the base. The rise was sharp after 1965-66 which, by a remarkable coincidence, was also the period when the Government of India referred the costs and prices of a few selected drugs to the Tariff Commission for study. The highest annual increase of 12 points occurred in 1970-71 with the announcement of the Drug Prices Control Order. The 18 drugs for which prices have been fixed constitute less than 9 per cent of the total value of drugs marketed. In this study an analysis has been attempted of different categories of drugs outside the purview of the Drug Prices Control Order and of the impact of the one public sector undertaking in the pharmaceutical industry on the prices of drugs. The closely linked problem of quality control and the efficacy of drugs has also been dealt with.||P. S. Agarwal,P. K. Ramachandran,B. V. Rangarao

1/2/1972- ||towards a new economics||4361007||Marx, Weber and India Today||The capacity and initiative of the bourgeoisie to establish its own hegemony over developing civil society had been essential to the transition from feudalism to capitalism. Marx's own observations are quite explicit in this respect and constitute a major plank of the Marxian theory of historical change. Then again the working class must go in for activising an alternative force of social hegemony to counterpose the socialist challenge against bourgeois order. Antonio Gramsci defined and elaborated this task and emphasised that "the rise of a new class is associated with the creation of a Weltanschauung". And to create a Weltanschauung of the kind that is historically important, the Marxian instruments of transformation do necessarily comprehend all that is known to be the motive force of social change in Weber's model. Thus the apparent conflict between the positions of Marx and Weber is considerably reduced, even though the focus of analysis was not the same for the two authors. The reality of contemporary capitalism, of its contradictions, development and backwardness, in most of the underdeveloped and developing countries, provides us with historical situations, characterised by the atrophy of civil society, perpetual crisis of the economy, and veritable confusion of state power. The writer proceeds to the analysis of our socio-economic problem in terms of specifics like the collapse of the production principle and the dominating role of bureaucracy, and of their connection with the question of immature civil society. Historically, the truth of such immaturity is written in the whole story of Indian capitalism, of its failure to combine its own enrichment with the conditions of sufficient economic growth. On the other hand, all this makes us realise how inadequate 'economism' or 'political economism' of the Indian kind is as an example of Marxian praxis. To be meaningful and effective, the socialist challenge has to work itself out as an alternative, non-conformist force within the social body, and not merely as abrupt adventures to produce a coup d'etat, nor as an opportunistic means to score spurious election victories. [A preliminary draft of this article was presented at the Seminar on 'Historical Models of Tradition and Change in India', held at the Indian Institute of Advanced Study, Simla, in October, 1969. This article is due to be published in the IIAS Transactions Volume on the subject.]||Asok Sen

His successor, Amin, has demonstrated a capacity to bring the army, at least for some time to come, under his personal control by changing its ethnic composition and increasing its responsibilities. Will he also be able to develop the political skills necessary to contain the resurgent political tendencies within Ugandan society which are working towards a return to traditionalism and a dilution of national identity by a reassertion of tribal or ethnic particularities? Uganda needs a leadership which is capable of combining the skills of both Obote and Amin. It may well be that these types of skills cannot be combined in a single individual. In that case, Uganda may be in for a further political crisis out of which a suitable national political ideology may yet be born.||T. V. Sathyamurthy

This paper attempts to study the logic underlying the economic decision-making of the poor peasant and poor non-peasant category of households in a village in Aligarh district. The authors confirm the essential rationality of the small peasant-cum-multi-occupation household's pattern of activity and observe the crucial role played by the evaluation of the costs of labour power in the household's economic decision-making. The authors also work out evaluations of the costs of labour of the household for different analytical purposes and use the criteria developed for checking the 'viability' and 'efficiency' of these small peasant household's activities. The analysis is specially worked out with a view to understanding the working of the small peasant-cum-multi-occupational household which operates under conditions where its total returns is less than its simple reproductive cost of labour power for its annual production programme.

08/4/1972- ||special articles||4361227||Indo-Bangladesh Trade: Problems and Prospects||The prospects of Indo-Bangladesh trade are circumscribed by two opposite sets of forces. Some, like the locational advantages, the political co-ordination between the two governments, the possibilities of economic co-operation, and the current ban by Bangladesh on trade with West Pakistan, tend to brighten prospects of mutually profitable trade between India and Bangladesh. However, there are other factors that considerably limit the possibilities of such trade. The structural and policy changes in the two countries over the past two decades of Indo-Pak hostilities have replaced the earlier patter of complementarity by a competitive relationship between the two economies. Further, Bangladesh's exports to India are not likely to substitute commodities previously exported by East Pakistan, and there therefore remain for Bangladesh the possible dangers of a diversion of exports away from third markets; and, since trade between India and Bangladesh would be financed by rupees, such trade diversion, re-export, or export of import-substitutes would amount to an increase in the foreign exchange liability of the country exporting them. It is in the long-term interests of both trade partners that possible misunderstandings should be avoided on the 'grant' component of the trade relations between them. Exchanges between the two countries are likely to be influenced by large-scale 'smuggling' across the frontier and by possible disputes on different issues such as transit trade, fiscal allocations, quota provisions, or financing methods for trade. Here, the two decades of Indo-Pak trade disputes could provide useful lessons for policy-makers in both India and Bangladesh. The contents of such policies would be crucial to determining both the overall 'trade-bias' and the net implications of such bias for the trade between the two countries.||Sunanda Sen

That the Congress has put power interests above the clarity of its economic goals is not surprising; few centrist political organisations in democratic societies do. Like the leadership of dominant political organisations in other complex societies, the Congress leadership has attempted to blur class differences rather than accentuate them. That is not to say that Congress policies do not serve some groups' interests more than others, but the 'genius' of Congress activity in Maharashtra has resided in its ability to turn the party into an arena for the reconciliation of quarrels, at least among those groups who have a substantial stake in the way society is being run.||Donald B.

And yet in the light of India's past experience and current political realities major emphasis on ceilings now is not warranted. This is in line with the numerous problems obstructing its implementation, and the fact that what has been so thoroughly scrambled up with impunity cannot be unscrambled, especially at a time when the role played by the big owners in the new technology is deemed paramount in all manner of circles. Apart from all of this, the author's reservations stem from the concern that the stress on ceilings could very well be at the expense of the more immediately promising concentration on the minimum programme of recorded rights of tenants or share-croppers, security of tenure or rights to remain on the land undisturbed, fair land rentals, non-exploitative farm wages, and a considerably enlarged scope of land consolidation.||Wolf Ladejinsky

The success of these efforts would depend on proper planning and identification of suitable institutions and personnel for their execution. A number of these programmes have to be implemented on a 'pilot project basis' and suitable changes could be made in the light of the experience gained in their operation.||R. D. Deshpande

15/4/1972- ||special articles||4361253||The 1972 Election in West Bengal||The spectacular victory of Congress in the 1972 election in West Bengal has come as a big surprise to many. Although many observers probably expected a Congress victory - because of Bangladesh and other factors - the result was anticipated to be a close one, particularly because this time CPI(M) was contesting in alliance with almost all the Left-wing parties in the state. That the number of seats won by CPI(M) should crash from 113 in 1971 to 14 in the recent election was totally unexpected, as was the Congress party's tally of 216 seats. Here the author examines the various theories which have been advanced to explain the startling results of the 1972 election in West Bengal. A detailed, quantitative analysis will follow later.||Biplab Dasgupta

This essay argues that the critical path both for quantitative expansion at the primary level and for qualitative reform in the universities lies through an egalitarian social transformation.||Satish Saberwal

In the circumstances, it has been difficult to achieve a consensus in discussions on the trends in disparities in personal income distribution. Earlier estimates of personal income distribution have been based, however, on purely graphical, and therefore subjective, techniques of integrating the size distribution of consumer expenditure (obtained from NSS) and the size distribution of income before tax (obtained from income-tax data), on very simplifying assumptions. In this paper, following a method used by Ahmed in 1971, an attempt is made to apply the techniques of integration more rigorously, eliminating the subjective element as far as possible. The findings are interesting in the context of other contemporary studies of income disparities, in that, the estimated distribution of per capita personal income at current prices arrived at here show a clear decline in disparities between 1956-57 and 1963-64.||Mahfooz Ahmed,Nikhilesh Bhattacharya

22/4/1972- ||special article||4361279||Working Capital Finance: Criteria of Appraisal||Banks, while providing short-term finance, concentrate their attention on adequacy of security and repayment capacity. Once these two criteria are met, banks do not generally carry out any detailed appraisal of the working of the concerns. Apart from the fact that it leads quite often to double financing, this practice has several other drawbacks. There is no attempt to examine the productive efficiency of an enterprise nor is there any attempt to scrutinise the allocation of available funds by the enterprise for a variety of purposes. As a result, banks play no role in promoting industrial efficiency or rational allocation of resources. This paper seeks to present, in broad outline, a method of appraising working capital finance applications of large manufacturing concerns. Similar methods need to be devised for other sectors such as agriculture, trade, etc.||V. V. Bhatt

25/3/1972- ||review of agriculture, march 1972||4361171||Agricultural Wages, Production and the High-Yielding Varieties||With the dramatic increases in agricultural production in certain regions following the use of high-yielding varieties, interest has focused on the fortunes of agricultural labourers. On the one hand, there has been concern that the rising wages of agricultural labourers in certain areas may reflect an increasing scarcity of labour, entailing mechanisation of operations. On the other hand, there is the feeling that agricultural labourers have not received their due share in the benefits of the new technology, i e, that wages have tended to stay constant despite the rising productivity. This paper examines the available agricultural wage data in order to find out whether wages have been constant in the past and whether the new high-yielding varieties have had any discernible impact on them. It seems clear from the analysis that, in most parts of India, increases in the demand for labour are not accompanied by increases in agricultural wages. It may be that the supply curve of labour is perfectly elastic near the region of its intersection with the demand curve, so that an outward shift of the demand curve (as a result of the new technology which is more labour-intensive) has no apparent impact on wages but merely increases employment. However, in some regions, most notably Punjab, Kerala and possibly Tamil Nadu, the labour market appears to be different. The labour supply curve near the point of intersection with the demand curve is not perfectly elastic. Consequently, introduction of HYV has been accompanied by a significant increase in agricultural wages. These areas have also been the most rapid in accepting the HYV. This fact, of coincidence between most rapid adoption of HYV and a labour supply that is not perfectly elastic, may be significant and calls for further inquiry. It may be that some common factor - most likely rapid economic growth - has had the effect of pushing the demand for labour beyond the perfectly elastic portion of the supply curve.

22/4/1972- ||special article||4361280||New Pattern in Peru: Advancing the Mode of Exploitation||The military junta which took over power in Peru in 1968 has taken a number of dramatic measures including the nationalisation of the US-owned International Petroleum Company and the promulgation of the Agrarian Reform Law. Fidel Castro has gone to the extent of saying about the Peruvian regime: "It matters little that those who started the revolution are a group of army leaders, many of them trained in the United States. If this revolution defends the interests of the people of Peru, if it continues to be anti-imperialist, then it shall have our unqualified support." These are among the factors which have caused a good deal of confusion as to the nature of the regime. In fact, the 'revolutionary' measures carried out by the junta are tending to develop a new mode of operation within the imperialist system and creating an economic structure that will be dependent in a new way. Such dependency will doubtless be less offensive to the nationalist sensibilities of the intermediate sectors of Peruvian society, but will, at the same time, promote a more complex and entrenched form of exploitation.||Lajpat Rai

But at the same time we are living in a world in which the capitalist nations are divided into the developed few and the underdeveloped many. Is this simply the reflection of the uneven spread of capitalist growth, so that with time the benefits will spread to all underdeveloped countries? Or can it be that the process of capitalist growth in the metropolitan countries, apart from imposing deadweight losses on the colonial peoples, was essentially a zero-sum game, so that some countries had to stay underdeveloped if metropolitan countries had to grow along the capitalist path?||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

Indeed, joint sector enterprises may be permitted in all industries which are not reserved exclusively for the State or the small-scale sector, and the sector can be defined without modifying the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956. The paper also recommends various financial and organisational arrangements for making the joint sector experiment successful. The paper is divided into eight sections. The background and scope of the study are discussed in Section I. Section II traces the evolution of the concept and analyses the experience of the country in respect of existing joint sector enterprises. Sections III to VII are devoted to the different issues pertaining to the joint sector. A summary of the recommendations is given in Section VIII.

While the people of Vietnam were fighting a life and death struggle against the brutalities perpetrated by the US Administration, lavish banquests were spread before the arch perpetrator in Moscow and Peking. In Peking, while a band played 'America the Beautiful', Nixon and Chou roamed from table to table drinking toasts to friendship in the Chinese national drink, mao-tai. In his formal toast Nixon called upon the Chinese leaders to join him in a "long march together". The extravaganza produced in Moscow yielded even greater results for Nixon than the Peking political operetta. In record time, nine agreements covering earth, air and space were signed between Nixon and the Soviet Communist Party chief. The Soviet mass media were pressed into service in an unprecedented way to carry the 'message of peace' from the man who had escalated the war in Indochina. History will never absolve these traders in the blood of the peoples of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.||Lajpat Rai

29/4/1972- ||special articles||4361309||India's Sugar Exports: Re-Assessment of Rationale||India first undertook sugar exports in 1957. From the latter half of 1961, government has been sharing the rupee losses on account of sugar exports. Over the years 1961-62 to 1967-68, these subsidies for sugar export amounted to as much as 60 per cent of the foreign exchange earned thereby. And in certain years - 1962-63, 1965-66 and 1966-67 - thesubsidies either equalled or substantially exceeded the exchange earnings from sugar. The fact is that we clearly do not have a comparative costs advantage in sugar. The cost structure of the industry is far too high to warrant export - without losses being incurred by the industry or without official subsidy. And the extent of reorganisation of cane and sugar production that would be required for Indian sugar to become significantly cheaper puts viable sugar exports beyond the pale of the practically possible. Moreover, the developed countries have in sugar-beet a perfect substitute for sugarcane which they, therefore, try to protect. Sugar also has a low income elasticity in the affluent sugar-importing countries. Although all these adverse factors exports of sugar continue to be susidised, reflecting our misplaced investment decisions flowing from the ill-conceived notion that exports have to be promoted at any price.

(b) Mortality for age group 0-4 is less than what is observable elsewhere for the same longevity. (c) Mortality of age group 0-4 is also relatively less subject to improvement. (d) Impact of good or bad times in India was seen on the age group 10-29 years. (e) The pattern of improvement during 1951-61 shakes the earlier pattern of mortality to conform slightly with what one sees elsewhere in the age group 10-29.

25/11/1972- ||special articles||4362067||Tribal Revolt in Parvatipuram Agency||This paper discusses the tribal revolt in the Parvatipuram agency of Srikakulam district in Andhra Pradesh. Members of a social system may perceive discontentment and frustration as a problem, but may not be able to resolve it for lack of internal leadership. In such a situation, leaders from outside the system may step in and direct the surging masses. In Parvatipuram, V Satyanarayana, a non-tribal, was able to provide leadership to the tribals in their struggle against landlord-bourgeois exploitation by totally identifying himself with the tribals. The government is likely to treat the Parvatipuram revolt as a closed chapter, going by the temporary lull in the revolutionary activity after the killing of Satyanarayana and his close associate, A Kailasam, by the police. But so long as the tribals are alienated from land and subjected to virtual slavery the powdered keg of revolt can be set ablaze at any time.||N. Y. Naidu

Thus by the very nature of the problem, it is the structure of the growth and not merely the rate of growth which gains importance. Once the competitive assumption, which is particularly untenable in the context of the initial inequalities that characterise a dual economy, is given up, there is particular need to decompose the aggregates into analytically meaningful categories so that while permitting some observations concerning the aggregates, they also allow explicit consideration of the more important structural properties of the development process. Precisely because different modes of production in their varying stages of evolution are co-existing and interacting, one cannot talk of the development process of a dual economy irrespective of its historico-specific location in space and time. At any point of time we have to look for appropriate categories to describe the institutional setting in a developing economy. It is thus through combing the logical deduction method and historical analysis that the actual process of development has to be viewed. With this approach to the analysis of the process of development, we move away from the usual 'completely interdependent systems' (of the Walrasian type) that have allowed economists to focus on questions of logical consistency, existence and stability of equilibrium and the like. This short paper is a small step towards a framework to describe the process of development in post-Independence India. The empirical part of it is only indicative and observations concerning the course of development are merely illustrative of the use such a framework may have. [These notes are taken from a larger study "On Aspects of the Growth Process of a Dual Economy" submitted to the Department of Economics, University of Bombay. I am grateful to N K Chandra for comments on this paper and to Ashok Rudra and C Feinstein for comments on an earlier draft.]||Krishna Bharadwaj
