This paper addresses the issue of valuation of work, a crucial element in the presentation of evaluative indices. On the basis of a field study of the time use of individuals in rural households, it raises the question whether time itself may not be a more appropriate measure for evaluating work, especially in the context of assetless women workers.||Devaki Jain

Is a new one emerging? Are the seeds being sown within the spectrum of forces converging behind the recent struggles for democratisation? In many countries the traditional Left has become almost irrelevant, and new groups are emerging. While the present study is part of a larger effort to compare over time the importance of democratisation for renewal-oriented popular movements in two such countries (the comparatively liberal Philippines and the authoritarian Indonesia), the focus in this paper is on a third and different case: the Indian state of Kerala. In Kerala, much to everybody's surprise, economic and political problems produced a fresh attempt in the mid-1980s within the powerful Left Front to introduce elements of a new democratic development Project in partial co-operation with popular movements. After discussing the rise and fall of the old Project, this essay analyses the attempts to renew it by following over time when and how reformists have found politics of democratisation instrumental and how the politics have varied with the actual conditions as well as with their own reading of the basic forces at work. Elements of an exciting new project gained ground in the late 1980s and early 1990s but failed to take root. The democratic politicisation of grass roots development activism in the framework of many new and various interests, conflicts and movements turned into a major problem. This neither made full sense to the radical political institutions, movements and processes which had taken shape during the earlier struggles for national independence and state-led development, nor seemed possible for the new movements themselves to come to grips with.

Secondly, in the provision of public health care infrastructure, the state ranks among the better provided states of India. However, there are inter-district variations in the provision of public health care facilities. This paper examines the gender bias and levels in women's health care by taking such districts in the state which are the representative of low provision of health care infrastructure and high level of economic development on one side, and on the other, districts which are economically backward but the provision of public health care infrastructure is maximum.||Rajeshwari

However, once the chief election commissioner is reduced to the position of one among equals and is denied any special power or authority, those dangers become very real. What the ordinance (act) did was to marry the collegiate principle to the existing provisions of Article 324, thus accentuating the weaknesses inherent in those provisions. It is that ordinance (act) which the judgment has upheld in full; and that judgment is now the law of the land and we have to live with it. However, if we accept a collegiate system, it is necessary to eliminate or at least mitigate the dangers implicit in the existing provisions of Article 324.||Ramaswamy R. Iyer

There are many ways in which foreign inflows impinge on savings. If they raise the rate of growth then savings do tend to be higher in periods of rapid growth. But in order to prevent an unsustainable accumulation of debt, it is essential to maintain high incentives for savings and investment, and provide new instruments for both. In the presence of the latter, mobility between income groups augurs well for a future rise in the Indian aggregate savings ratio.||Ashima Goyal

And once gender polarities are reduced, traditional sex and gender differences can be broken down. What androgyny obscures, however, is the social context - it is as if individuals can effortlessly balance traits and behaviour in a social vacuum. The greater individual freedom in certain directions promised by the construct is of little help, therefore, in dealing with deep-seated structural gender inequalities.||Maithreyi Krishnaraj

10/8/1996- ||special articles||4404497||Remembered Villages: Representation of Hindu-Bengali Memories in the Aftermath of the Partition||This paper discusses a set of essays first serialised in the Bengali newspaper Jugantar from 1950 on and later collected together in 1975 in a book called Chhere Asha Gram ('The Abandoned Village'). Written in the aftermath of the partition, these essays capture the sense of tragedy that the division of the country represented to the authors. There are two aspects to this memory: the sentiment of nostalgia and the sense of trauma, and their contradictory relationship to the question of the past. A traumatised memory has a narrative structure which works on a principle opposite to that of any historical narrative. At the same time, however, this memory, in order to be the memory of a trauma, has to place the Event within a past that gives force to the claim of the victim. The native village is pictured as both scared and beautiful, and it is this that makes communal violence an act of both violation and defilement, an act of sacrilege against everything that stood for sanctity and beauty in the Hindu-Bengali understanding of what home was. Muslims are mentioned in these essays; indeed their depiction is critical to the depiction of an idyll, but their 'traditions' are not part of the sacred or of the beautiful.||Dipesh Chakrabarty

What liberalisation has done is to unleash a consumption boom, fuelled by a surge in consumer credit that has accompanied financial sector reform. Such a boom not only increases balance of payments vulnerability, but also offers, in terms of markets, only a once-for all boost that would exhaust itself unless some other stimuli ensure expansion of the home market for manufacturers.||C.

Driven by obsessive fears of the spread of Soviet and Chinese military power and sponsored domestic revolution, the US leadership made anti-communism the virtually exclusive criterion for determining a country's political value to US strategic interests. It ignored regional socio-historical realities of anti-colonialist nationalism and communalism and got enmeshed in the region's internal affairs as a partisan player. But succumbing, even in the post-cold war period, to the various parochial interests that profit from a perpetuation of the cold war subculture weakens America's chances of helping peace, prosperity and political stability in south Asia.||Harold A.

Second, despite constitutional mandates, in an overwhelming number of cases, national and regional interests violate the interests of politically and economically weaker groups and individuals.

For instance, more R and D is conducted in business enterprises than in public R and D institutes and universities; and R and D projects are assessed in terms of their potential economic returns rather than on 'non-instrumental' criteria. R and D is much more than the generation of new products and processes. It is also a potent mechanism for exploiting and assimilating external knowledge. As a technological learning device, it enables firms to keep track of developments within an industry, and hence allows them to retain their core competencies. During periods of technological discontinuities, R and D enables firms to 'leapfrog' into new technological paradigms. This broader view of R and D has numerous organisational and policy implications.||Steve Onyeiwu

Mega City Programme and Efficiency and Equity in Indian Urbanisation||The first major urban policy initiative announced after the government of India began the economic liberalisation process was the Mega City programme, directed by the ministry of urban affairs and employment. It is an attempt to shore up infrastructure in five of the six largest metropolitan regions in India (Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Hyderabad and Bangalore), using innovative financing mechanisms, and emphasising cost recovery. After detailing the political-economic background, the programme and its implementation, three critical questions are considered: one, is the amount of money being invested too little, and has it come too late to turn the situation around? Two, is the programme being targeted to the wrong cities? And, three, will the elite continue to remain beneficiaries, and the urban poor neglected? The answers to these questions raise doubts about the Mega City programme. Since the reforms will have to succeed in the cities (if they are to be durable), urban development policies must be considered with a view to sustaining efficient and, specially, equitable urbanisation patterns.||Sanjoy Chakravorty

In addition, the old issues of land distribution and provision of universal primary education and health must be put back on the agenda. But, more than anything else, it must be recognised that a reforms strategy which aims to withdraw the state from investment, liberalise finance and thus divert finances from the state to the private sector, liberalise agricultural trade and thus enrich the rich at the direct cost of the poor and seeks to control inflation and balance of payments problems through deflation and devaluation is at its root a fundamentally inequitous adventure.||Abhijit Sen

First, we have adopted an essentially mimetic approach to the modernisation of the financial sector, attempting to transpose institutions and instruments from the western developed countries irrespective of their relevance to the contemporary Indian situation. The result has been that on the one hand what we have are 'ghosts' of these institutions and on the other the exaggerated importance given to developing them has meant putting the core issues of the financial sector on the back-burner. The second notable feature of the financial sector reforms has been the government's new-found total faith in the market. To be broadly guided by market signals is one thing; to blindly depend on market forces, irrespective of the macro-economic implications of such dependence, is quite another.||N. A. Mujumdar

Curiously, this absence in the official nationalist archive is reproduced by the radical historiography of our times, which - like the Congress nationalists it sets itself in opposition to - has had scarcely a word to say about tribals, this in contrast to the dozens of exegeses, scholarly and polemical, it has provided on the prehistory of the communal question, the caste question, or the women's question. In addressing this neglect, the present essay approaches the tribal question in colonial India through the work and writings of Verrier Elwin. By 1940 or thereabouts, Elwin had become the most important single influence through whom urban Indians had got to know of their tribal countrymen: their culture, their way of life, their poverty and their vulnerability. His work for the tribes was widely known and widely discussed, fervently praised as well as vehemently attacked. This essay outlines Elwin's invention of the aboriginal and his forgotten but not necessarily irrelevant debates with social workers, anthropologists and missionaries working on or with adivasis.||Ramachandra Guha

Deep class/caste divisions have been barriers to the development of a national drive for mass education by those who have made it to the upper strata. As the economy opens and employment opportunities grow with the expansion of the country's consumer industries, the governing middle class may recognise that the country needs a more literate population and therefore must invest in its children. But it will take a major coalition of locally based groups, the active participation of the media, the contribution of researchers and the information they disseminate, the support of investors, educators, social activists and trade unions and international donor agencies to get India to address the way it treats the children of the poor.||Myron Weiner

A direct assault on avoidance/evasion is difficult within the institutional constraints and information vacuum confronted by tax administration authorities in developing countries. The MAT floor also reduces the distortionary impact of the concessional provisions presently available, and thus partially restores fiscal neutrality with respect to the investment decision. Most of all, a MAT introduces incentives for improved efficiency in the utilisation of existing capacities, which is urgently needed, given the evidence on the decline in this efficiency in recent years in India. On the basis of actual rates of return on corporate assets from a CMIE sample of companies, this paper prescribes a 1.6 per cent levy on total assets, obtained from application of a 40 per cent nominal tax rate (excluding surcharge) to a minimum presumed rate of return to total assets of 4 per cent. The paper also examines the historical transition probabilities of Indian companies around the chosen threshold rate of return.||Indira Rajaraman,T. Koshy

The assumptions on which it is based have also been much criticised. This paper presents an altogether different argument, which is relevant in the context of an underdeveloped agrarian economy like India and which turns on the fact that agriculture has very specific characteristics different from industrial activities, to show why alignment with world prices is likely to be a patently inoptimal policy for such an economy.||Prabhat Patnaik

Contemporary social science displays many of the tensions between specialisation and efforts at integration, between borrowing from other disciplines and 'sticking to one's last', and between recognition of the specific disciplinary demands of cognate fields and the overweening ambition to impose one specific method on the discussion of all questions in social science disciplines. This paper aims to illustrate how seeking answers to certain questions leads to poaching on the territory of other disciplines and how at the same time it is important to recognise the power of certain discipline-specific methods in getting answers to discipline-straddling questions.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

(2) What are the implications of the oft-repeated assertion that there is a disjunction in Indian politics between the social reality and the nature of political power? While remaining supportive of the struggle of the hitherto excluded social groups to press their rightful claim to power, the author examines what are the outside limits of this process. What are the gains for the people if the disjunction is overcome? And for democracy and the polity sustained by it?||Javeed Alam

18/5/1996- ||special articles||4404147||Political Economy of Electric Power in India||Since the cancellation of the Dabhol Power Project (DPP), the debate about electric power in India has come into the public view, raising hopes that corrective measures can be taken to have a viable, cost effective and growing power industry. A critical examination of the recent policy changes especially as regards the Independent Power Projects (IPPs) reveals that there are many dysfunctionalities in this policy particularly in the enormous and quite unnecessary burden it places on the balance of payments, and in the additional constraints against improvement and change in the state sector. It would be damaging to indigenous power equipment manufacturers, particularly the BHEL, just when it is showing the potential to be an important international player in the industry. Moreover the policy is fundamentally flawed in not recognising that bulk purchase of power (for base load) by a utility necessarily acts against the interest of the utility (except in the case where the utility's cost of power generation from its new base unit is higher than for an IPP). If the policy is truly amended to avoid a bias in favour of the IPPs, little of the planned investments, especially from the foreign sector, would materialise. That there are significant social gains in having power generation (and not just distribution) in large integrated firms has been little appreciated. Several constraints to the healthy growth of the sector that had been building up are uncovered in this paper: the inability of the state sector to discipline its management and workforce, large-scale corruption and leakages, load and system imbalances brought about by inadequate investments in distribution systems, and in hydel capacities. The bulk industrial consumers being increasingly left to fend for themselves through captive power generation, as also the political inability to raise the price of power for the household and the agricultural sectors have further contributed to the structural weakness of the SEB system. In the 1990s these have acted to result in a dangerously slow growth in addition to capacities. The problem was compounded by the severe resources 'constraint' of the state. The vicious circle that exists today can be broken only if the government gives up its monetarist blinkers and realises that investments can in part 'create' savings, especially in a sector like power where the marginal product of power is far more than the cost of generation. Large under-utilised capacities in the equipment sector further add to the savings potential. Central contributions to the SEBs need to be linked to their efficiency, and to the resources they are able to generate. Only then would there be pressure to change for the better. Sections I to VI of the paper discuss the recent policy changes, bringing out the dysfunctionalities therein, and present a national alternative. Sections VII to X discuss the key aspects of the problem of the states sector and Section XI sets out the immediate actions in moving towards a healthy electric power system. The paper is published in two parts. Sections I to VI (Part I) appear below and Sections VII to XI (Part II) will be published next week.||Sebastian Morris

This is particularly so for the rural sector, and is the justification for the limited focus in this paper to panchayats alone. But if the intention is improved delivery, the need for additional revenues is even greater. A flat share of aggregate state revenues for local bodies, although an attractively simple solution and in line with the recommendations of the Tenth Finance Commission on centre-state sharing, focuses attention away from the revenue additionality that is critically required for this experiment in decentralised governance to succeed. A taxwise identification on the other hand of state-level taxes to the proceeds of which panchayats have a natural right, whether or not that right is sanctioned under present legislation, enables a focused investigation of ways by which panchayat resources may be augmented. With the assignment to panchayats of revenues that are theirs by right, the need for fiscal equalisation handouts, and indeed the very definition of certain areas as backward, is called into question. The paper also examines taxes presently leviable by panchayats, for ways by which to improve their buoyancy.||Indira Rajaraman,O. P. Bohra,V. S. Renganathan

Contemporary economists seem to take the view that either the debate is trivial or that methodological individualism is obviously right. This complacency has been shaken and interest in this subject has recently been revived by the publication of some new books and papers. This essay examines the new debate, argues that mainstream economists, knowingly or unknowingly, do use concepts which are irreducibly social and defends a particular aspect of individualism. The paper ends by drawing attention to a paradoxical observation concerning normative judgments and methodological individualism.||Kaushik Basu

Revival of industry, strong export growth and gradually declining inflation are pointers that the fundamentals of the economy are right. Revival of the economy has also brought to the fore some predictable problems like the widening trade gap with which the economy will have to live for some years. Questions of short-term management of the economy also have come up, perhaps sooner than expected. Policy-makers will have to learn to anticipate these and be ready with alternative strategies. But before this is done there must emerge a clear understanding among different institutions dealing with policy on how to co-ordinate strategies and on the quantum and mode of policy intervention. Finally, delaying further reforms that are needed may prove harmful insofar as that gives the wrong signals and creates avoidable uncertainties.||K. Krishnamurty,V. Pandit,T. Palanivel,P. Saibaba,D.

Such study offers two major advantages; (a) the juvenile sex ratios (JSRs) are not affected by migration and therefore, (b) their analysis provides useful insights into patterns of differential mortality among children by sex. A disaggregation of these sex ratios into the 0-4 and 5-9 age groups brings into sharper focus the pattern of excess female mortality beyond the age of one year. This is a socially driven phenomenon as against excess infant male mortality which is essentially a biological phenomenon. The female to male ratio (FMR) in the 5-9 age group emerges as an appropriate parameter for analysis of the sex ratio variations across the country. It reveals significant differences in the sex ratio patterns among three major social groups, viz, the tribal, the scheduled castes and the rest of the population. It displays a remarkable spatial contiguity across different geophysical regions of the country. These regions turn out to be a more suitable unit for analysis of spatial variations in the sex ratios than the administrative units of different Indian states. Certain regions, cutting across the state boundaries, stand out for their alarmingly low FMRs. The observed patterns raise important questions about design of women and child welfare programmes and indicates the need for plurality in their design and for area and group specific interventions.||S.

It is suggested here that there is considerable suffering, limitation of choice and inequality even without waiting for the final, stark outcome of premature death - a dimension which can be captured using anthropometric data. This method allows assessing inequalities within households, and in particular, examining separately the well-being of some of its members (e g, females), and doing so well before death, not only at the overall national level, but also by sub-national regions and ethnic groups.||Anuradha Khati Rajivan

Governments have played a key role in the evolution of the industry in all these countries. South Korea, a relatively late entrant to the automobile industry, has made the most significant progress, and is now exporting cars to developed markets. It is the only country that invested in R and D for product development, retained management control in joint ventures with multinational companies (MNCs), and had ambitious export targets. The industry in Brazil is older than that in South Korea, but indigenous product development capabilities are lacking and manufacturing competitiveness is limited even though the industry is entirely controlled by MNCs. The Indian industry is experiencing a revolution with rapid growth and the entry of the largest number of MNCs. The Chinese industry is also growing very rapidly although it is still highly fragmented. We trace the evolution of the industry in these growing markets and explore the linkages between government policy, the degree of managerial control and indigenous capabilities and competitiveness.||Avinandan Mukherjee,Trilochan Sastry

Increasingly, the traditional policy prescription for centralised, bureaucratic control in allocating water is being challenged and new approaches in water allocation are emerging which go beyond technological innovations to look at the incentives each provides for water conservation.

The implication of a non-expansionary devaluation is that in such cases not only are complementary contractionary monetary and fiscal policies unnecessary for making the devaluation 'stick', they may actually prove to be undesirable in the sense that investments even in the traded goods sector may get retarded and thus delay the process of moving to a new and more export-oriented economic structure. Unfortunately, these studies have had virtually no effect on the 'conditionalities' imposed by the Fund-Bank establishment and contractionary policies continue to be routinely prescribed along with somewhat less controversial 'exchange rate adjustments'. In a seminal contribution. Richard Cooper first pointed out that a devaluation from an initial position of deficit is likely to be contractionary simply as a consequence of the initial trade 'disequilibrium' and no other precondition is necessary. Unfortunately, though Cooper's 'trade balance effect' has been incorporated in a number of pedagogic models of stabilisation, it has not been subjected to critical appraisal. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate in a simple macroeconomic model that although Cooper's hypothesis is valid insofar as the postulated contractionary outcome is concerned, neither his theoretical arguments nor his empirical assessments are entirely correct. An attempt is also made to derive the necessary conditions under which the 'trade balance effect' may reasonably be expected to occur, so that these conditions are not excluded from policy models by a priori assumptions.||Pronab Sen

This coming together led to the birth of the Safdar Hashmi Memorial Trust, Sahmat, with the objectives of defending the right to freedom of expression and dissent, forging closer ties among artists and intellectuals from all over the country, building links between artists and the people and evolving genuinely democratic, progressive and people-oriented forms of cultural articulation. In the last five years or so, however, Sahmat has chosen to become a single issue platform.

First, part of the rise in saving represents rise in speculative inventory holding and so cannot be said to reflect improved health of the economy and buoyancy of investment. Second, a significant part of the higher saving represents saving out of the sharply increased remittances from Indian workers from abroad in 1994-95.

Paralleling the controversy in England, the Indian situation saw a ranging of participants on political as well as theoretical lines. Against a historical overview of the economic situation in England leading up to the bullionist controversy, this paper surveys the different arguments and attempts to classify the diverse strands into four well defined, theoretically distinct positions.

25/5/1996- ||special articles||4404185||Political Economy of Electric Power in India||Since the cancellation of the Dabhol Power Project (DPP), the debate about electric power in India has come into the public view, raising hopes that corrective measures can be taken to have a viable, cost effective and growing power industry. A critical examination of the recent policy changes especially as regards the Independent Power Projects (IPPs) reveals that there are many dysfunctionalities in this policy particularly in the enormous and quite unnecessary burden it places on the balance of payments, and in the additional constraints against improvement and change in the state sector. It would be damaging to indigenous power equipment manufacturers, particularly the BHEL, just when it is showing the potential to be an important international player in the industry. Moreover, the policy is fundamentally flawed in not recognising that bulk purchase of power (for base load) by a utility necessarily acts against the interest of the utility (except in the case where the utility's cost of power generation from its new base unit is higher than for an IPP). If the policy is truly amended to avoid a bias in favour of the IPPs, little of the planned investments, especially from the foreign sector, would materialise. That there are significant social gains in having power generation (and not just distribution) in large integrated firms has been little appreciated. Several constraints to the healthy growth of the sector that had been building up are uncovered in this paper: the inability of the state sector to discipline its management and workforce, large-scale corruption and leakages, load and system imbalances brought about by inadequate investments in distribution systems, and in hydel capacities. The bulk industrial consumers being increasingly left to fend for themselves through captive power generation, as also the political inability to raise the price of power for the household and the agricultural sectors have further contributed to the structural weakness of the SEB system. In the 1990s these have acted to result in a dangerously slow growth in the addition to capacities. The problem was compounded by the severe resources 'constraint' of the state. The vicious circle that exists today can be broken only if the government gives up its monetarist blinkers and realises that investments can in part 'create' savings, especially in a sector like power where the marginal product of power is far more than the cost of generation. Large under-utilised capacities in the equipment sector further add to the savings potential. Central contributions to the SEBs need to be linked to their efficiency, and to the resources they are able to generate. Only then would there be pressure to change for the better. Sections I to VI of the paper discuss the recent policy changes, bringing out the dysfunctionalities therein, and present a national alternative. Sections VII to X discuss the key aspects of the problem of the states sector and Section XI sets out the immediate actions in moving towards a healthy electric power system. [The paper is published in two parts. Sections I to VI (Part I) were published last week.]||Sebastian Morris

The supposedly resurgent Communists in Russia marked the occasion in their own way, by beginning a process of rehabilitation of Stalin and denouncing the Congress!||Dev Murarka

Its spread in modern times may be found in political and economic factors. This article examines the history of malaria in India and the policy towards its control in the last hundred years. Against this background it examines the nature and spread of the several epidemics of malaria in Rajasthan, a region which had in the past not experienced such epidemics. The improvement of transport and communication facilities in the region, labour migration from villages in the arid zone, agricultural colonisation consequent upon the opening of the Indira Gandhi Canal and the change in the size and composition of the livestock be among the major causes for the changing disease pattern in the state. Any policy for controlling the disease needs to take cognisance of these factors.||Kashyap Mankodi

Productivity is measured using a linear-programming based technique called data envelopment analysis. The results show that in the decade of the 1950s, industrial efficiency was relatively high; however, in the 1960s and 1970s there was severe retrogression in efficiency patterns. These patterns began reversing themselves only in the 1980s; while efficiency in the 1980s was no better than it had been in the 1950s, data indicate that Indian industry has reached its highest efficiency potential throughout the 1990s thus providing some evidence that the reforms seem to be working.||Sumit K.

While extensive legislation exists which could permit the effective role of local government in development, severe financial constraints faced by these governments have meant that they are no longer involved in the process of development. Unless substantial structural measures are taken, in which the role of local government is redefined, it is unlikely that development at the local level will take place.||S. Akbar Zaidi

They argue that there is no need to have a poverty line to measure the degree of poverty of any community or group of vulnerable households. The method developed here reveals that cereals constitute the commodity group that occupies the top position in the hierarchy of needs, both in rural and urban areas. Next item of priority, both for rural and urban areas, is fuel and light and not clothing partly because one cannot make a 'roti' out of wheat without the cooking fuel.||V. Sitaramam,S. A.

Is a new one emerging? Are the seeds being sown within the spectrum of forces converging behind the recent struggles for democratisation? In many countries the traditional Left has become almost irrelevant, and new groups are emerging. While the present study is part of a larger effort to compare over time the importance of democratisation for renewal-oriented popular movements in two such countries (the comparatively liberal Philippines and the authoritarian Indonesia), the focus in this paper is on a third and different case: the Indian state of Kerala. In Kerala, much to everybody's surprise, economic and political problems produced a fresh attempt in the mid-1980s within the powerful Left Front to introduce elements of a new democratic development Project in partial co-operation with popular movements. After discussing the rise and fall of the old Project, this essay analyses the attempts to renew it by following over time when and how reformists have found politics of democratisation instrumental and how the politics have varied with the actual conditions as well as with their own reading of the basic forces at work. Elements of an exciting new Project gained ground in the late 1980s and early 1990s but failed to take root. The democratic politicisation of grass roots development activism in the framework of many new and various interests, conflicts and movements turned into a major problem. This neither made full sense to the radical political institutions, movements and processes which had taken shape during the earlier struggles for national independence and state-led development, nor seemed possible for the new movements themselves to come to grips with.||Olle Tornquist,P.

Their alliance, therefore, is inevitable. In this background, the state politics is likely to witness a two-fold competition: The alliance will try to win over the remaining social base of the Congress. Simultaneously, the alliance partners will be silently engaged in usurping each other's following in a bid to replace the Congress.||Suhas Palshikar

Moreover, enrolments in government-funded schools are greatly over-reported in education data. This article argues that, as a result, official education statistics are seriously skewed: they exaggerate the size of the free, government-funded elementary school sector and greatly understate the size of the private fee-charging elementary school sector. While it may be expedient for the state to exaggerate its own contribution to school education, a system where fee-levying institutions have a significant role in elementary education while secondary education is largely state-supported has perverse equity-effects. The article also presents evidence to show that official enrolment statistics - on which analysts, policy-makers, and international studies rely, and which are used in parliamentary debates - are gravely inaccurate.||Geeta G.

However, discussion of the issue of the competitiveness of Indian agriculture has been carried on in a narrow context, ignoring major questions such as global commodity prospects in terms of prices and their stability/instability and the movement of domestic and world market prices and of agricultural and non-agricultural prices within the country. The overriding issue of the structure of the global market has been hardly brought into the discourse. In this paper an attempt is made to examine competitiveness of some selected agricultural crops in the light of empirical evidence of domestic and international prices, the world commodity situation and the structure of the global market for agricultural commodities.||Sucha Singh Gill,Jaswinder Singh Brar

Until they learn from both their own past and the experience of successful late-industrialisers and piece together their own sensible policies, specifically geared to their current status, their efforts to restructure and to make a transition to a market economy will continue to sputter. This report is a collaborative effort which represents an agreed upon core of analysis that differs sharply and systematically from both the received wisdom of the so-called 'Washington Consensus' and the economic policies of the Russian government in the period from 1990 to 1995. Our goal is to provide a point of departure for an innovative economic policy that can both lift the Russian economy out of its current depressed state and at the same time be socially and politically viable. Only a drastically different approach has any hope of allowing democratically and economically successful renewal to begin from among the ruins created by past policies.||Alice Amsden,Michael Intriligator,Robert McIntyre,Lance Taylor

In India, too, consumer food subsidies have fallen since 1991. The reduction in food subsidies has come about, despite little change in the budgetary allocation to 'food subsidy', by means of sharp price increases for commodities sold in fair-price shops, by a fall in quantities supplied to the system of public distribution, and by a reduction in entitlements in certain cases. In a period of low growth and high inflation, the public distribution system failed to ensure that the prices of major food staples were low and stable.||Madhura Swaminathan

What does it mean for the economy and private corporate sector? It is largely disintermediation: household sector substituted 'shares and debentures' for bank deposits, and corporate sector securitised its debt. There is no association between growth rates of the capital market mobilisation and aggregate saving rate, corporate physical investment and value added. Long-term decline in the contribution of internal finance to corporate fixed investment and in profitability in 1980s are noted, despite a fall in ratio of corporate tax to gross profit. The study concludes by raising some questions.||R. Nagaraj

The elections ushered in a new era in the country's politics, marking the beginning of the third phase in the reconfiguration of the party system. The first phase of the famous 'Congress system', characterised by single-party dominance, lasted the first two decades after independence. The second phase, which may be called the 'Congress-Opposition system', was still characterised by the one-party salience, though no longer dominance, of the Congress. Despite remaining out of power very often, the Congress retained a salience in the party system not only because it continued to command greater popular support than any opposition party, but also because it was the core around which the party system was structured. The third phase, inaugurated by the assembly elections of 1993-95, definitely signals a move towards a competitive multi-party system which can no longer be defined with reference to the Congress. While it may be too early to expect a fully worked out picture of what the post-Congress system would look like, a comparison of the 1993-95 elections with elections in the previous phases of Indian politics brings out some of the enduring structural changes which have redefined the terrain of electoral politics.||Yogendra Yadav

Reforms, in general, were undertaken keeping socialist principles and institutions intact. This paper attempts to provide an overview of the most important political developments in Vietnam since 1986, and examines the role of the party in shaping the perspectives of the state and the private sectors that guarantees social and economic equities. For this analysis, the 8th national party congress, held in June 1996, in Hanoi, is considered as a point of reference. It concludes that the party's hold on the population remains strong, and the current changes in Vietnam will help Hanoi defend its sovereignty, not only economically, but also culturally and politically. It seems possible that Vietnam will develop in tandem with China but with a lesser role for the party in state affairs.||M. S. Shivakumar

While the informal sector provides most of the services, the formal rural financial institutions have inappropriate tools and perspectives in delivering the services.

06/1/1996- ||special articles||4403647||Investment, Exports and Growth: A Cross-Country Analysis||Growth experience across underdeveloped countries indicates that it is really the investment ratio which plays the crucial role in determining the growth rate. The so-called 'efficiency of resource use', over which so much hullabaloo has been raised in recent years, does not, by implication, appear to be a particularly significant factor determining relative growth performance. What is more, even the relative export performance across countries appears to be dependent on the relative investment ratios. One unambiguous conclusion that can be drawn is that in countries such as India which have gone in for liberalisation-cum-structural adjustment on the plea that this would raise the economy's growth rate, no such increase in the growth rate can possibly occur unless the investment ratio is raised substantially. In practice, however, the effect of these policies has been precisely the opposite - a significant reduction in the investment ratio.||Prabhat Patnaik,C. P. Chandrasekhar

The author also argues that the increased amplitude of economic fluctuations is a result of the nature of state intervention under the new economic policies which has reduced policy effectiveness. The government is unable to control or regulate the impact of shocks (external or internal) since it lacks the policy instruments or has given up some of them or they are greatly circumscribed by the requirements of the new policies precisely at a time when the economy has become far more complex and is subject to more external shocks.||Arun Kumar

There are, in fact, two nations in India, separated by an economic gulf. None of the mainstream theories - the orthodox liberal, orthodox Marxist, functionalist, and consociationalist - has addressed this fundamental question which goes far beyond the confines of institutional mechanics or reductionist economism. This paper aims to throw some explanatory light on the implications for the future of the alignment of political forces that may be unfolding in the power vacuum surrounding a weakening central state, and its impact on the 'two nations' in India - the 'nation above' which is rent by horizontal divisions of class, caste, gender, culture, religion and region; and 'the nation below' through which runs a common denominator of dispossession, disinheritance, poverty and marginalisation.||T.

The disaggregated productivity measures are then suitably aggregated to provide a revised index of productivity for Indian manufacturing. The author's scheme of disaggregation divides organised manufacturing into sub-sectors by the criteria of ownership (public versus private) and enterprise size (small versus large). This disaggregation is intended to eliminate some major potential sources of aggregation bias and to shed light on the public/private and small/large dichotomies that have featured among the main lines of the Indian debate concerning industrial performance and policy. Finally, the paper also aims to reconsider the conventional interpretation of total productivity measures in terms of supply-side factors alone.||J. Mohan Rao

This has been interpreted variously. The government of India has rushed to argue that the 'measured' decline might only reflect a methodological practice. On the other hand, critics of the reform process have argued that the decline is not only real but a direct consequence of the strategy adopted which has encouraged increased consumption of durable goods. Both these arguments are considered here and found wanting. On the other hand, the behaviour of the household savings rate since 1991 is relatively well explained by a persistence of consumption in the presence of an unanticipated shock in income. The decline in income is itself not too difficult to explain. It is often overlooked that since 1991 the economy has seen not only reforms but also a conventional stabilisation programme that initially lowers growth.||Pulapre Balakrishnan

Mark-up pricing is shown to be consistent with profit maximisation, and the theoretical hypothesis about pricing behaviour is tested empirically. The issues addressed are important because the mark-up is a major component of the inflationary process. Understanding variations in it will help to understand inflation. Secondly, the mark-up is also the profit share, and as such affects both the savings and investment decisions, and influences medium-run growth or macro-economic activity. An implication for policy, is the possible stagflationary consequences of a demand squeeze, especially a cut in investment. In the absence of a supply shock, inflation is likely to be lower and growth higher when demand for industrial goods is high.||Ashima Goyal

Even to maintain the current level of investment, more and more concessions may be needed. This creates inequity and problems for resource mobilisation which worsen the budgetary position leading to slow-down of public investment and the capacity to fight poverty. Market-based solutions to increase investment activity also cause economic fluctuations to increase, resulting in uncertainty and speculative activity whose victims are the poor. They reduce the degree of freedom of the state governments to operate programmes suited to their needs.||Arun Kumar

In this paper the authors argue that a comparative advantage in manufacturing quality-competitive hand-made shoes can only be achieved if workers are not treated only as a cost but also as an asset. Still, at present most workers in Agra manufacture low quality products under sweat-shop rule. A shift to more quality-competitive production with better employment conditions seems feasible because of, firstly, the present underutilisation of artisanal skills, and, secondly, booming market niches for fashionable artisanal designer shoes. However, such a shift is impeded by caste-based antagonism, omnipresent instability and the use of outdated technologies.||Peter Knorringa

That was when Bali fell victim to the explosion of violence that brought death to between 5,00,000 and a million Indonesians. The number of people killed on the island is uncertain, but it cannot have been far less than 80,000. Within the space of a few weeks, one in every 20 Balinese had been killed. And if the perpetrators are added to the number of their victims, and taking into consideration the many more who were detained secretly and indefinitely, one in every three households became involved in this 'purge' of what was said to be a paradise on earth.

The philosophical underpinnings of the qualitative approach reject the logic of generalisations for human beings at large, suggesting that homogeneity with respect to the purpose at hand is potentially possible only within smaller groups. The qualitative approach provides methods of identifying such groups, constituting a first step towards the formulation of a testable hypothesis or theory. The quantitative approacah would enter the picture here, for providing a framework for testing the intra-group homogeneity and inter-group variation being postulated by the qualitative methods.||Parthasarathi Shome,Carlos J.

However, the contemporary changes overtaking us, disturbing as they are, also harbour the possibility of bringing our political and intellectual engagements on to new and fruitful terrain. For those who have been working at the interface of gender and development, it is time to refigure their priorities, not by secluding themselves within some putative 'pure' economy, but by broadening feminist conceptions of the economy itself. Rescuing the notion of gender from its ritualistic incantations and making it really work for a more emancipatory and inclusive social order is one of the ways open to them, one they have every reason to take.||Mary E.

Is a new one emerging? Are the seeds being sown within the spectrum of forces converging behind the recent struggles for democratisation? In many countries the traditional Left has become almost irrelevant, and new groups are emerging. While the present study is part of a larger effort to compare over time the importance of democratisation for renewal-oriented popular movements in two such countries (the comparatively liberal Philippines and the authoritarian Indonesia), the focus in this paper is on a third and different case: the Indian state of Kerala. In Kerala, much to everybody's surprise, economic and political problems produced a fresh attempt in the mid-1980s within the powerful Left Front to introduce elements of a new democratic development Project in partial co-operation with popular movements. After discussing the rise and fall of the old Project, this essay analyses the attempts to renew it by following over time when and how reformists have found politics of democratisation instrumental and how the politics have varied with the actual conditions as well as with their own reading of the basic forces at work. Elements of an exciting new Project gained ground in the late 1980s and early 1990s but failed to take root. The democratic politicisation of grass roots development activism in the framework of many new and various interests, conflicts and movements turned into a major problem. This neither made full sense to the radical political institutions, movements and processes which had taken shape during the earlier struggles for national independence and state-led development, nor seemed possible for the new movements themselves to come to grips with.

But their writings have often ignored the complexities of the historical formation of the Indian working class and have not dealt with many critical areas and major themes, among them, labour process and labour forms, control over and subordination of labour, leadership patterns at different levels, the relationship between the workplace and the community life outside it and proletarianisation and class formation. Furthermore, larger themes of culture, ideology and mentalities, gender dimension, or protests and deference at the macro as well as micro levels and interrelations between these and the politics involved have been neglected. The task before the labour historian today is to widen our comprehension and deepen our understanding by coming to grips with these themes and issues. The pursuit of that task does in no way require the abandonment of the Marxist perspective. That perspective must be retained. It needs to be supplemented and complemented with new perspectives such as culture linked with material foundations, gender, social identities other than class and environment and ecology.||Ranajit Das Gupta

But neither a technocracy or bureaucracy acting as the arbiter of conflicts nor a free market system which may tilt towards privatisation of open access resources would address ecological issues adequately, whereas the assertion of people's rights has the potential for a different kind of conservation-oriented control of their lives and lands. The question then becomes one of working out a new set of relations with the forest which will be enduring both for the people and the natural world.

In this context it is now essential to confront the implications of environmental degradation. Blind pursuit of growth could damage the environment, but an undue emphasis on the latter could also inhibit growth and reduction of poverty. The thrust of this paper is on gaining a fuller understanding of sustainable development by analysing the relationship between development and the environment at the global and the national level, set in the frame of the shift in emphasis from state to market led development policies. This unfolds the extent to which the development-environment interaction is embodied first in global policies, emanating from conventions and international venues, and secondly, in national policies, on agriculture, industry and trade, to transform the economy. The analysis provides some insights into the process of sustainable development and issues for further research.||Sumit Roy

It then concentrates on examining relationships in the econometric framework during the entire period of analysis. The study has empirically brought out the trade off between the interests of rural poor and the group which is likely to gain from the favourable terms of trade to agriculture. The terms of trade have shown positive tendency to raise output, which in turn has helped in reducing the rural poverty, provided it is captured to indicate the income changes for the agriculture sector. Although the favourable terms of trade facilitated the growth process by increasing the private investment, they adversely affected the rural poor by raising the relative prices of commodities consumed by them.||V.

The Maharashtrian psyche remains captivated by the image of Anandibai as a submissive and obedient girl-wife who fulfilled her husband's visionary ambition for her. However, the series of images sketched by Anandibai's own words produce a self-portrait in which the submissive wife coexists with an intelligent woman dispassionately perceptive of herself and her society.

This article draws attention to the effect the learning environment within the formal educational system has been having on the dalit pupils. It argues that besides poor infrastructural facilities, lack of effective pedagogic supports to acquire linguistic, numerical and cognitive competencies adversely affect the schooling of dalit children. More importantly, despite active encouragement from impoverished family members, the apathetic treatment by teachers and school administrators largely shape the learning experiences of these socially disadvantaged groups. By creating a separate sphere of non-formal education for such groups, the government of late has abdicated its responsibility to generate equity within the formal school system.||Geetha B. Nambissan

This mapping of social context has questioned the 'closed system' approach in organisation behaviour literature. However, organisations are text and they emerge and operate in a context. The context, including state, law and society, are dynamic and interactive social processes. Once an organisation is born, its constitution binds the constituents in its language like law; and it is a social fact re-shaping the context. Therefore an understanding of organisations has to read the text and context as dynamic processes and multiple discourses taking place within and amongst the organisation, society, law and state.||Vikash N.

Hate speech laws address a harm - promotion of hatred towards different racial, caste and religious groups - with which we should be concerned. In stark contrast, sexual speech laws address a harm with which we should not be concerned. The legal regulation of sexual speech is designed to reinforce traditional and highly conservative sexual moralities. Drawing a distinction between hate speech and sexual speech may help to formulate legal and non-legal strategies in response to the specificities of each.||Ratna Kapur

It is the aspect of food security as affected by food availability and income shifts which is the focus of this paper. The paper argues that the undeclared aim of these policies appears to be the restricting of domestic income growth and absorption of the products of developed countries by the populations of developing countries in order to release resources for growth of the exportable products demanded by the developed world. In support of this the paper looks at the international division of labour in agricultural production in a historical perspective and contends that the theory of comparative advantage cannot explain either the history or the pattern of international specialisation because it contains a logical fallacy: relative costs cannot be defined at all for a large range of trade relations. The paper also comments on the new pattern of demands on tropical agriculture emerging in the developed countries and the new drive to obtain tropical importables on favourable terms.||Utsa Patnaik

This is brought home most sharply by the case of the unorganised sector. Countries with a large proportion of the workforce in the unorganised sector have to reckon with the fact that the number of such workers will rise as a consequence of structural adjustment and economic reform. So-called safety nets cannot solve their problems. What is needed is a new approach to development in which petty producers are made agents of social transformation through their own organisations which bring them economies of scale, technology, credit and marketing.||G.

But today things look much less clear - far from the collapse of the old regimes leading to the unleashing of a new dynamism, the region seems trapped in chaos, depression and gloom. Most analysts have been unwilling to try to conceptualise the overall nature of the transition. This paper attempts to do this by overviewing the economic and political developments in the region during the last five years, an exercise that reveals, among other things, the extent to which much of the old order has been able to shift its power base to find niches in the new regimes.||Michael Haynes

There are essentially three main constraints or factors that act against the ability of the state to attract investments, namely, the psychological fear created by militant trade unions, the shortage of land and of electric power. Alive to removing these constraints the government is implementing a number of infrastructural projects essentially to remove the latter two constraints. The response of private sector industry to these initiatives has been moderately satisfactory but the state still attracts only a minute fraction of the total investments in the country as a whole.||Sunil Mani

The results of this exercise show that Indian manufacturing (factory) sector is capital intensive and is operating under decreasing returns to scale. The elasticity of labour productivity is found to be significantly more than unity implying that substitution possibilities in favour of labour are quite high. Therefore there is need to redirect the Indian manufacturing sector towards greater use of labour intensive technology until the marginal productivity of labour is equal to marginal wage rate.||M.

Since about 1987, deregulation and liberalisation eased some of these problems, with the result that average profits and investment rates have improved, though the extent and nature of the revival continue to be influenced by structural constraints such as labour-market segmentation and shortage of resources. The paper reviews the transition and interprets what it might mean for the industry and for industrial growth, in the medium term. The paper concludes that the main positive features of the transition are that, it is intensive in cotton, a fibre in which India has a long-term advantage, it has diversified and strengthened demand for cotton textiles at home, raised prospects for a solution to sickness in older industries and represents the beginning of a growth-trajectory in textiles favourable to a rise in wages and productivity. The main negative aspect, on the other hand, is that the transition is intensive in scarce resources, and therefore, likely to be confined to small segments of the cloth market.||Tirthankar Roy

Based on the framework, the various reforms are classified into categories reflecting their regulatory effectiveness and/or their impact on sources of market failure. The paper arrives at a generally positive assessment of the reforms, but points out three areas of concern: the lack of a fixed term appointment for the regulators: the persistence of non-competitive conditions in the market: and the excessive entry of new scrips into the market, although in recent days, some steps have been taken to address this problem as well.||Subir Gokarn

Analysed here is the distribution of IPS subsidy among IPS users in Maharashtra, the likely impacts of consumption-based tariff and tariff hike. The analysis shows that flat (Hp-based) tariff results in highly skewed subsidy distribution and is regressive in nature. Most farmers can pay tariff much higher than usually assumed to be possible.||Girish Sant,Shantanu Dixit

The vast majority of young people find in the Indian Constitution no guarantee of a right to a reasonably decent life. But the support for ULFA does not mean necessarily support for secession from India. The weakness of the Assamese national base has made it impossible for the ULFA to formulate a programme for national reconstruction. And in the past, it was easy for Congress(I) governments at the centre to find support among the conglomeration of ethnic groups and maintain a semi-Fascist regime by suppressing the Assamese with virtual army rule. Given this, talks initiated by a genuinely democratic government sympathetically aware of the crisis of the Assamese nationality but capable of firmness when it degenerates into chauvinism is the best hope of solution to the problem posed by ULFA.||Hiren Gohain

The current account payments deficit rose in the 1980s because of the steady decline in the surplus on the invisibles account, partly the result of the 'liberalisation' of the 1980s. Equally, the data do not show that exports have picked up and the balance of trade has improved since the initiation of the 'economic reforms' of the 1990s. The index of industrial production shows no sign of acceleration, but inflation has picked up. As a result, in spite of substantial nominal devaluation, the real effective exchange rate has tended to appreciate. All the while there has been the ongoing accumulation of external debt. The debt problem is likely to worsen as production and exports fail to accelerate and imports grow with progressive trade liberalisation.||Prabirjit Sarkar

Beginning with the identification of the poor based on a measure of standard of living and a minimum norm and going up to the final stage of policy prescription, an awareness of the data base and the constraints it imposes on interpretations is crucial. Conventional approaches to poverty identification and measurement presuppose a stationary economy. But in an economy subject to changes in institutional parameters involving increasing commercialisation of product markets and growing casualisation of labour markets, as in India in recent years, the conventional approach can yield misleading results and policy prescriptions.||M.

Against this background, this paper discusses some issues relating to the measurement of domestic saving and capital formation. Further, it contends that the evolving economic structure and policy framework are such that the Indian economy is unlikely to achieve the kind of rapid increases in domestic saving which propelled the remarkable growth of the east and south-east Asian countries.||EPW Research Foundation

In the later years, with the coming of the partition and subsequent migration to India, this sect, confronting a greatly changed social milieu, assumed a somewhat different focus and identity. Despite this shifting of emphasis and consequent contradictions, the core doctrine of celibacy has remained and its advocacy of female sexual control continues to find receptive echoes. The author's analysis highlights the multiplicity of motives, both obscure and apparent, behind the acceptance of the sect in the contemporary period. Faced with yet greater intricacies of socio-economic issues, the central thrust of the sect continues to contribute to its success in breaking out of its high caste and class complexion and in carving out a committed middle class urban following.||Prem Chowdhry

On the one hand, more and more people have chosen extra-parliamentary violent and non-violent channels of political activity and on the other there has been a trend towards coalition politics within the parliamentary system itself. With time these features have become more and more prominent with both extra-parliamentary political activity and coalition politics on the rise. The 1996 parliamentary election results from Madhya Pradesh and the prevailing political scenario in the state, as discussed in this paper, sound a fair warning of this kind of disintegration of the parliamentary system.||Rahul

Marxism has also been forced onto the defensive as an intellectual tradition with the rise of post-structuralism and post-modernism. As a prelude to a discussion of the future of Marxism, one must first consider the causes of its present marginalisation. In this article the author argues that Marxism has not been theoretically refuted but has suffered several serious though not fatal political defeats.

If whole families are being affected, why should there be a need to focus separately on women? A review of existing studies on displacement and rehabilitation reveals little information on the gender dimensions of the problem. Almost all analyses on displacement and policies on relocation assume the household or the family to be the smallest unit of convergent interests where the benefits and burdens of policies are shared by all members. Yet there is evidence today that the burden of change is far greater for women and that they have even less access to the benefits of development than do men.||Enakshi Ganguly Thukral
24/2/1996- ||review of labour, february 1996||4403827||Liberalisation and Industrial Relations||The primary conditions for the creation of international division of labour are the availability of cheap labour, an efficient telecommunication system, a worldwide mobilisation of capital and development of multilateral institutions. The process of liberalisation currently under way is directed at creating these conditions. The restructuring of industry, changes in the business environment and the slackening of labour laws in India have to be seen as part of the effort to put a new international division of labour in place.||Ernesto Noronha

27/7/1996- ||review of political economy, july 1996||4404438||India in the World Economy, 1400-1750||World development between 1400 and 1800 reflects not Asia's weakness but its and particularly China's and India's economic strength and Europe's relative weakness in the global economy. For it was all these regions' joint participation and place in the single but unequally structured and unevenly changing global economy that resulted also in changes in their relative positions in the world. The common global economic expansion since 1400 benefited the Asian centres earlier and more than it did Europe, Africa and the Americas. However, this very economic benefit turned into a growing absolute and relative disadvantage for one Asian region after another in the late 18th century. Production and trade began to atrophy as growing population and income and growing economic and social polarisation exerted pressure on resources, constrained effective demand at the bottom and increased the availability of cheap labour in Asia more than elsewhere in the world. Contrary to Marx and Weber, however, this new European participation in world development was not based on any unique development of 'capitalism' nor on scientific 'revolution' in Europe after the Renaissance and, still less, on any exceptional western 'rationalism' inherited from Judaism or Greece. Instead, some Europeans then managed to climb on the Asian economies' shoulders. The Europeans pursued policies adopted by the latterday Newly Industrialising Economies (NIEs), first of import substitution and then increasingly export promotion to and within the global world market. Europeans innovated labour-saving and power-generating technologies that responded to world economic population/resource relations of demand and supply which began to favour the west over the east.||Andre Gunder Frank

Before issues of interpretation are engaged, these methodological issues need to be clarified and, where possible, the measures recast. The critical issues fall into four broad areas: (1) the method of growth accounting at the aggregate manufacturing (or any other) level; (2) biases imposed by particular methods of aggregation; (3) the econometric identifiability of the production function (at any level of aggregation); and (4) the interpretation of measured productivity growth. The first and third issues are addressed in this paper for the organised sector of Indian manufacturing. Problems of aggregation and interpretation will be taken up separately in a companion article.||J. Mohan Rao

Stock markets are booming; corporate profits are at an all-time high. But wages are falling; job insecurity is pervasive; and social tensions are mounting. Our paradigm uses the non-linear Polya process to represent the ongoing increasing returns, in contrast to the traditional idea of diminishing returns. It is a world of multiple equilibria, instability, unpredictability, and the possibility of getting locked-in to an inferior equilibrium. In this milieu we portray the current scene as one of contradictions between 'industry' and 'finance': the former presses for output growth, the latter insists on zero-inflation. Evidently, labour is the worst loser in this battle royal. The central banks of OECD countries are sacrificing millions of workers and trillions of dollars of output at the altar of the pseudo-icon, namely, zero-inflation. This pursuit, if continued, would cost 7 per cent of GDP, that is, some five millions of jobs, in the US alone. Will the US pay this high a price for price stability?||Ranjit Sau

Further, higher levels of female literacy and female labour force participation are associated with significantly lower levels of female disadvantage in child survival.

30/3/1996- ||special articles||4403973||Early State Formation in Tribal Areas of East-Central India||This paper examines the processes through which the states emerged from within the tribal societies of the mountain and forest regions of east-central India over a long period from 450 to 1320 AD. It finds that the classical Hindu states to the north, particularly the Gupta empire, did indeed provide the principal ideological role model for the rise of those local and regional states, but that the latter were in the main home grown political structures built by autochthonous leaders from below upwards. These highland states also appear to have played a crucial historical role in the gradual fusion of the lineage based local societies into a subcontinentwide pan-Indian society. In conclusion, the paper argues that an adequate understanding of the current tribal situation in the macro-region, and indeed in the rest of India, would require an understanding of the spatially differentiated processes of political and material development rooted deep in its history. At the core of that understanding must lie the realisation that India has been built from below upwards.||Suranjit K. Saha

The Left, led the CPI(M), waged a relentless struggle to bring about a 'non-BJP, non-Congress government'. The formation of the United Front, which Congress has been forced to support unconditionally, is the first materialisation of that project. However, Jyoti Basu turned down the request to become prime minister on the pleas that the CPI(M) would form a government only when it has a strong enough mandate to implement its own policies. This pincipled position has enhanced the stature of CPI(M) as it appears willing to guide the secular forces but refuses the ultimate charm of electoral politics: premiership.||Aijaz Ahmad

These ambiguities leave the movement open to incorporation in forums which are not necessarily poor farmer-oriented.||Muzaffar Assadi

13/1/1996-20/1/1996||special articles||4403676||Political Necessity vs Lost Possibilities||Electoral politics is no longer just about good intentions or high motives but equally, and more importantly, about choosing between parties which can provide a government that manages to rule for a given period. This orientation to electoral politics has pushed into background the earlier transformative agenda and has settled onto what seems realisable. Seen in this perspective of the self-articulated experience of the people, the uncomplicated nature of the electoral response of the Himachal society in the assembly elections, 1993 makes immediate sense.||Javeed Alam

Alexandr Lebed, who had the good sense to cancel the order, tried to make light of the episode by describing it as "an unsuccessful joke".||

12/10/1996-19/10/1996||special articles||4404683||'Memories of Underdevelopment' Language and Its Identities in Contemporary Karnataka||Kannada nationalism, like all nationalisms, attempts to produce a solidarity between all Kannada speakers in order to efface the specificities of caste and class, and pits itself against other dominated minorities rather than addressing the hierarchical division of labour that has ensured Kannada's dominated status. As long as it continues to privilege the identity of Kannada over other democratic aspirations, the movement will tend increasingly towards alignment with strident communal or anti-minority forces. The movement encompasses a range of moderate and progressive intellectual positions, which have of late been overshadowed by the more strident voices. There is the danger that in the context of the structural changes already under way, benefiting a few at the expense of the rest, the ideology of the movement while expressing genuine anxieties may tend towards undemocratic resolutions of its identity crisis.||Janaki Nair
21/9/1996- ||perspectives||4404594||Neo-Liberalism and Daily Life||Data on the effects of unemployment, underemployment and low-paid employment in the US reveal a strong tendency for the downwardly mobile to direct their anger inward, to become depressed, hostile towards their family and to withdraw from neighbours, friends and former colleagues. This behaviour is aided by the major political parties, the mass media and academic publicists who point to the inevitability of 'globalisation', the virtues of 'market competitiveness' and 'need' for labour flexibility - which presents the problem of the individual victim as the product of impersonal forces beyond her/his control.||James Petras,Steve Vieux

Against this background, the author addresses some of the issues that are likely to arise in Gujarat's development over the coming years. He first reviews in somewhat greater detail Gujarat's achievement in health, education and poverty alleviation and the state of its environment and then examines the notion of sustainable development and what it means for Gujarat. The paper concludes with some goals for Gujarat for the year 2000.||Kirit S. Parikh
