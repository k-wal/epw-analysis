This has led to severe environmental degradation with significant proportions of the population, largely tribals, being displaced. Comparative studies of displacement, compensation and rehabilitation in three projects in Koraput district highlights the need for a uniform, but flexible, policy on resettlement and rehabilitation.||William Stanley

The Displaced as Victims of Development||Efforts at minimising displacement or improving resettlement will only be marginal, palliative and temporary if they are not contextualised in a wider socio-political context. Three contentions support the argument: first, that the current patterns of economic development which are constantly invoked to justify the forced eviction of people all over the country, are themselves incompatible with the goals of creating wider conditions of equity and social security. Second, despite constitutional mandates, in an overwhelming number of cases, national and regional interests violate the interests of politically and economically weaker groups and individuals. Third, political and ecological solutions sought must recognise the need to both democratise the control over the resources and processes of production and regenerate the degraded ecological resources.||Smitu Kothari

This paper assesses the nature of change displacement induces among the affected families, presenting two case studies as illustrations.||S. Parasuraman

Environmentalists have provided the required legitimacy to the agitation.||Muzaffar Assadi

The sustainability of the forest resources and the restoration of ecology can be achieved through involvement of communities dependent on forest produce. For this, an effective co-ordination between forest and revenue departments, and grass roots organisations needs to be established.||Binay Kumar Pattnaik,Anirudh Brahmachari

A feminist perspective would see science as 'conversing' with nature. The probative force necessitating a change from 'domination' to 'conversation' lies principally in the realisation of ecological threats. In order that a transformation takes place from the unilateral linear mode of communicating to a bilateral symmetric mode of communicating with nature women also must imbibe new identities which allow for dialogue.||Shefali Moitra

But their writings have often ignored the complexities of the historical formation of the Indian working class and have not dealt with many critical areas and major themes, among them, labour process and labour forms, control over and subordination of labour, leadership patterns at different levels, the relationship between the workplace and the community life outside it and proletarianisation and class formation. Furthermore, larger themes of culture, ideology and mentalities, gender dimension, or protests and deference at the macro as well as micro levels and interrelations between these and the politics involved have been neglected. The task before the labour historian today is to widen our comprehension and deepen our understanding by coming to grips with these themes and issues. The pursuit of that task does in no way require the abandonment of the Marxist perspective. That perspective must be retained. It needs to be supplemented and complemented with new perspectives such as culture linked with material foundations, gender, social identities other than class and environment and ecology.||Ranajit Das Gupta

The preservationists' shortcoming was their reliance on the state machinery, in particular on the legislative and executive power of the union government. But neither a technocracy or bureaucracy acting as the arbiter of conflicts nor a free market system which may tilt towards privatisation of open access resources would address ecological issues adequately, whereas the assertion of people's rights has the potential for a different kind of conservation-oriented control of their lives and lands. The question then becomes one of working out a new set of relations with the forest which will be enduring both for the people and the natural world. How this will be done at a time of demographic growth and agrarian intensification will be a major challenge and site-specific approaches will play a vital role.||Mahesh Rangarajan

In this context it is now essential to confront the implications of environmental degradation. Blind pursuit of growth could damage the environment, but an undue emphasis on the latter could also inhibit growth and reduction of poverty. The thrust of this paper is on gaining a fuller understanding of sustainable development by analysing the relationship between development and the environment at the global and the national level, set in the frame of the shift in emphasis from state to market led development policies. This unfolds the extent to which the development-environment interaction is embodied first in global policies, emanating from conventions and international venues, and secondly, in national policies, on agriculture, industry and trade, to transform the economy. The analysis provides some insights into the process of sustainable development and issues for further research.||Sumit Roy
