The recent proposal of the 23rd Artillery Brigade to acquire for a period of 10 years large tracts of land for a field firing and artillery practice range has prompted organised of the tribals in the region against the inevitable displacement. While their movement rests on a strong case, the discriminatory policy of the government may yet overcome people's resistance.||Nita Mishra

The Displaced as Victims of Development||Efforts at minimising displacement or improving resettlement will only be marginal, palliative and temporary if they are not contextualised in a wider socio-political context. Three contentions support the argument: first, that the current patterns of economic development which are constantly invoked to justify the forced eviction of people all over the country, are themselves incompatible with the goals of creating wider conditions of equity and social security. Second, despite constitutional mandates, in an overwhelming number of cases, national and regional interests violate the interests of politically and economically weaker groups and individuals. Third, political and ecological solutions sought must recognise the need to both democratise the control over the resources and processes of production and regenerate the degraded ecological resources.||Smitu Kothari

30/3/1996- ||review of agriculture, march 1996||4403968||Alternative Water Allocation Mechanisms: Indian and International Experiences||Water scarcity problems, escalating costs of developing new supply sources, rapid deterioration of existing water resource base, and growing demand for water from non-agricultural uses create an urgent need for reforms in water resource policies. Increasingly, the traditional policy prescription for centralised, bureaucratic control in allocating water is being challenged and new approaches in water allocation are emerging which go beyond technological innovations to look at the incentives each provides for water conservation. This paper examines the merits of the three types of alternative water mechanisms and the conditions favourable for the utilisation of one alternative over another. Lessons are drawn from experiences within India as well as other countries, where all three mechanisms exist in various locations and across sectors.||Ruth Meinzen-Dick,Meyra Mendoza

Technology may be size neutral but access to it may not be size neutral. The recent World Bank-IMF structural reform packages which stress maximum exploitation of economies of scale may deploy this argument to justify creation of large farms. Yet, socio-economic equity is as important as improvement in productivity. It would be more appropriate to make available critical inputs like water, technology, marketing knowledge to small farmers and improve production than aggregate small holdings resulting in an increase in landlessness.||Rekha Bandyopadhyay

A feminist perspective would see science as 'conversing' with nature. The probative force necessitating a change from 'domination' to 'conversation' lies principally in the realisation of ecological threats. In order that a transformation takes place from the unilateral linear mode of communicating to a bilateral symmetric mode of communicating with nature women also must imbibe new identities which allow for dialogue.||Shefali Moitra

24/2/1996- ||review of labour, february 1996||4403830||Indian Working Class and Some Recent Historiographical Issues||Marxist and progressive-minded historians have undoubtedly made important contributions, particularly in the area of workers' struggles, trade unions and the influence of political and ideological movements on these struggles and organisations. But their writings have often ignored the complexities of the historical formation of the Indian working class and have not dealt with many critical areas and major themes, among them, labour process and labour forms, control over and subordination of labour, leadership patterns at different levels, the relationship between the workplace and the community life outside it and proletarianisation and class formation. Furthermore, larger themes of culture, ideology and mentalities, gender dimension, or protests and deference at the macro as well as micro levels and interrelations between these and the politics involved have been neglected. The task before the labour historian today is to widen our comprehension and deepen our understanding by coming to grips with these themes and issues. The pursuit of that task does in no way require the abandonment of the Marxist perspective. That perspective must be retained. It needs to be supplemented and complemented with new perspectives such as culture linked with material foundations, gender, social identities other than class and environment and ecology.||Ranajit Das Gupta

The preservationists' shortcoming was their reliance on the state machinery, in particular on the legislative and executive power of the union government. But neither a technocracy or bureaucracy acting as the arbiter of conflicts nor a free market system which may tilt towards privatisation of open access resources would address ecological issues adequately, whereas the assertion of people's rights has the potential for a different kind of conservation-oriented control of their lives and lands. The question then becomes one of working out a new set of relations with the forest which will be enduring both for the people and the natural world. How this will be done at a time of demographic growth and agrarian intensification will be a major challenge and site-specific approaches will play a vital role.||Mahesh Rangarajan
27/1/1996- ||review of political economy, january 1996||4403716||Development, Environment and Poverty: Some Issues for Discussion||Transforming developing countries from an agricultural to an industrial economy has been a key thrust since the post-war years. In this context it is now essential to confront the implications of environmental degradation. Blind pursuit of growth could damage the environment, but an undue emphasis on the latter could also inhibit growth and reduction of poverty. The thrust of this paper is on gaining a fuller understanding of sustainable development by analysing the relationship between development and the environment at the global and the national level, set in the frame of the shift in emphasis from state to market led development policies. This unfolds the extent to which the development-environment interaction is embodied first in global policies, emanating from conventions and international venues, and secondly, in national policies, on agriculture, industry and trade, to transform the economy. The analysis provides some insights into the process of sustainable development and issues for further research.||Sumit Roy

It looks at various threats to sustainability of JFM in one village in Sambalpur district of Orissa, highlighting the fact that management for timber rather than merely protection by village committees is illegal. Thus, where community forest 'management' has been successful, it rests on the connivance in illegality of sympathetic forest officers.||Nandini Sundar,Abha Mishra,Neeraj Peter
08/6/1996- ||special articles||4404237||Better Resource Management for Poverty Alleviation||Although there are many reasons for our poverty - over-population, illiteracy, disease and social backwardness, to name only a few - one of the most important is the sub-optimal use that is being made today of our natural resources of land and water, which constitute between them the country's basic production apparatus and life support systems. Situated as we are, there can be no question of our ever being able to overcome poverty unless we can make very quick and substantial progress on this front. An attempt has been made in this paper to outline the present disarray in the field of resource management, to view it in its historical setting and to suggest how it may be possibly remedied before the point of no return is reached.||B.

30/3/1996- ||special articles||4403973||Early State Formation in Tribal Areas of East-Central India||This paper examines the processes through which the states emerged from within the tribal societies of the mountain and forest regions of east-central India over a long period from 450 to 1320 AD. It finds that the classical Hindu states to the north, particularly the Gupta empire, did indeed provide the principal ideological role model for the rise of those local and regional states, but that the latter were in the main home grown political structures built by autochthonous leaders from below upwards. These highland states also appear to have played a crucial historical role in the gradual fusion of the lineage based local societies into a subcontinentwide pan-Indian society. In conclusion, the paper argues that an adequate understanding of the current tribal situation in the macro-region, and indeed in the rest of India, would require an understanding of the spatially differentiated processes of political and material development rooted deep in its history. At the core of that understanding must lie the realisation that India has been built from below upwards.||Suranjit K. Saha
