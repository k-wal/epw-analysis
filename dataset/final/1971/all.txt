Section I of this paper attempts to relate the present situation to preceding developments. The problem of full capacity utilisation in the modern industrial sector and the related problems in the fields of investment, agriculture and exports are discussed in Section II. Some aspects of policies related to these problems are indicated in Section III.||V. V. Bhatt

At the same time, empirical findings show that no dramatic changes can be expected in regard to the holdings of cattle unless effective substitutes can be offered for the various goods and services which the cattle now provide directly and indirectly. In this context one must think not only of the milk and traction requirements which are now being met by cattle but the contribution they make to the fuel and fertiliser needs of millions of poor peasants. It is also important to emphasise that while surpluses of cattle might exist, such surpluses are likely to exist more in the smaller than in the larger farms. No drastic solutions, such as outright slaughter of the surpluses, can therefore be contemplated - even if they are otherwise rational - without paying heed to the distributional aspects of the problem.||K.

Its votes, too, went up by more than 30 per cent over the 1962 election. Consequently, the party activists as well as the general electorate started building up expectations that the Jan Sangh may soon provide a viable alternative to the Congress Party in the State. However, in the 1969 mid-term poll the Jan Sangh suffered a serious and sudden setback which raised doubts about its appeal and popularity, and its organisational base in the State. This paper attempts to investigate and highlight some of the salient factors that led to the rapid growth of the Jan Sangh in UP till 1967 and its steep decline in 1969. The author's analysis shows that the Jan Sangh has lacked stable support in UP and has failed to entrench itself in any firm manner. The symptoms of its decline were there all along and were only magnified in the 1969 election. Without retaining its old seats the party was scattering its energies each time in building new contacts and raising new slogans to capture new seats. As the party faces a new election, it has again evolved a new electoral strategy. Its past record, however, gives no basis for predicting the outcome of such a strategy. A party of fluctuating fortunes, the Jan Sangh in UP has an uncertain future.||V. B. Singh

Like other efforts in this direction so far, it uses data from the Farm Management Studies. But whereas the earlier studies have used aggregated data for different size-groups of farms, the present exercise uses data for individual farms. Further, in order to study the relationship between productivity and size of farms in the context of the new trends developing in Indian agriculture, the study is confined to IADP districts.

This approach, it is suggested, is efficient with respect to the amount of information required to achieve a better alignment between the use of various developmental resources and the problems on which these resources can have a significant developmental impact. This approach initially focuses on the better use of existing information; new information should be subsequently developed to fill important data gaps highlighted by the analyses conducted under this approach. A further advantage of the proposed framework is the inherent co-ordination required among policy formulation, programme design and implementation, investment planning, and the development and propagation of new agricultural technologies. The agro-climatic regions and restraints approach would facilitate the exchange of agricultural development experience among countries. It could also provide a basis for giving sharper focus to international research efforts and a better perspective as to the relative importance of different types of problems both within and among countries.||Martin E.

27/2/1971- ||review of management, february 1971||4381682||Generational Conflict in Management: Need to Identify Its Components||The inter-generational conflict in management has been much discussed of late, the reason for it being traced to the older group's fears of the superiority of the 'conceptual' knowledge possessed by the younger executives over the 'experiential' knowledge possessed by them. The contention has been that this fear evokes a defensive response among the young, leading to inter-generational tension and lack of smooth management operations. The following article argues that this model of the conflict is too simple and misleading. The 'conflict' is in fact realised through an informal organisational structure, through informal groupings of both older and younger executives formed on the basis of mutuality of interests. It is, therefore, by an analysis of these attributes that the 'conflict' can be understood and corrective measures proposed. The solutions suggested by a 'contextual' or 'process' view of the conflict are then nowhere as sharp as the original model might suggest.||J. S. Gandhi

Although the entire effort so far has been to improve and rationalise the government budgeting system, some thinking has started of late as to how the technique can be used by public sector projects. Long-range planning-a technique which uses some of the underlying concepts of performance budgeting-has for long been used by companies. The transfer to use of performance budgeting may not, therefore, be too arduous. The three aspects of performance budgeting that need attention so as to make it applicable to the corporate sector are: structural-involving a suitable function-programme-activity classification; analytical-involving the identification of alternative programmes to achieve desired objectives; and informational-so as to provide the basis for formulating a performance budget. If these three aspects are adequately covered, and once the long-range plan is also developed in relation to the wider macro situation, the introduction of performance budgeting will present little problem. And such a budget document can serve as a valuable instrument for managerial control.||U. K. Kohli

For, it may be argued that under progressive taxation the greater the inequality in income the larger the tax revenue earned by the State. But there is a false premise here. The prevailing systems of taxation in the farm and non-farm sectors are entirely different in nature and progressiveness. In fact, land revenue which is the principal direct tax on the farm sector is at best a proportional tax, whereas the income-tax on the non-farm sector is highly progressive. Nevertheless, inter-class analysis of tax burdens is valid. Its purpose is to bring out the difference between the actual tax burden and the potential capacity at the different income levels. Moreover, the revenue potential of a sector depends not simply on the overall distribution pattern but on the distribution of income above a certain minimum. The revenue potential thus depends on the level and extent of 'big' incomes in the system. This paper, therefore, measures the inter-class burden of taxation by juxtaposing two sets of data: the data on income distribution and the data on tax burdens at different income levels. Section I examines the two patterns of income distribution; Section II examines the distribution of tax burdens among the different income groups; Section III analyses inter-class 'equity' of tax burdens. [This study is an abridged version of Chapter 5 in the author's doctoral dissertation on "Tax Burden on Farm and Non-Farm Sectors in India - An Inter-Sectoral and Inter-Class Analysis", submitted to the University of Bombay in 1970.

26/6/1971- ||review of agriculture, june 1971||4382202||Quickening the Pace of Agricultural Development||The most decisive factor in agricultural development is the farmer. His behaviour and attitudes towards change can either retard or accelerate the pace of agricultural development. In an experimental programme in Raipur district of Madhya Pradesh, an attempt was made to work with farmers in such a way that they accepted changes readily. In the villages under the programme, the great majority of farmers - small, medium and large-participated; village differences were set aside, and significant agricultural development was brought about in a short period of three years; overall, farmers' participation doubled, small farmers' participation nearly tripled, acreage under high-yielding varieties increased six times, consumption of fertilisers tripled, co-operative membership went up by 84 per cent, the small farmers increased their yield by about 60 per cent and the bigger ones by about 67 per cent. The significance of the Raipur experiment is that it indicates human involvement and human development as essential to quickening the pace of agricultural development. The needed investment in human resources is negligible when compared to the benefits of substantial additional production and improvement of socio-economic condition, particularly of the weaker sections of the farming community.||B.

06/2/1971- ||special article||4381589||Unemployment: Some Policy Issues||In the short period, the scope for employment in any economy is defined by the amount and variety of the capital equipment that is available to co-operate with labour in producing the national output. There are, however, two ways in which employment may be increased even in the short run. First, the existing capital equipment can be used more intensively; factories may work more than one shift and machines may be worked longer hours. Second, a lot can be done to extend employment in old labour-intensive industries and to discover new areas of labour-intensive production. In the long run, opportunities for employment grow at the rate at which the national output expands. Obviously, the national output must grow at least as fast as the employable population if the proportion of the unemployed is to be kept constant. It must expand even more rapidly if the country has a backlog of unemployment to cope with. As a result, partly, of the leadership of advanced countries, in which labour is scarce relatively to capital, in the invention of techniques and, partly, of economies of scale, there is a tendency for large scale capital-intensive methods of production to replace small scale labour-intensive techniques as national income and with it the output of individual industries grows. In these circumstances national output must grow still more rapidly, to offset the loss of employment caused through the displacement of labour as an agent of production by capital. It is, of course, possible to muzzle the growth of capital-intensive industries in various ways, but that will be at the expense of the long run growth of employment. A developing economy with a large labour surplus is, indeed, faced with the difficult choice of more employment today against less employment tomorrow and the converse.||D. Ghosh

The segments may have their own specific features but the whole is not a sum-total of the parts. The difference between Organisational Development and other efforts is the same as the difference between corporate planning and the planning of activities in different segments of the organisation. The two must dovetail but the perspectives of each must be different. Having started with this distinction, it seems to me that the strategy and programme of development in Nitish De's model need further review and analysis. The OD strategy as described by De does not quite show how consistent it is with his concept of OD.||Ishwar Dayal

Unlike earlier Muslim organisations which participated in politics directly, the Majlis sought to influence policy-making indirectly by extending its support to individual candidates from various political parties in consideration of their personal outlook and sympathies for the Muslim community. The Majlis was also unique in that it did not seek separate representation for the Muslims but called upon Muslims and Hindus to participate in national progress side by side. The performance of the Majlis in the 1967 elections was not spectacular in terms of the number of Majlis-backed legislators elected, but it did succeed in weaning away north Indian Muslim voters from voting for the Congress as they usually had ever since Independence. Its record in influencing the Central and State governments was dismal and this, with other crises, led to its transformation into a federation of Muslim associations in 1968.||Zaheer Masood Quraishi

21/8/1971- ||special articles||4382404||Supreme Court, Parliament and Constitution-I||In Golaknath vs State of Punjab, the Supreme Court held that Parliament cannot amend the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights. Since it is Parliament's power to restrict the fundamental rights through constitutional amendment that is in doubt, no constitutional amendment of the property rights can be undertaken until Parliament is rearmed with such power. Constitutional legislation, seeking to introduce changes in the Constitution - particularly with reference to property rights - must, therefore, come in two instalments. There must first be a measure to counteract the effect of the Golaknath decision and to restore to Parliament the power to take away or abridge fundamental rights through constitutional amendment; secondly, there must be an amendment to restrict the scope of property rights. In any case, the question needs to be examined not from the narrow legal angle but from the standpoint of national policy and considerations such as welfare of the people and viability of the Constitution. A constitutional crisis or a Court-Parliament confrontation could be avoided if both Court and Parliament show appreciation of each other's constitutional roles. In this article, which is to appear in two parts, we will discuss the following aspects: In this, the first part, we discuss (i) the legal position before the Golaknath case, (ii) constitutional amendments before 1967 and (iii) the Golaknath case; in the second part, to appear next week, will be discussed (iv) interpretation of the right to property by the Supreme Court, and (v) the proposed constitutional Amendment and the likely Judicial response.||S.

Beginning early Sixties a major concern with international monetary experts has been the adequacy of international reserves to enable international trade to grow without restrictions. Many steps taken in the past indicate that the shortage of reserves is not a myth. The present dollar crisis more than any other incident that occurred previously has forced attention on the adjustment mechanism that must go along with a system of fixed exchange rate system. Another complication noted in the working of the IMF system arose from the dollar being treated as a reserve currency. It is suggested here that the new monetary system that emerges must be composed of the following three elements: (1) The authority to 'create' additional reserves through SDRs, when necessary; (2) Introduction of the 'band' proposal so that rates are allowed to fluctuate over a wider margin than is permitted now; and (3) A machinery for examining and advising the proper parity among currencies. The ability to enlarge the reserves coupled with the scope for larger fluctuation in the exchange rate would make the system more viable. A modified fixed exchange rate system such as the one envisaged alone would require India to decide on the currency to which the rupee should be tied.||C. Rangarajan

High-yielding rice varieties are one of the priority crops for receiving fertiliser, presumably because of their high response to fertiliser. This paper examines the results of experiments conducted by the All-India Co-ordinated Rice Improvement Programme (AICRIP) [1, 2] to measure the response of rice to nitrogen at a number of locations to provide additional information for decision makers.

24/4/1971- ||special articles||4381915||Meat Potential of India||The evident consequence of the taboo on beef-eating is to reduce the average food consumption in India, and in particular consumption of animal protein. It would be a fallacy, however, to assume that the taboo is the only factor that depresses protein consumption. It is necessary to look at all the depressive factors together and to assess their relative importance. As long as agriculture remains animal-powered, the primary purpose of husbandry will remain the breeding and maintenance of bullocks. India suffers from excessive requirements of animal power and inadequate fodder production to meet them. These purely economic factors are enough to prevent India from becoming a major meat consumer. Their effectiveness can be seen in Pakistan where, even with no taboo on beef, the per capita meat consumption is only 3.6 kg. The serious implications of the taboo are potential ones. For, there is much scope in India for augmenting fodder supplies and reducing animal draught requirements. While India is unsuitable for large-scale pastures owing to aridity, its waste lands can yield sizeable quantities of fodder if they are weeded and planted with grass. There is also room for the growing of fodder as a subsidiary crop in many areas. And Indian agriculture, or at least the part of it other than rice culture, is as capable of mechanisation as agriculture elsewhere. Thus, more fodder could eventually be produced or diverted from the production of draught power. The consequence of reduced animal power would be a drop in the proportion of bullocks. Male calves would be starved out just as are male buffaloes today, and the proportion of cows among cattle would rise. India could then develop a dairying industry. That is when the taboo on beef will become of consequence. For as a result of it, cows will live beyond their optimum milch life, and the output of milk per unit of fodder input will suffer. Further, the dairy industry will get no credit from the sale of dry cows; that will also push up the cost of milk.||Ashok V. Desai

In a country like India, however, programmes are necessary to popularise the acceptance and adoption of the small family norm even within the limitations imposed by the present stage of development and the slow pace of social change. Besides creating a general consciousness about the desirability and possibility of having a small, well-spaced family, the programmes have to serve those sections of the population who are already motivated with contraceptive advice and means together with medical help. They have to proceed on the principle that to be most effective they have to cater to those who are already motivated. The programmes have to be essentially for family planning (and not for population control) with due regard to the principle that the size of the family should be the free choice of the individual family, and with due recognition of the right of the family to determine the number and spacing of children and to obtain adequate information, advice and education in this respect. They have thus to be integrated with programmes of health, maternity and child welfare. Further research is needed in two directions: investigation into factors which go towards creating a strong motivation for a small family size and search for a contraceptive better suited to the conditions of developing countries like India. The spread of education, particularly among women, is a basic requirement for the success of all family planning programmes; yet we are far from reaching even the full literacy target and seem to grow more and more complacent about it. Family planning programmes have meanwhile to proceed within the limitations imposed by the prevailing socio-economic and cultural conditions. No short cuts or gimmicks like national or patriotic appeals or lurid threats of a frightening population explosion will be of much help. Similarly, grandiose programmes based on unrealistic assumptions and worked with insufficient forethought or preparation inevitably lead to gross failures resulting in disenchantment and frustration on the one hand and exaggeration and misrepresentation on the other.||A.

The army may win in East Bengal, but only temporarily; the final victory will be with the people of Bengal. The question has been raised whether there is a chance of a similar movement in West Pakistan. In West Pakistan also the people suffer from the terrible injustice done to them by their rulers and the major political parties are still assuring them of immediate action. But is it possible for them to plunge into an armed struggle against their rulers? An attempt is made here to discuss, in this context, the role of the major political parties of West Pakistan.||Ashim Mukhopadhyay

In this paper it is argued that shadow prices as computed from linear programming models of development planning are far from satisfactory as an instrument of planning. Apart from the question of feasibility of solving a sufficiently large size programming problem, there are doubts whether the dual solution would be comparatively consistent, robust and stable. Besides, there are reservations as to the validity of the simplifying assumptions of economic relations implied in a programming model.||Ranjit K. Sau

1/7/1971- ||dialectics of transition||4382354||On the Political Economy of the Transition Period||In most writings on 'socialist economics' one sees either of the two following mistakes: (a) propositions that are valid for a socialist society are taken as valid for a transitional society; and (b) propositions that are valid for a transitional society are taken as valid for a socialist society. Apart from theoretically confusing the transitional society with socialism, economists professing Marxism have, by and large, held that a country becomes socialist immediately after the successful proletarian revolution. Alternatively, these economists have, quite undialectically, accepted as inevitable a country's march to socialism once political power was captured by the proletariat. The experience of the construction of socialism - with its positive and negative sides - during the last half century has left them surprisingly unaffected. While there is no 'Chinese wall' between the transitional society in question and socialism and while the former grows into the latter provided certain conditions are fulfilled, it is also important not to confuse the two distinct historical stages. Such confusion leads either to the neglect of the specific tasks of the transitional period - i e, the preparation of the material base for the 'first phase of communism' by eliminating the elements of capitalism and strengthening the elements of socialism - or to the complacent and dangerous notion that the society being already socialist, elements of capitalism have been eliminated and the danger of historical reversal does not any more exist. Against this stage of the discussion of the subject, Charles Bettelheim's "Calcul Economic et Formes de Propriete" really constitues a 'great leap forward'. Though the basic structure of his work follows from the classics of Marxism-Leninism, in its analysis of the economic problems of the transitional society it is a creative development of Marxism-Leninism. In fact, besides Bettelheim, Sweezy seems to have been the only well known economist who has been trying to raise some of the related questions. Now Bettelheim has come forward with a complete conceptual framework necessary for a proper analysis of the possible directions that a transitional society could take - either forward to socialism or backward to capitalism. He has thus laid bare "the economic law of motion" of such a society.||Paresh Chattopadhyay

There is thus economic pressure to spread out the overhead costs by achieving high rates of utilisation. State tube wells operate much closer to engineering capacity than do the private tube wells. They pump twice the volume of water and irrigate three times the hectarage per unit of pumping capacity of the private tube wells. But such rates result in increased breakdowns and the consequent unreliability of water supplies. In situations of traditional crop patterns, traditional varieties, and low levels of fertiliser use, such unreliability is not costly - though it does tend to discourage input such as the introduction of high-yielding varieties and high levels of fertiliser use. Given the comparative costs, pricing systems, crop patterns, and yields shown in the following survey, a change in the operation of state tube wells to resemble the operation of private tube wells would result in substantially decreased revenues to the state tube wells but it would greatly increase returns to society as a whole.

The Reserve Bank of India's studies on finances of private limited companies, for example, are restricted to the relatively large and generally better off companies, even though the bulk of private limited companies are small and do not do well. Further, data on an adequate basis have not yet been compiled on the structural aspects of this segment of the private corporate sector. This study, therefore, was undertaken to probe the pattern of ownership, directorship, and financial structure, and to analyse the financial performance of the private limited companies on a census basis. Maharashtra was selected for the study as it covers a large proportion of the private limited companies in the country. [This project was undertaken at the UGC Centre for Advanced Study in Economics, University of Bombay. It was initiated by R K Hazari, whose guidance and invaluable suggestions were always available. The data used were obtained from the Office of the Registrar of Companies in Bombay with the kind permission of the Company Law Board, Government of India, and were processed at the Electronic Data Processing Centre, University of Bombay. Indu Kale worked on this project almost from the beginning. J C Sandesara and B V Mehta have made useful suggestions. None of them, nor any of the many others who were associated with this project, is responsible for the analysis and conclusions for which the responsibility is entirely the author's.

That the need for these amendments should have become apparent in so short a time shows how unimaginatively and carelessly the Act had been drafted. All the cases referred to the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission so far, relate to control of concentration of economic power. Making the Act more effective in checking concentration of economic power is not, however, a matter of only plugging loopholes in its provisions. Given the facts of our economic situation, it will not do to pretend that preventing concentration of economic power in the hands of a few large business groups does not conflict with the objective of rapid industrial growth. Under the new licensing policy fresh investment by big business houses is by and large restricted to core sector industries. Since the core sector consists of industries which are vital to the economy every project in this sector is by definition in the public interest. The Monopolies Commission is thus likely to find that while every project in the core sector promoted by a large house will result in increasing the economic power of the group in question it will be difficult, if not impossible, for the Commission to rule that this increase in concentration will be against the public interest. Merely amending the Act will not help to resolve this dilemma. Before amending the Act, the Government will have to clarify its thinking on all aspects of industrial planning and policy and, in the process, decide its long-term policy towards large business houses and their place in the industrial growth of the country. This will require the Government to formulate clearly its views on the role of the public sector and, even more important, devise policies which will ensure that the public sector in fact fulfils this role. This is vital because, as the experience so far shows, the Government leans on the large houses mainly to fill the gaps left by the failure of the public sector to fulfil the role assigned to it. As far as amendment of the Act is concerned, the main provisions which require revision are: (i) Section 2(g) which sets out the criteria for indentifying 'interconnected' undertakings; (ii) Section 26 which provides for registration of dominant and other undertakings to which the provisions of Chapter III of the Act apply; (iii) Section 2(j) which defines a 'monopolistic' undertaking; and (iv) Section 33(1) which lays down the criteria of registrability of restrictive trade agreements.||A.

But recent experience in respect of engineering manpower has shown that abject surrender to market forces might be too costly. This paper attempts to suggest certain parameters of a policy on scientific manpower. It traces the trend in the supply of natural scientists, excluding engineers and doctors, with post-graduate or higher qualifications over the period 1950-65. The distribution of employed scientists in different types of organisations is examined to bring out their employment pattern. The paper also deals with the income structure of scientists and examines their spatial mobility.

Except in a few States - such as Maharashtra, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu - there has not been the minimum devolution of functions and powers necessary for any of the Panchayati Raj institutions to be actively involved in the planning of developmental activities at their respective levels. Even where to some degree such devolution has been effected, these institutions have been entrusted mainly with the provision and management of social services (more particularly, education and health) and civic amenities. In only a very limited number of States are these institutions involved in developmental work relating to agriculture and, even in these cases, their role seems to have been conceived of mainly as that of intermediaries for channelling funds for schemes proposed and worked out at higher levels. If institutions of local government are to serve as active instruments for decentralised planning - not merely as allocating or distributing agencies within an organisational framework that is otherwise highly centralised - it is essential to determine what kind of developmental work can be planned and administered most effectively at which level. One can then decide how the responsibilities and powers in respect of developmental activities should be distributed between the Centre, the States and the local government institutions and also to what extent autonomy and flexibility at these different levels of decision-making and execution can be built into the system with advantage. Another important step is a strengthening of planning at the State level. This would require, apart from changes in Centre-State financial arrangements, improvements in the methodology of planning at this level and efforts to frame realistic development programmes suited to the needs of each State which it can expect to implement with the resources likely to be available to it. In fact, changes in Centre-State financial relations are important and significant only if the other necessary supporting measures are taken at the State level. In States where (as in Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh) planning from below has been conceived in terms of transferring to zilla parishads and/or panchayat samitis executive powers and developmental responsibilities in respect of certain broad developmental heads like education, health, etc, and the activities in these fields are supported mainly by grants from the State governments concerned, it may be difficult now to reverse the changes already made. In States where no steps of this kind have been taken so far it may be worthwhile experimenting with planning from below along somewhat different lines. One such line of experimentation is suggested in this note.||K. N. Raj

27/3/1971- ||review of agriculture, march 1971||4381791||Green Revolution and Agricultural Employment and Incomes in Western UP||While the new agricultural technology has significantly increased foodgrains production, relatively little is known about its potential impact on agricultural employment and incomes. In this paper, a linear programming model is employed to examine the implications of general acceptance of the new technology for agricultural employment and incomes in a single development block in Western UP. The new technology available to local farmers in 1967-68, it is assumed, will be generally adopted by 1972-73, and the resource productivities on farms using the new inputs in 1967-68 are assumed to be representative of all farms in the block in 1972-73. The results of the exercise indicate that widespread adoption of the new technology will substantially increase total agricultural employment in the area and will raise average agricultural wages, with most of the wage increase coming in the October-November post-monsoon harvest period. Despite the rise in wages, agricultural incomes of landless labourers will rise less than those of landowners; and the widespread use of labour-saving machinery will, it seems, drastically reduce the incomes of landless labourers. On the other hand, the results suggest that the new technology will work to the advantage of smaller farmers if crucial inputs such as fertilisers are evenly distributed on the basis of area operated. However, the results presented here do not give conclusive evidence about the effects of the new technology on employment and incomes, as several limitations are imposed by assumptions made and data used.||Ian R.

The attempt to develop a new radical economics represents an effort to provide an intellectual basis for a more effective attack on the manifest ills of American society than the discredited liberals could mount in the past decade. The radical wants to understand better why poverty, racism and sexism persist in the United States, why American troops and bombs continue to be sent to distant lands to wreak their havoc on innocent peoples, why the natural environment is destroyed in the name of progress, why increasing wealth does not appear to lead to greater human welfare but only to a heightened sense of alienation on the job, in the community and at home. The radical suspects that these problems are in fact deeply rooted in the basic institutions of American capitalist society. To understand and to combat these problems, the radical requires an analysis of the fundamental nature, structure and dynamics of that society. This article seeks to describe briefly the origins and the content of the new radical economics that has attracted increasing attention and a growing following in the United States.||Thomas E.

Although, no clear polarisation has emerged on this issue it is possible to discern the contours of an emerging pattern which is likely to survive the results of the 1971 election. The experience with political instability at the State level between 1967 and 1971 has alerted the political elites to the desirability of preserving stability at the Centre. On the other hand, there have also been new converts to the argument for more powers for the States. But generally it seems to be agreed that the States should become stable power centres, more complementary to than competitive with the Central power.||B. L. Maheshwari

Also, certain areas of the country are more prone to droughts and floods than are other areas. These factors have made sustained growth in production difficult. Whatever the causes of fluctuations in production, the variability around the trend follows a pattern which is identifiable from an analysis of past production data and can be projected into future years with some probability. Since these fluctuations are evidently unavoidable, the best strategy is to stock a 'certain' quantity of foodgrains to buffer contingencies arising from natural factors. Scientific planning to meet such contingencies is possible only after an analysis of weather-induced fluctuations in production over different parts of the country. This article attempts to estimate production variations due to weather. Since rainfall appears to be the most important causal factor in fluctuations, suitable rainfall indices are computed to analyse the rainfall distribution pattern and its effect on crop output. Finally, these tools are used to determine the technical size of necessary reserve stocks. Economic constraints, however, are not considered here in determining the size of the required reserve stocks.

The Reserve Bank of India's studies on finances of private limited companies, for example, are restricted to the relatively large and generally better off companies, even though the bulk of private limited companies are small and do not do well. Further, data on an adequate basis have not yet been compiled on the structural aspects of this segment of the private corporate sector. This study, therefore, was undertaken to probe the pattern of ownership, directorship, and financial structure, and to analyse the financial performance of the private limited companies on a census basis. Maharashtra was selected for the study as it covers a large proportion of the private limited companies in the country. This is the third and last instalment of the study. The first part, published on July 3, summarised the main findings. The second part, which appeared last week, dealt with ownership and management. This last part examines the financial structure and performance of these companies. [This project was undertaken at the UGC Centre for Advanced Study in Economics, University of Bombay. It was initiated by R K Hazari, whose guidance and invaluable suggestions were always available. The data used were obtained from the Office of the Registrar of Companies in Bombay with the kind permission of the Company Law Board, Government of India, and were processed at the Electronics Data Processing Centre, University of Bombay. Indu Kale worked on this project almost from the beginning. J C Sandesara and B V Mehta have made useful suggestions. None of them, nor any of the many others who were associated with this project, is responsible for the analysis and conclusions for which the responsibility is entirely the author's.]||V. D. Lall

1/7/1971- ||environmental planning||4382343||Environmental Quality Management and Development Planning||There is a section of opinion which holds that environmental quality management is something developing countries need not think about for some time to come, till their GNP has reached high enough levels. But this is a limited view, both of development which should signify more than just economic growth and of processes by which damage to the environment occurs even as GNP is being increased. This article argues that developing countries cannot afford to take such a restricted, accounting view of their long-term development. The planning in developing countries should encompass objectives that are not strictly calculable by cost-benefit analysis and methods that capitalise on public participation.

25/9/1971- ||special articles||4382567||'Freeing' the 'Free' Press||The main source of the shortcomings of the Government's current proposals to diffuse the ownership of newspapers is that they rely exclusively on the law and not at all on incentive. And that too they do by extending to such a varied and flexible industry as newspaper publishing the complicated provisions of India's most cumbersome piece of legislation, the Companies Act. The aims of the law for the present purpose should be to (a) curtail the power of non-publishing finance in the newspaper industry by liquidating the nexus with the high finance of business; (b) discourage concentration of ownership of circulation by providing for more fair competition and greater dispersal; and (c) ensure a reasonable degree of editorial independence. These objectives can be achieved through two of the provisions of the proposed legislation - those relating to corporate finance and managerial personnel -, supplemented by (a) either a price-page schedule or a steeply slabbed tax on all advertisement revenue above the level needed for comfortable viability at a circulation of, say, 100,000; (b) a requirement that newspapers must provide safeguards for editorial independence; and, (c) the power to treat each newspaper in a group as a separate entity for financial purposes but the group as a whole as a single entity for the allocation of newsprint. Beyond that the government should only use, and needs to use only, incentives which are best applied through a newspaper finance corporation and disincentives which it has the power to apply so long as newsprint has to be rationed. As it is, the slabbed system of newsprint allocation has begun to have some impact: the dip in the statistics of the bigger newspapers between 1967 and 1968 has not been wholly made up. Further refined, and aided by the suggested supplementary legislation, these tools can bring about all the desired changes.||Pran Chopra
26/6/1971- ||review of agriculture, june 1971||4382203||Green Revolution and Agrarian Conflict||The prevailing explanation of agrarian conflicts and unrest in the countryside may be summarised as follows: The strategy of agricultural development adopted so far has been mainly production-oriented and the problem of distributive justice has remained unattended to; the fruits of the 'green revolution' are pocketed mainly by the rich and prosperous farmers and the disparity between them and the havenots, particularly landless labourers, has increased; the increased disparity has led to a sense of deprivation among the weaker and poorer agrarian classes and their frustrations are manifest in agrarian tensions, occasionally leading to eruption and violence. This causal explanation of agrarian tensions, it is suggested in this paper, is naive and too simple; the problem is much more enormous and complex. The major factors involved in agrarian conflict, the author suggests, are (i) perception of prevalent disparities in income by the rural poor; (ii) the strength of the agricultural labour force and its consciousness of its political bargaining power; (iii) the existence of an adequate support-structure provided by the political parties; (iv) the rising aspirations of the rural masses; and (v) the increasing lack of fit between the socio-political framework and the economic order.||T.

The interactions began with the European expansion of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and has continued down to the present day. The societies of the dominated countries changed radically in the process but did not become mirror-images of the metropolitan capitalist societies. The precise changes in these societies depended on the pre-existing social structure. But the end result was for all of them the creation of a state of backwardness in relation to the advanced capitalist societies. The present notes are, strictly speaking, explorations in methodology. It is submitted that only confusion can arise in treating pure competition as the rule and monopolistic structures as the exception under capitalism. Among academic economists, Piero Sraffa was one of the first to stress that the theory of monopoly should swallow up the theory of firm behaviour. But by the beginning of the twentieth century Marxists led by Lenin, Bukharin, Hilferding and Rosa Luxemburg had grasped the same point and applied it to the study of advanced capitalist societies as a whole. Some recent findings in this field make this position now virtually unimpeachable. The older approach to underdevelopment in terms of climatic conditions and national or racial characteristics has now found a respectable garb in the theory that the "initial conditions" of the underdeveloped countries were not right for sustained economic growth. Such an approach fails to recognise the dynamic or, rather, the dialectical nature of the problem of development. Curiously enough, in an age which is characterised by man's progressive victory over nature, this approach emphasises the "natural" conditions on development! These notes also summarise some of the things we already know about the processes of interaction between underdeveloped and advanced countries and question some dogmas which are implicit in the current ideology regarding underdevelopment. Among other things, it is claimed that (a) the seeds of economic progress need not be sought in the same type of capitalist or pre-capitalist society everywhere (correspondingly, there is no reason why every society aiming at socialism should pass through the capitalist stage-a point which is not elaborated in the present article); (b) the progress of particular societies has often been uneven and such unevenness has been imposed by developments in other societies; (c) the phenomena of trade and money have taken very different forms in different societies and have had very different effects; and, (d) the relation between economic growth and demographic change must be viewed as a dialectical one.||A.

The author then suggests that the available facts do not support the characterisation by Jagdish Bhagwati and Padma Desai of the Indian industrial experience as following from a 'Stakhanovite' or 'ambitious' and 'heavy industries first' approach. Finally, arguing that the basic problems of Indian industrial planning are technological and economic and not ideological, the author discusses the different policy prescriptions suggested by Bhagwati and Desai.||Yoginder K.

16/10/1971- ||special articles||4382667||Wage Determination of Unorganised Labour in Construction Industry||This article attempts to determine the main forces behind the movement of wages of unskilled male labourers engaged in the road and building construction projects on the basis of a field survey carried out by the present writer in the union territory of Tripura during December 1967 to November 1968. It also tries to compare the results with all-India data on the basis of published all-India data. The statistical relationship that could be established within the limitation of our field study shows relative rigidity of money wages, particularly in the context of food prices. From 1960 onwards, excepting 1963 and 1964, the real wage showed a continuous downward trend while 1964 onwards money wages remained pegged at Rs 3.50 per man-day. The insignificance of the cost of living in wage fixation in Tripura may be due to the virtual absence of collective bargaining. One of the chief aims of trade unions is to neutralise the rise in the cost of living. One reason for the relative rigidity of the money wages of unskilled construction labourers to their cost of living may be that collective bargaining is non existent among them. Another reason seems to be that employers do not find it difficult to get adequate supply of labour at the wage rate predetermined by them on considerations other than the cost of living. In a declining supply of labour due to a fall in real wages, the employers would get hold of scarce supply of labour by suitably increasing their remuneration, so that an increase would occur even in the absence of trade union activity. But if a rise in the supply of labour continues to overtake the demand for it, the effects of the former may dampen those of the latter as well as of the cost of living. Besides, a rigidity in the money wage to the cost of living may itself augment the supply of labour force: in order to neutralise the impact of a rise in prices there may be a shift in the proportion of wage-earners with additional members of the family trying to earn something. A rigidity in the money wage to the cost of living may, therefore, bring a large influx of labourers to the project site which in turn may again dampen the wage-elevating forces of demand.

29/5/1971- ||review of management, may 1971||4382060||Management Reporting Systems: Structure and Design||A management reporting system is essentially a mechanism for monitoring the 'mission' of an organisation. That mission has usually been defined by a formal plan in terms of three distinct streams: the desired organisation structure; the time-phased statement of organisational goals; and the critical variables for success. To the extent that the formal plan is imprecise or inadequate, failing to take into account the actuality of the real-life situation, the de facto points of decision-making, and the personnel, the monitoring system becomes open-ended and ineffective. Designers of the reporting system must, therefore, take into account the impact on it of such constraints. A good management reporting system will not make a company successful. It is the people in the organisation, not the system, that make for corporate success. Yet, lacking a proper management reporting system, management at various levels will have no way of registering their accomplishments in relation to targets, or of taking remedial action. A related question in the mechanics of designing a management reporting system is the frequency and content of report at the various management levels. An answer to this question, too, has to be related to the three components of the formal control system, since the nature of the information to be provided and its frequency, at each level, must necessarily depend on the control characteristics of each level of management.||S.

13/2/1971- ||special articles||4381617||How Large a Buffer Stock of Raw Jute?||The creation, maintenance and operation of buffer stocks involve a wide range of problems. These include problems of finance, storage, grading, baling, location, turnover of stocks, setting up of a proper agency, monopoly of imports and exports, fixation of price range for purchase and sale, etc. These problems are important but are outside the scope of this article. An attempt has been made here, instead, to estimate the required size of buffer stock of raw jute. This has been done by measuring the deviations in production around the trend line and on the basis of the past behaviour of the jute mills and the traders. On such calculations a buffer stock of 15 lakh bales of raw jute and mesta is indicated. This rather large stock is necessary to meet the wide fluctuations in production as well as to counteract the speculative activities of the jute mills and the trade. Moreover, the composition of the raw jute buffer stock has to match the qualitative requirements of the jute industry. The financial, administrative and operational bottlenecks involved in the maintenance of such a large buffer stock, will have to be provided for after taking into account the magnitude of the problem of the jute economy.

The old-fashioned political scientists wanted to anchor political studies firmly to constitutional law and studies of governmental institutions; Duvergerian political scientists to party systems; and those concentrating on election studies to voting behaviour. Each of these has an important contribution to make but a fast-growing political system is a 'many-spendoured thing', demanding many types of investigation into many areas. It demands even experimenting with models other than the simple structural/functional models - for example, gaming models or dialectical models which need not be the monopoly of Marxists. It may be worth going further to simulate fairly complex models in the computer or on paper. In fact, models based on actual research conclusions, where available, combined with explicit plausible assumptions, where they are not, when simulated quantitatively may tell us a lot about areas for future concern or investigation. Such sophisticated speculation can also tell us much about the breaking points of the system and their dangerous possibilities. A complex political system deserves no less; it demands variegated research, complex simulation, and continuous analysis for its understanding.||V. Subramaniam,N. Srinivasan
25/9/1971- ||review of agriculture, september 1971||4382562||Capitalist Development in Agriculture: A Note||In recent years there has emerged a tendency towards profit-oriented production and investment in land by a section of the cultivating population. Many observers think they see a new class of capitalist farmers emerging. There had been, however, no quantitative studies attempting to isolate the characteristics of capitalist farmers or to apply any criteria to identify the capitalists. Ashok Rudra with A Majid and B D Talib carried out a sample survey of big farmers in Punjab and, after attempting to isolate the capitalists from the sample by certain statistical methods, came to the conclusion that no group of capitalist farmers could be identified. The author conducted a small survey in 1969 of 66 big farmers scattered over 10 districts in 5 states. The aim was to concentrate on detailed case studies of big farmers selected purposively with a wide geographical scatter. The results of the survey show that a new class of capitalist farmers is emerging. This is a phenomenon common to every region, insofar as every area has been subject to the same forces - albeit operating with varying intensity - of an expanding market and enhanced profitability of agricultural production. The rate at which capitalist development is occurring varies widely in different regions depending on many historical and current circumstances; it may be near zero in some: but the reality of the process cannot be denied.||Utsa Patnaik

1/1/1971- ||competitive politics and electoral change||4381549||Partisanship and Political Development||The stability and even the survival of India's present political system will depend ultimately not on whether there are one or two dominant political parties or a number of competing parties, but on whether a large proportion of the voter population feels that it has a stake in the political system. In developing this stake political parties play a crucial role. Whether the acute problems of economic development, gross disparities in income, regional imbalances and group deprivation will be worked out within the bounds of the present institutional framework, will depend on how permeable and adaptive the party structures are in absorbing vast peripheries of the population into their support bases and in effectively conveying the needs of the party supporter to the decision-making structures of society. This paper examines these hypothetical propositions in the light of empirical data gathered in a national sample survey of the 1967 general elections. Answers are sought to three specific questions. First, what proportions of the voter population exhibit commitment and loyalty to specific political parties? Second, do citizens manifesting committed or partisan attitudes and behaviour also possess other political characteristics, indicating a greater degree of political awareness and involvement, in contrast to those who are either low on partisanship or totally lack party identification? Third, does partisanship provide new and secular collective identifications cutting across varying social, economic and demographic strata?||D. L. Sheth

They satisfy a variety of social and psychological needs of the system and of its managers. They help provide rationality to behaviour in the organisation and justification for managerial inactivity or failure; they minimise anxiety by transferring managerial failures to external events or to the powers that guide their destiny. The function of myths lies in the fact that without them, feelings of guilt, aggression and anxiety about one's failures would be far too intense and the resulting neurosis would make work far too difficult For this paper I have chosen four common myths which I believe have come to form the props of administrative policy in organisations: They are: (1) "Time is a great healer". (2) "No tool is more potent than example". (3) "People live to co-operate". (4) "Employees resist change". I shall examine these myths not so much to suggest that all these beliefs are wrong but to explore the extent to which their limitations affect the organisation.||Ishwar Dayal

It is rather unfortunate that maharajas and not municipalities got all the prominence in the first round of the battle. In fact, the possibility of municipalities getting any attention from the champions of socialism who are all the time concerned with national issues is indeed remote. The cities continue to be neglected by the State Governments as well as the Central Government though there is a belated realisation that the neglect of Calcutta has been suicidal from any point of view - political, economic or social.||Ashish Bose

27/2/1971- ||special articles||4381686||Princes in Indian Politics||The princes have assumed new and increasingly active roles within the political system. Strikingly it is the operation of that system to which the bulk of the responsibility must go for the increase in princely political activity. If the former rulers had been "left alone" after giving up their thrones, only a few would have sought political office, but most would probably have faded from public view. They were, however, not left alone; political parties intruded, offering the former rulers political status in exchange for the votes they could deliver from among their former subjects. Foremost among the parties exploiting this arrangement was the same Congress party which has recently tried to end all princely privilege. Similarly, the events designed to eliminate the last vestiges of princely status have paradoxically led to the political revival of the princes who have been drawn into further political activity in defence of their privy purses and privileges and-by their perspective-their honour. As they shed the aloofness which has kept many out of competitive politics, the princes may also be expected to shed some of the mystique which has undergirded their traditional support. Only their ability to convert traditional resources into political gains while learning new political and organisational skills will determine whether the short-term resurgence of the princes will be maintained as a long-term characteristic of Indian politics.||William L.

A system based on reliance on the market mechanism for investment and import decisions and removal of controls, particularly industrial licensing and import tariffs and restriction is unlikely to lead to the right investment decisions - both as regards the volume of investment and the nature of industries set up. The market mechanism is subject to too many well known imperfections and rigidities for it to be assumed that investment would necessarily flow into the desired industries. Nor will such a system be able to substantially dispense with public sector investment. Actually, there has been little wrong with India's planning system or philosophy. The major imbalance was not in the country's international trade account but in its savings-investment account. The blame for this must be laid squarely on the economic policy framework and the economic administration system used in conjunction with planning. It was the incongruity between planning on the one hand and the economic policy framework and the system of economic administration on the other which has been responsible for the troubled progress of planned development.||Phiroze B.

Any plan to revitalise the economy of small farmers would therefore require outright financial grants or liberal credit from external sources. Lending policies of existing agencies that provide long-term farm finance, however, are biased against the small farmer who in their terms is not an attractive client. Even the land development banks which are co-operative institutions have lending policies that automatically discriminate against the small farmer. This paper considers the availability of long-term finance to small farmers in the context of the lending policies of the Gujarat State Co-operative Land Development Bank which is one of the most successful LDBs in the country, and what changes may be necessary if small farmers are not to be excluded from the gains of agricultural development.

18/12/1971- ||special articles||4382885||Electricity Pricing in Uttar Pradesh||The State Electricity Board of Uttar Pradesh, like the Boards in other states, has evolved a tariff structure which aims to cover costs and earn a net rate of return of three per cent on capital. In practice a number of other considerations, too, have determined rates. The result is a complicated tariff structure which is not too clearly governed by any pricing principles nor is based on any accurate calculation of costs. In fact, the Board does not have any data on the various categories of costs, and does not keep separate accounts on generation costs from the different stations. Moreover, its finances are in the red with deficits increasing every year. This paper describes the present tariff structure of the UP State Electricity Board and outlines the principles on which it appears to be constructed. It then discusses the lines on which the structure needs to be changed, if electricity tariff is to have any rational relation to costs and the State Electricity Board is to run as a viable undertaking.||S.

In the context of India's plural society, in which the long continuity and stability of multiple traditional cultures makes the unified democratic experiment anyhow more complicated, the task of harmonising the particular and exclusive demands of minorities with the nation's general processes of change becomes all the more perilous. If only for this reason a study of minority politics in all its ramifications acquires a certain primacy for construction of relevant hypotheses of India's functional policies. Of all the minorities, the Muslims occupy a distinctive place in Indian politics for many reasons: because of their proportion in the population which makes them the single biggest minority; because of their historical role, cultural contribution, social distinctiveness and urban and semi-urban habitation contrasted with their present cultural bewilderment, social degeneracy, educational decline and economic backwardness; and because of their sense of political despair so unwisely perpetuated by the existence of an exclusivistic non-secular, uncreative and inept leadership. For a clearer understanding of Indian politics, no less than for a better appreciation of the Muslim response to the processes of secularisation and modernisation in India, systematic studies of Muslim politics under different situations and conditions and in different parts and regions of the country are called for. This paper studies the traditional leadership situation among Muslims in a major urban political centre of Muslims, the city of Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh. The paper has been published in two parts. In this, the second, part the author studies certain major aspects of the Muslim problem in Hyderabad and also seeks to suggest a general framework for understanding communal polarisation. The first part of the article, which appeared last week, examined the process of communal polarisation in Hyderabad city politics in successive elections and discussed traditional Muslim parties in Hyderabad and their leaderships.||Rasheeduddin Khan

29/5/1971- ||special articles||4382065||Competitiveness of Indian Steel Exports||The significant rise in India's steel exports in recent years was undoubtedly facilitated by the industrial recession. With the onset of domestic revival, exports have begun to decline. Yet, in the long run, steel exports may be worth encouraging. A continued export programme can be sustained only if adequate capacities are built in to produce those categories in which we are most competitive. The purpose of this paper is to examine both the short-run and long-run export competitiveness of the five major steel categories manufactured by the main steel producers and rerollers in India. The 'FOB export realisation' has been used to gauge short-run competitiveness, while the 'domestic resource cost' has been employed to measure long-term competitiveness. The five categories have then been ranked by these criteria. It becomes evident that the conflict between exports and domestic demand-pull might have been accommodated if the available billet capacity had been fully utilised. In any case, the conflict points up to the need to curtail luxury uses of bars and rods. In fact, the 'domestic resource cost' criterion shows up that the opportunity cost of restricting the export of bars and rods has been rather high. A better insight into the country's comparative advantage in steel can be had by considering the major product groups separately. At the same time, estimation of the domestic resource costs of foreign exchange for the major product groups, by providing a basis for comparing the relative performance of the industries that have been built up in the country, would provide policy-makers useful guidelines for future investment decisions.||Samuel Paul

06/3/1971- ||special article||4381715||Fluctuating Voter Loyalties: Budhlada Assembly Constituency in 1969||This article is an attempt to find a consistent pattern in the distribution of votes among the parties in the 1967 and 1969 elections in Budhlada Assembly constituency, which is part of a socio-economically diverse region and has never had very constant voter loyalties. Over a period of 19 years, Budhlada voters have exercised their franchise eight times - each time, differently. The major contenders for political power have been the Congress, the Akali Dal, and the Communists. A breakdown reveals that, while the first two parties held the seat for nine years each, the Communists secured it for one year. In view of the keenness of electoral competition and the shifting voter loyalties in Budhlada, it is interesting to examine the circumstances that determined voter support in 1967 and 1969. It is found that while intra-party harmony and campaign strategy and organisation may have immediate impact, the socio-economic context is also highly relevant to the voting decision. As the proportion of agricultural labourers increases, for instance, the drift is Leftward; similarly, as the distribution of Government patronage in terms of amenities decreases, the drift is towards the opposition. The stability of electoral politics, it would seem, depends largely on the ecological make-up of the area, the socio-economic context playing a crucial role in the elections. Low concentration of scheduled castes, high literacy rate, less pressure on land, low proportion of agricultural labourers, greater participation in economic activity, and lower concentration of displaced persons - appear to be factors that give a polling area a stable support base. On the other hand, high social and economic diversity results in fluctuating voter loyalties, making the area shift its support from time to time.||R. Chandidas

In the first part, which appeared last week, the author examined the available evidence on the growth of disparities between East and West Pakistan. In this the concluding part, are presented some hypotheses to explain the growth of disparity with the purpose of isolating the factors that contributed the most. It is difficult to find any systematic explanation of this growth of regional disparity in Pakistan. Several factors operated together and their interrelations gave rise to the disparity, but which factor or combination of factors were principally responsible for this pattern of growth is difficult to specify. In this part of the article some hypotheses will be presented with the purpose of isolating the factors that contributed most to this growth of disparity. They cannot be considered established, however, with the nature of evidence that is available. They have to be regarded only as tentative hypotheses, indicating lines of further research needed to settle this question with some confidence.||Arjun Sengupta

02/1/1971- ||special articles||4381484||Poverty in India - I: Dimensions and Trends||In 1960-61, 40 per cent of the rural population and 50 per cent of the urban population lived below the poverty line, that is with diets inadequate even in respect of calories. During the eight years from 1960-61 to 1968-69, the per capita consumer expenditure increased by 4.8 per cent or by about half a per cent per annum. It is obvious that this could make little impression on poverty unless the poorer sections profited proportionately more than the average and much more so than the rich. A superficial examination and comparison of the National Sample Survey estimates of consumer expenditure in 1960-61 and 1967-68, as is commonly done, gives an impression that the inequalities in the distribution of consumer expenditure have narrowed down during the past decade. Unfortunately this is not true. The NSS estimates of consumption in 1967-68 are gross underestimates and the underestimation is particularly serious in the case of consumption of the upper-middle and the richer sections. Even a conservative correction of the NSS estimates on this account makes it clear that the small gains of development during the past decade have been very unequally distributed and the gulf between the rich and the poor has widened. The Planning Commission has meanwhile directed its attention exclusively to achieving a high rate of growth. Its perspective for the coming decade is that the national income will be doubled in the 12 years from 1968-69 to 1980-81 and that the per capita consumer expenditure will rise by 42 per cent. Further, it smugly assumes that benefits of development will be automatically distributed equally between the rich and the poor and that, therefore, by 1980-81, everybody in the country, except the poorest 10 per cent, will rise above the poverty line. But if the past trends continue, the national income cannot increase by more than 50 per cent and the per capita consumer expenditure cannot increase by more than 9 per cent in the 12 years from 1968-69 to 1980-81. Further if these small gains continue to be monopolised by the upper-middle and the richer sections allowing only a trickle to flow down to the poor, it will take 50 years before everyone is lifted above the poverty line. The processes of economic development, as we have witnessed them in the past, require that the rich must become much more rich before the poor can secure the minimum. But much before this happens, the gulf between the rich and the poor will widen intolerably and inevitably undermine the democratic foundations of the economy. Indeed, if it is allowed to continue unchecked there is enough time between now and 1980-81 for the process to be completed. [This study was prepared by the Indian School of Political Economy, Poona, under a contract from the Ford Foundation. The Ford Foundation has recently released a number of studies prepared by its own research staff bearing on the most pressing issues which face India as it moves into the decade of the 1970s. Poverty is undoubtedly the most serious among them. But, on this, the Foundation decided that an effective study could be done only by an Indian scholar and entrusted it to the Indian School of Political Economy. We are publishing the entire study in two instalments. The second instalment will appear in the next issue.]||V. M. Dandekar,Nilakantha Rath

05/6/1971- ||special articles||4382101||NSS and Some Poverty of Economic Methodology Therein||In recent months there has been some recrudescence of interest among Indian economists and statisticians in understanding the magnitude of poverty and the inter-temporal distributional changes in living standards and in incomes. The National Sample Survey reports on consumer expenditure have come into limelight again. Efforts have been made by a host of scholars to extract some operational juice from the published, and unpublished sometimes 'monopolistically' accessible, NSS data and reports. In some of these exercises efforts have been made to build some bridges between the National Income or Accounting data and the NSS data. The findings from these exercises involve very important methodological procedures, the significance of not all of which is recognised or explicitly stated by the 'exercisers'. In view of the country's commitment to abolishing poverty, these exercises are no longer only of academic import. It is necessary to subject the methodological procedures to a severe scrutiny. It is this sort of an effort which is sought to be attempted here. The task of removal of poverty is so important a goal of economic policy that the most accurate of economic thought has to be given to it. Should not a surgeon be equipped with the keenest expertise and the most precise instruments when a major operation has to be conducted on a long-suffering yet faithful patient?||P. R. Brahmananda

04/9/1971- ||special articles||4382472||Rural Unemployment: Measurement for What?||To the dismay of the purists, it has been difficult to provide a precise assessment of the dimensions of rural unemployment in India. But is precise measurement the sine qua non of formulating policy measures designed to begin solving the problem? A pragmatic approach to the estimation of the broad orders of magnitude of rural unemployment, on the basis of available data, is necessary for immediate policy formulation. A more sophisticated estimate of rural unemployment is no doubt welcome for the purposes of long-term planning. Even here, it is not sufficient if the approach is merely disaggregative; it has also to be dynamic. At present the total rural labour force is artificially inflated by the participation of what can be called the "distress labour force". For any secular planning for full employment in the rural sector, this point has to be taken into account.

1/1/1971- ||competitive politics and electoral change||4381547||The Political Change of 1967||This paper deals with the most interesting political question thrown up by the 1967 elections: the change that the elections registered in respect of electoral behaviour which led to a decline of Congress preponderance in the country. An attempt is made to describe this in terms of patterns of regularity and change and the factors responsible for these patterns. The analysis in this paper suggests that the country has entered a more active phase of politics, that the voters are becoming aware of problems of policy and performance and that the appeals that parties make must increasingly be based on concrete items of social and economic change and less and less on either vague manifestoes or reliance on local party organisations and 'vote banks' to deliver the votes no matter what the party appeal is. There are two dimensions of the emerging electoral behaviour in India, one political, the other socio-economic. The first is the development of firm party commitments in the electorate. This is what will give Indian politics its stability and predictability. The other is the dimension of comment on and criticism of the ruling party's performance, discontent with the present and expectations of the future, and judgments regarding a particular party's ability to produce results. Whereas the first may be called the dimension of allegiance, the second may be called the dimension of deliberations. As one influences the other in successive elections, and as particular segments and attitudes get stabilised around this or that party, a still clearer profile of the Indian electorate will emerge with less unpredictability than is the case at present. While the general findings of this paper, on the nature of the political change that 1967 brought about, show large shifts in electoral orientations and awareness, they also reveal considerable stability, loyalty and continuity in the system.||Rajni Kothari

The outcome of the 1967 election has one meaning for the future if the setback suffered by the Congress party was the result of 'peripheral' voters supporting the opposition parties and a totally different meaning if the Opposition successes were built on the support of the politically aware and active segments of the electorate. This paper attempts to stratify the electorate in terms of the degree of involvement in the political and electoral process. The author first looks at the distribution of the electorate by three dimensions of involvement: participation, interest and information. The three dimensions are then combined into a single measure of involvement to stratify the electorate.||Bashiruddin Ahmed

It poses the question: Does the agricultural sector have the capacity to bear additional taxation? An attempt is made to determine the intersectoral tax burden in the state. This is followed by a brief study of the contribution of agriculture to the marginal tax effort. The analysis shows that tax effort in UP has so far been concentrated in the non-agricultural sector. The relative contribution of agriculture to resource mobilisation has been insignificant. The scope for taxation of agriculture is, it emerges from the study, considerable.

This view ignores both the fact that multiple forms of political competition co-exist in communities and other types of social systems in addition to those organised through elections, and the common finding that local and pragmatic interests tend to govern the course of electoral opposition in local communities round the world. The author suggests that in the town in Rajasthan studied by him here, as elsewhere, the institution of elections may play only a secondary part in shaping political values and norms - though elections do provide a convenient 'window' for observation of on-going political processes.||Hugh S.

Standardised values of different variables from the census data are computed using the formula I =$\frac{{\rm x}-\overline{{\rm x}}}{\sqrt{{\rm v}}}$, and correlated with the standardised ranks given by different independent 'judges' based on up-to-date ethnographic accounts in respect of the sample communities, with the help of the formula R = 1 -$\frac{6\ \Sigma \ {\rm d}^{2}}{{\rm N}\ ({\rm N}^{2}-1)}$. The high degree of correlation (.73) found between the two sets of data goes to prove that census data provide useful and reliable characteristics to determine the degree of socio-economic progress aclieved by the Scheduled Tribes.

Though co-operative land development banks have partially met this need, their impact on the farm economy has been far below expectations. This has happened mainly because their credit has not been entirely used for the agreed purposes but has been partially diverted.

No army anywhere is faced with such diverse requirements as ours. In the circumstances, a nominal nuclear weapons programme is more likely to be a liability than an asset. A premature start may only lead to a ruinous situation in which a military industrial complex may get into power. The defence of the nation is emphatically not an isolated problem, and it cannot be the sole responsibility of any one section of our people. Besides, those who accept public responsibility should make an effort to understand the meaning of modern science and technology, the impact they make on social systems, and the implications of it all for our survival and prosperity. Adherence to traditional military concepts in the modern technological age cannot lead to sound defence policies.||B. V. Rangarao

Since no Panchayat area can be treated in isolation from the constituency as a whole, the study covers events in the constituency forming its environment as well as reference to the wider canvas of State politics. An attempt is made to assess the significance of caste and local issues and loyalities in campaign behaviour and voting patterns. It is interesting that the proportion of votes secured by the party candidates at the Assembly elections bears a correspondence to the votes received by candidates of the same parties in the Panchayat elections. Also, caste does not seem to have played an important role in the elections, except perhaps among the Rajputs.

27/3/1971- ||review of agriculture, march 1971||4381798||Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area) Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 1970: A Critical Review||This paper attempts to critically examine the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh (Andhra Area) Tenancy (Amendment) Act, 1970 and analyse the conditions necessary for the success of the Act in the light of studies relating to the implementation of the Andhra Tenancy Act, 1956. Tenancy has become a less important variable to benefit the poorer strata of society since most of the land owned by big resident land owners is now found to be self-cultivated. But even to confer limited benefits to a limited class of the rural poor, the Act needs to be modified considerably. The major directions in which modifications are called for are redefining personal cultivation, fixing the price of land along with giving tenants pre-emptive rights, lowering the ceiling limit for resumptions, not allowing resumptions in the case of non-resident land owners, enabling tenants to retain some land in case of resumptions by owner and applying all the provisions of the legislation to temple lands. Unless the Act is suitably modified along these lines, it will remain another paper tiger.||G. Parthasarathy,K. Suryanarayana Raju

But the Fourth Plan document does not concern itself with the R and D needed in each sector to ensure sectoral growth rates. There is similarly too little attention given to the transfer to technology. Scientists have tended to demand higher outlays for R and D to the neglect of the organisational and financial needs of the technology-transfer process. In fact, following from all this, it seems clear that R and D in India in the next few years will face a full 'identity crisis'. For, the social milieu will offer it neither a convincing role in national development nor any specific hopes. In the circumstances, R and D can be made to become an effective tool of development only if a determined learning process goes on among persons involved in the innovation chain of science and technology. For, only then can the productivity of Indian science begin to show resilience.||R. S. Ganapathy

25/9/1971- ||review of agriculture, september 1971||4382560||Resource Allocation in Indian Agriculture||The so-called New Agricultural Strategy was officially launched in 1965 but actually was quietly under way since 1959, thanks to the report of the Ford Foundation team of experts on "India's Food Crisis". The Fourth Plan relies on the New Strategy for as much as 66 per cent of additional foodgrains output. What is the logical foundation of this strategy under Indian conditions? What are the alternative strategies, if any? In what respect is the New Strategy superior to these others, if at all? These questions have not been even posed, let alone examined. One is thus led to conclude that perhaps India has hardly ever taken such a momentous, far-reaching step, as the New Strategy is, with so little prior analysis. The calculations attempted in this paper of the relative costs per tonne of wheat under two alternative strategies are admittedly crude and, hence, not necessarily conclusive. But the strategy of extending irrigation to hitherto dry land for cultivation with largely traditional methods may be even less expensive than the New Strategy based on 'modern' inputs. It is well known that in India there exists a wide gap between the capacity of an irrigation system and the actual utilisation thereof. No less serious are the malpractices and inefficiency of actual distribution of irrigation water, the lack of drainage and the deficiencies in design of irrigation projects. It is all the more surprising, therefore, that nonetheless the contribution of irrigation water to agricultural productivity in India has been so significant. The New Strategy benefits the relatively big farmers; and its overall impact on small cultivators and landless labourers still remains dubious. It has an inherent tendency to give rise to 'enclave' economies. In the perspective of acute rural poverty and unemployment, this strategy may not turn out to be an unmixed blessing. The entire gamut of resource allocation in Indian agriculture, therefore, calls for a fresh, rigorous scrutiny.||Ranjit K. Sau

Indian agriculture is ruled in general by 'constant returns to scale'. The inverse relationship between size and productivity is perfectly consistent with the three phases of the returns to scale and can be explained simply in terms of the law of variable proportions. The analysis presented here strongly suggests that the explanation for the unremunerativeness of Indian agriculture, as shown by the reported loss in some size-classes of farms, lies not in the valuation of family labour at the ruling wage rate, but in the imputation of a value to owned land. This, along with positive figures of profit observed even in the smallest size-group of holdings, provides ample justification for the valuation of family labour at the ruling wage rate.

The first concerns a reappraisal of the role of planning in facilitating the efficient inter- and intra-temporal allocation of resources. It is necessary to re-state these results of the theory and practice of planning, to attack what is perhaps one of the most important factors retarding growth in India - the shibboleth that planning as conceived in the past, and administrative controls on investment and foreign trade, facilitate rather than hinder efficient growth. The paper's second theme is concerned with equity and more particularly with the concentration of economic power in the hands of the large business families. With the increasing evidence of the inefficiencies of 'old-style' planning, its advocates have retreated into the corner of arguing that it is necessary to maintain some of the old controls for reasons of social justice. It is argued here that this view of the problem of concentration of economic power is misconceived and that the problem should be attacked by more direct measures. A brief and tentative outline of some measures which could be used to tackle this extremely important problem are given. This is not a plea for laissez-faire, but an argument for change in the form of, but not against the need for, government intervention. What is being suggested is that the existing measures are likely to be counter-productive, and that ways are at hand (or can be devised) for securing the objective of growth with social justice more efficiently.||Deepak Lal
1/7/1971- ||politics and performance||4382336||Some Policy Priorities||India can hardly hope to achieve a rapid rate of industrial development so as to eradicate poverty, under-employment and unemployment without first laying the foundations for a sufficiently high net investment in agriculture along with intensive use of land. The development of industry requires a great deal of investment per person. India would need a colossal amount of resources if it tried to shift even 10 per cent of its population from agriculture to industry. With all the massive investment in industry, which makes it an advanced industrial economy, China has probably been able to reduce the percentage of its population engaged in agriculture from about 80 in 1949 to about 75 by now. The inequitous distribution of land - which has been responsible for wasteful use of land and labour and the emergence of a class structure leading to almost negligible net investment in agriculture - has, therefore, to be abandoned in favour of a more even distribution. This must be associated with measures which would bring about rapid increase in area under assured irrigation which would be land-saving. Given our present institutional and other constraints the problem appears to elude a solution. One may, however, use the policy apparatus to create conditions for promoting community use of resources and strengthening the organisations of the weaker sections of society so that they are able to frustrate the collusion between the rich and the bureaucracy, which remains oriented towards the propertied, and to muster the support of the community in favour of radical policy measures.||Pradhan H.

Those engaged in micro-analyses of the judicial decision-making process encounter problems of interpretation of some of their findings. One could question, as a result of their experience, whether the student of cross-national judicial behaviour should undertake micro-analysis of the decision-making process without first engaging in empirical investigation of how a system operates on the cultural or societal level. This type of analysis would make use of propositions drawn from the early impressionistic work, and would, at the same time, lay the groundwork for future micro-analysis. Systems analysis can provide a framework within which to conduct this broad-ranging analysis. An attempt is made in this article to formulate a systems model which can be used as a conceptual tool to analyse the Supreme Court of India, in particular, and other court systems in general.

The planner has to participate in the formulation of this policy and in its implementation in his particular sphere of competence. The urban planner who is engaged in the creation of a varied set of facilities and services for large human aggregates is required to work out the policy implications of broader socio-political-economic goals for housing, zoning, determination of land-use patterns and the provision of social services. This paper has three objectives: (1) to identify the areas of social policy which are of concern to the urban planner; (2) to discuss the problems involved in social policy formulation for urban planning; and (3) to provide tentative answers to problems raised in relation to social policy. The paper does not attempt to list or describe the types of services needed by urban populations. Its object is to consider some of the questions of social policy that face the urban planner in the provision of physical facilities and social services for the residents of the city. In this effort, some of the problems of policy relating to land acquisition, housing, neighbourhood planning and the development of social and welfare services have been reviewed.||M. S. Gore

28/8/1971- ||review of management, august 1971||4382438||Approaches to Project Evaluation||The theoretical literature on cost-benefit analysis has grown in volume as well as in perception. Little and Mirrlees, for instance, have developed a full-fledged, novel approach in this respect, on the foundation laid by Jan Tinbergen. Simultaneously, another approach has been taking shape in the contributions of a number of economists among which Sen's and Marglin's are perhaps the most outstanding. These are the two distinct, dominant trends of thinking on the question of project evaluation. What we propose to do in this paper is to present a slightly different, simpler model of cost-benefit analysis. As it turns out in this scheme, the shadow price of labour is a redundant concept for the purpose of project evaluation where consumption is taken to be the major objective. Another interesting feature is that the cut-off rate of return for public investment varies with the project's economic life as well as with the choice of technique. In other words, the appropriate discount rate need not be uniform for all projects. In view of the current debate in certain socialist countries as to whether or not the marginal rate of return should differ among branches of investment, this particular finding of our model is of theoretical as well as practical significance.||Ranjit K.

In his speech while presenting the interim budget, the Finance Minister had spoken of the need to continue the task of enlarging the tax base which, according to him, had been initiated in last year's budget. It is argued in this paper that if the Finance Minister is genuinely committed to taking some positive measures for enlarging the tax base with a view to bringing about better distribution of income and wealth and thereby securing social justice for the weaker sections of the community, he must (i) derecognise completely the Hindu Undivided Family for purposes of taxation; (ii) take proper legislative and administrative measures to ensure that non-agricultural income cannot, in any circumstances, be passed off as agricultural income for tax purposes; and (iii) revoke all exemptions now granted on various types of personal savings and at the same time revert to the system of personal deductions in place of initial exemptions.

If the new system which replaces it is to avoid recurrence of situations similar to the one now being faced, it must never again give the key currency role to any national currency or even a group of national currencies. Instead it must be based on an international reserve which is created and can be expanded to meet expanding world requirements under genuinely international auspices. Unless the underdeveloped countries are alert to the present goings on among the developed countries, certain basic decisions might be taken with regard to the new world monetary system without their interests and requirements being sufficiently taken into account. What the underdeveloped countries must aim at is to secure an agreement that any secular expansion in international reserves would be allocated exclusively to them. They should never again settle for allocation in the manner of SDRs which was retrograde, regressive and inequitable. [The views expressed in this paper are the author's personal views.]||I. S.

28/8/1971- ||special articles||4382446||General Elections of 1967 in a Small UP Town||This study shows quite clearly that voting patterns in a small UP town were largely influenced by caste and economic considerations. Caste Hindus voted in favour of the Congress and Jan Sangh candidates because they expected one of these parties to win the election. They wished to be on the side of the winner so that they could draw the benefits and patronage which accrue from positions of power. Another reason for this preference could be that even though the Congress and Jan Sangh candidates belonged to the Scheduled Castes, the parties themselves were not considered Scheduled Caste parties. Locally, the Jan Sangh was considered to be a party representing the business class which, as far as the town was concerned, was mainly Vaish. Likewise, the Congress was considered to be a party representing generally the upper castes and the richer sections of the town's population. Compared to this, the Harijan (independent) and the Republican candidates were clearly identified as the candidates of the Harijans and the Jatavas respectively. The reason why the Scheduled Castes did not contest the elections as a single group may be the fact that the town being part of a reserved constituency, the election of a Scheduled Caste member was assured ipso facto. There was thus no compulsion to suppress the intra-caste tensions which prevailed among the two groups of Scheduled Castes. They could freely assert their separate caste identities even at the risk of splitting their voting strength and yet have no apprehensions about a non-Scheduled Caste member getting elected. The caste rivalries between the Jatavas and the Harijans - which the elections in this constituency enhanced further - highlight the fact that reserved constituencies tend to itensify caste tensions among that very section of the depressed population for whose very benefit the reservation of constituencies has been provided for in the Constitution. This may sound a sweeping generalisation, but the study supports it amply, howsoever inadequate the representativeness of the town studied may be.

1/1/1971- ||development theory revisited||4381560||Performance and Aid Allocation||Familiarity in aid, as in most human relationships, has bred cynicism-if not contempt. A particularly unedifying example of this is the suggestion sometimes made that developed countries have become interested in the performance of developing countries as an excuse for not giving aid. Historically, it is true that the period of greatest activity in performance evaluation has coincided with a period of relative stagnation in aid-that is, the decade of the sixties. However, the reasons for the growing clamour for 'performance' are somewhat more subtle and are to be found in the history of aid, its changing rationale and the reorganisation of aid that has taken place in the last decade. The question of criteria for the evaluation of allocative performance can be resolved only if there is agreement on: (i) the objective of aid, and (ii) the weight that should be given to performance (as defined by that objective) in the allocation of aid. If this view is correct, it would seem that a political consensus on aid is more relevant to the question of choice of criteria than technical sophistication in constructing indices of self-help or effort. The issue is not whether the criteria should be technical or political-all technical solutions are based on some value judgments-but whether these value judgments are explicit and internationally shared, or implicit and subjective. Unfortunately, not much attention has been given to this aspect of the question in international discussions. Unless the developing countries can take a lead, there is at least a chance that the matter will be resolved for them by development experts and the aid bureaucracy. And that would be a pity.||Bimal Jalan

It estimates net national output from the expenditure approach for the period 1958-59 to 1968-69. As the current estimates are based on data of better quality, coverage and authenticity, they are surer estimates of private income and net national product. But the percentage of error cannot be categorically stated. However, despite the drawbacks owing to the nature of the basic data utilised, there is striking comparative closeness between the net national product series estimated by the National Sample expenditure data and the official national income estimates. The series, therefore, reliably give an idea of the general trend. [Y C Bhatnagar and Girdhar Gopal helped greatly in data collection. But the views expressed are entirely those of the author.]||S.

The Hindus opposition to the Sikhs soon turned into opposition to the Congress party as it was identified as the agency that had conceded the Punjabi Suba's demand for partition. This paper is concerned with the election process in BG camp, one of the 15 wards of the city of Jullunder Assembly constituency. The camp is populated mainly by Harijans - mostly Meghs who are also members of Arya Samaj. The Meghs have been given the status of scheduled castes. Their traditional support for the Congress was reinforced at the 1967 elections by their status as a scheduled caste. However, they were in a dilemma because of the Arya Samaj's decision to boycott the Congress. They thus had to choose between Arya Samaj and the Congress. The election results showed the Meghs' clear preference for the Congress. The most important factor which influenced their electoral behaviour was their scheduled caste status. They were acutely aware of the distinctions separating them from the caste Hindus - even among the Arya Samajists - and they felt that their social position rather than their sectarian affiliation should decide their choice of political party.||Veena Dua

But their wish to secede from what was a nation not so long ago has, it seems, evoked ambivalent feelings among nationalists. The unease is especially noticeable in India, which became an independent nation at the same time as Pakistan. It will be a shame if this confusion leads Indian nationalism to betray itself. For the struggle of Bangla Desh is not only a nationalist struggle; it is an anti-colonial struggle such as the people of this country fought in the first half of this century. In Section I of this paper, we shall describe the working of colonialism, taking for the purpose the example of British colonialism in our own country. In Section II, we shall describe how East Bengal turned from a partner into a colony of West Pakistan. In Section III, we shall outline the colonial benefits to West Pakistan from the occupation of East Bengal.||Ashok V. Desai

Reports from the scene indicate otherwise. There seem to have been no contingency plans at all in case Yahya decided to crush Bangla Desh by force, and resistance to the West Pakistan troops in those early days of March and April was almost non-existent. Why did Sheikh Mujib and the Awami League not include some plan for the worst? It is the thesis of this paper that they did not because the whole chain of events that took place in March of 1971 repeated almost exactly a similar sequence from March of 1969. Everything must have looked almost the same to Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in early and mid-March of 1971 as it did two years previously. As to the immediate future, imposition of martial law, forced cessation of political activity, and even a few firings on protesting mobs of students and workers had become the standard fare of politics in East Pakistan, after all, and would only set things back for awhile. After the hiatus, there would be time enough for continuing the Awami League drive for autonomy. In any event, the election showed that the League was uncontestably the will of the Bengali people, a will that would surely in the end prevail. Preparations, then, were not made for what to do in case the army wanted to do more than merely keep order. But instead of reimposed martial law came cataclysm.||Harry W. Blair

The Schumpeterian school has postulated a positive relationship between absolute and relative size of firm, the level of R&D activity and technological progress. The proposition examined here is that size of firm (absolute and relative) is an essential determinant of R&D activity on an effective scale in Indian industry. This proposition is split into the following working hypotheses to guide our empirical inquiry: (a) that R&D effort is greater in large than in small (medium) firms; and (b) that firms with higher market power (relative size) spend relatively a higher proportion of their turnover on R&D. We propose to seek empirical evidence in respect of these hypotheses by examining variations in R&D expenditure among sample firms in the chemical industry.||K. K. Subrahmanian

However careful and sympathetic one might be, a reading of the chapter on agriculture in the Plan cannot but give the feeling that the exercise of target-setting has been carried out more in the spirit of forecasting than in that of predicting. One cannot avoid the feeling that the targets are not at all based on any firm understanding of the internal dynamics of the growth that is taking place in agriculture. They represent mere extrapolation of certain very short duration trends. The Plan bases its projections on the successful completion of a green revolution which it takes for granted; it does not incorporate any guidelines for conducting the revolution along any desired path.||Ashok Rudra

For one thing, for the first time since Independence the very consolidation of the political system was decided by reference to the ballot box. Secondly, such a fundamental political issue was posed and decided by reference to a clear commitment to policy goals; for the first time a party in government went to the people for a 'mandate' based on a socio-economic programme to which it said it was itself committed. The 1971 election in this respect marks a watershed in the nature and style of Indian politics. This has clear and far-reaching implications for the policy process, for leadership and for administration. Among other things, it poses the dilemma of how to bring about basic discontinuities in political and administrative functioning in a democratic set-up whose style and ethos are incremental rather than catastrophic. It can be done - and perhaps done better and more rationally in a democracy - provided the basic message gets home and the temptation to slip back into general complacency and hackneyed cliches is held in check. It is equally necessary to hold in check the tendency - all too prominent so far in our planning and management of public affairs - to contract out the main tasks to one-way experts whose competence in their own narrow fields of specialisation is matched by an almost total ignorance of the socio-political context in which they operate. The needed decisions in respect of policy choices and priorities must be made by the top policy elite itself. With the unequivocal result of the election the national scene has shifted from the constituencies to the legislatures and even more to the ministries and the secretariats. It is a shift from the game of politics to the interstices of planning and administration.||Rajni Kothari

But, in fact, its progress has been far slower than expected, and slower in kharif than in rabi. This article maintains that economic variables have been far more important determinants of that pace than is often realised. Section I of the article examines data on trends in progress and varietal changes in relation to Andhra Pradesh. Section II identifies and compares the role of the economic variables with that of the agronomic and climatic variables in the slow progress in kharif.||G. Parthasarathy,D. S. Prasad

Towards this objective, production at the all-India level must increase at a rate to match corresponding overall needs. Even so, regional problems will exist. Growth in production will be uneven among the States and will cause regional imbalances. The dimensions of India's future food problem must also be measured, therefore, from the angle of the regional imbalances in demand and supply. In this paper, an attempt is made to estimate the emerging pattern of regional imbalance, under the assumption that, at the all-India level, future production of the different foodgrains will equal domestic needs. The 15-year time-horizon considered, 1969-70 to 1983-84, covers the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Plans. The regional growth rates of demand for foodgrains are estimated in Part I. In Part II the prospects of meeting the foodgrains demand through indigenous production are examined. Part III estimates the regional growths in foodgrains production during the 15-year period-on the assumption that at the all-India level production of various foodgrains will equal their respective demands. Part IV considers the problems and requirements of foodgrains management which will arise out of the instability of production and the regional imbalances.

02/10/1971- ||special articles||4382598||Soviet View of the Treaty: Non-Alignment Plus?||The Soviet view seems to be that non-aligned countries can still play a purposeful role in the newly emerging world power structure, provided they are backed by institutionalised relations with the Soviet Union, as distinct from the traditional Soviet support given to them in the past. This 'non-alignment plus' (i e, non-alignment plus institutional ties with the USSR), as between the three poles of the world power structure, might well eventually emerge as the final pattern of Soviet policy towards the 'Third World'. But we do not know for sure yet. Much will depend on the final Soviet attitude to China's claim in the super power stakes and the Soviet rating of 'viable' and 'non-viable' countries in Asia. The Indo-Soviet Treaty could, therefore, prove to be either an exception or a trend-setter. It is also necessary to grasp two ideological imperatives behind Soviet foreign policy in order to fully understand Soviet behaviour in world affairs. One is the Soviet preoccupation with the mechanism of social change within various countries and the other is the Soviet framework of looking at international politics as a confrontation between two systems - the world capitalist system and the world socialist system. The first imperative explains why no government, other than the Soviet one, could have so seriously taken into account the importance of a favourable balance of social forces in India and the dynamic of Indian social change, before signing the Treaty.||Zafar Imam

There are, however, serious drawbacks in the work programmes of these organisations as well as in their staffing patterns and inter-relations (or rather lack of inter-relations) which result in the yields from these investments being extremely low. This paper seeks to discuss some of these problems with respect to the two most important schemes sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture, namely those of the Agro-Economic Research Centres and the Farm Management Surveys.||Ashok Rudra

India's foreign policy was found to be the most salient aspect of this image while perceptions of India's population and political leaders were few. Yet, evaluations of the Indian people and leaders were discovered to be far more positive than evaluations of either India's foreign policy or domestic circumstances. Generally the US Administration expressed more favourable views of India's foreign relations, domestic conditions, leaders and people than the US Congress. The divergence of views between the Congress and the Administration is most pronounced as regards economic and social conditions within India - especially the latter. Over the time-span, 1951-67, 55 per cent of US decision-makers' statements on India dealt with its international relations. Approximately 42 per cent of the themes were devoted to the domestic situation in India. Only 2.8 per cent of the remarks involved generalised comment about "the people" and mentions of India's political leaders by name.||Joanne F. Loomba

08/5/1971- ||special articles||4381975||Estimation of Tax Incidence in India||Estimation of tax incidence is important as it generally constitutes the basis for formulations of tax policy. In recent years attempts have been made, official as well as unofficial, to estimate the incidence of taxation in India. The purpose has been to obtain a quantitative basis for examining equity in taxation in India-particularly as between the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors and as among the different income-groups within these sectors. An examination of these studies reveals several conceptual and empirical shortcomings which become particularly serious for estimates of equity in incidence among the different income groups. Moreover, there is generally an oversimplification in them of assumptions made about the process of tax-shifting. While these studies attempt to measure tax incidence via the consumption approach, the possibility of arriving at a measure to serve the same purpose through a production approach needs to be explored. The studies have especially failed to fill one lacuna. Despite the pious pronouncements regarding equity in the Plans, taxation of the agricultural sector continues to be sadly neglected; the various studies have, nevertheless, failed to provide any objective basis for vertical equity in taxation of the agricultural sector.||K.

The assumption has been that it is the intermediaries who have been pocketing the extra money paid by the consumer. This article tries to find out how the gains from rising prices have in fact been divided among farmer, mill, wholesaler and retailer. It is important to know this, for, if a squeeze is applied it may be absorbed by the intermediaries only if their margins have widened by the extent of the price increases. The analysis indicates that it is the miller who has gained continuously throughout this period, gaining during 1965-66 to 1967-68 even at the cost of the farmer, the wholesaler of groundnut and the retailer of groundnut oil.

While it does not formulate plans at the commodity level, it has selected policy instruments which operate largely at that level. This policy of extremely heterogeneous and ad hoc favours to exporters cannot be said to have been a dazzling success, looking at the growth of exports. But it is difficult to say why it has not worked unless one looks at its effects at the micro level. This is what we propose to do in the present paper. For this purpose we have selected an industry the growth of whose exports is highly impressive. But as we shall show, the growth has been achieved in spite of rather than because of government policy.||Ashok V. Desai

The tendency has been to stress the sociological factors such as caste or religion or to blame the policies of the British government for the backwardness of the country. The contention of this paper is that this approach, while it provides useful insights, gives a lopsided explanation, and that a new line of inquiry would suggest a re-evaluation of the development of Indian entrepreneurship. Empiricial data points to the fact that cultural and religious forms are re-interpreted in real life under the weight of changes in the material environment. The so-called Hindu value system transformed itself to permit the entry of non-business classes into industrial ventures, when the new economic opportunities were perceived and grasped by these classes. Indeed, if entrepreneurship is the response to the disequilibrium between the perceivable opportunities and their exploitation at any point of time, then a study of the constellation of forces which led to the perception of new opportunities by certain sections of society, might yield more satisfactory results.||Dwijendra Tripathi

13/2/1971- ||special articles||4381616||Local Government Roots of Contemporary Indian Politics||Recent studies of contemporary Indian politics consistently suggest that in style and structure it is a variety of what is called in the West 'interest group democracy'. In the open society that was established after Independence by adopting a constitution which enfranchised all adult members of the population and empowered parliamentary bodies to govern according to majority rule, political parties were motivated to mobilise followers through championing the interests of the various ascriptive segments into which the population resolved itself. In addition, the special circumstances produced by essentially one-party rule at the national level for more than two decades, and its equivalent in most provincial polities, added still another dimension to the interest-group orientation of Indian politics. The relative absence of inter-party competition can place a premium on rivalries and adjustments among less formalised intra-party groups or 'factions'. The Indian political system in post-Independence times thus became a series of arenas governed by rules inspired by Western parliamentary idioms. The principal participants are political parties and factions vying for control of legislative bodies and for access to scarce material and symbolic resources, on behalf of complex and highly fluid clienteles. It is a state of affairs which Western political scientists find unsurprising in modern democratic polities but which Indian political commentators deplore due to the high expectations they have had for the achievements of their political system. It is suggested in this paper that Indian politics as observed since Independence is not a case of degeneration from a halcyon age when idealism, purity of heart and high statesmanship pervaded political life. This is an image of Indian politics evoked through paying almost exclusive attention to the deeds and conclaves of the topmost levels of the political elite to the virtual exclusion of what was going on for almost a century in localised political settings. The author argues that crucial aspects of the styles and forms of Indian politics which emerged after Independence were evolved in hundreds of local political bodies - viz, town, municipal and district boards - because it was here alone that the British first allowed significant numbers of ordinary citizens to play anything like serious roles.||Harold A.

20/11/1971- ||special articles||4382772||Interest Sensitiveness of Deposits in India||On the assumption that both demand and supply play a role in determining the price and quantity of the commodity in question, a study of interest sensitiveness of deposits must consider both the demand and the supply of deposits. Deposits may be said to be supplied by banks and demanded by the non-bank private sector. Since, in India, banks always honour deposits and deposits constitute by far the major source of funds through which banks make profit, and since depositors merely choose between different kinds of deposits by their liquidity/saving motives in the belief that they have no influence on the interest rate, it is assumed here that banks determine the interest rate and terms and conditions on deposits, and on these terms they then supply an unlimited quantity of deposits to meet the demand from depositors. The hypothesis is that at a given interest rate depositors demand a given amount of deposits and that their demand varies with the variation on the interest rate on deposits. This paper sets out to find out, by estimating demand functions for deposits, the interest sensitiveness of deposits in India. It posits that there is in fact a significant positive correlation between the two.

27/11/1971- ||review of management, november 1971||4382802||Corporate Policies on Bonus Share Issues in India||Bonus issues in India are in the nature of 'stock-splits' rather than 'stock-dividends'. Increases in the total quantum of dividend distribution do not follow bonus issues quite as universally or automatically as is generally assumed. In fact, where dividend distribution has been increased, the quantum of increase has been usually less than in proportion to the bonus issue. This paper is based on the findings of a specific inquiry. It argues from its findings that both to counteract the tendency towards laxity and wastefulness in the investment of retained earnings and to check undesirable speculation, a policy of an annual 'stock-dividend' paid concurrently with the retention of profits has distinct advantages over the present practice in India. The current practice amounts to capitalising past accumulations at infrequent and irregular intervals according to the whim of managements.

22/5/1971- ||special articles||4382032||Planning for Performance in Banks||Planning, co-ordination and control of an enterprise above a size gets beyond the scope of any individual or group of individuals at the top. It then becomes necessary for the management process to rely on concepts of scientific management. This has not happened even in the big banks; as a result, banks have tended to develop into spongy organisations where pressure applied at any point diminishes as it travels through the different organisational levels, each level acting as a sponge to absorb some of the pressure. The present planning process in banks perpetuates this situation. In the best of situations business planning after a fashion takes place at the Head Office. At the start of the year, the Chief Executive decides that the bank should increase its deposits by 'x' per cent. This is arrived at by extrapolating the historical rate of accretion of deposits in the bank and the banking system as a whole. As a measure of bankers' abundant caution, a cushion is added before the target figure of increase by 'x' per cent is arrived at. This is then distributed among the regional heads of the bank. The regional heads in turn distribute the target to the branches under their control. Business planning in banks has, as a result, lacked a disciplined methodology, a logical system and a precise definition of terms. There is no resource planning relating to branch expansion programmes. Every new branch is opened in a crisis. Planning for deposits and advances is also limited to what needs to be done and not how plans are to be achieved. This paper discusses the application of an integrated approach towards performance planning in banks.||Kalyan Banerji

In the context of India's plural society, in which the long continuity and stability of multiple traditional cultures makes the unified democratic experiment anyhow more complicated, the task of harmonising the particular and exclusive demands of minorities with the nation's general processes of change becomes all the more perilous. If only for this reason a study of minority politics in all its ramifications acquires a certain primacy for construction of relevant hypotheses of India's functional politics. Of all the minorities, the Muslims occupy a distinctive place in Indian politics for many reasons: because of their proportion in the population which makes them the single biggest minority; because of their historical role, cultural contribution, social distinctiveness and urban and semi-urban habitation contrasted with their present cultural bewilderment, social degeneracy, educational decline and economic backwardness; and because of their sense of political despair so unwisely perpetuated by the existence of exclusivistic non-secular, uncreative and inept leadership. For a clearer understanding of Indian politics, no less than for a better appreciation of the Muslim response to the processes of secularisation and modernisation in India, systematic studies of Muslim politics under different situations and conditions and in different parts and regions of the country are called for. This paper studies the traditional leadership situation among Muslims in a major urban political centre of Muslims, the city of Hyderabad in Andhra Pradesh. The paper is published in two parts. In this, the first, part the author examines the process of communal polarisation in Hyderabad city politics in successive elections and discusses the traditional Muslim parties in Hyderabad and their leaderships. The second part of the paper, to be published next week, will study certain major aspects of the Muslim problem in Hyderabad and seek to suggest a framework for understanding communal polarisation.||Rasheeduddin Khan

The two features of the Indian economy that have shaped the nature of the market as it exists now are (a) the direct and dominant role of the Government in the total investment outlays of the economy, and (b) Government ownership of the major financial institutions. The commercial banks, the Life Insurance Corporation and the Provident Funds own between them 85 per cent of the Government debt held by the public and all these are either state-owned or under statutory control regarding their investment policy. The investment policy of these institutions becomes part of the allocation of resources between the public (Government) and private sectors. Viewed from this angle, the statutory restrictions imposed on these institutions on their investments takes on a new character. The rate offered on bonds is not strictly competitive. However, with the increase in the resources of the major financial institutions the public debt has been growing at the rate of 7 per cent per annum. There is no active secondary market for bonds and even in relation to the limited transactions, the Reserve Bank of India plays an important role by supporting bond prices. Perhaps in the Indian context even the need for an active secondary market may be questioned. With the major subscribers of Government securities under direct control of the state it is possible for the Government to keep the bond yield below 'competitive' level. There is, however, a limit to which the Government can insulate the rates on bonds from other rates in the market without seriously eroding the profitability of the financial institutions. In the absence of a market, the financial institutions may face a problem regarding the allocation of funds between different State Government securities. Here again, the problem becomes a part of the general question of allocation of resources between Central and State Governments, rather than being purely a matter of the investment policy of a financial institution.||C.

25/9/1971- ||special articles||4382568||Unemployment and Brain Drain||Unemployment and the brain drain necessarily co-exist in a developing country. Both reflect non-utilisation of human resources. Unemployment may be termed internal brain drain, while losing qualified personnel to foreign countries constitutes external brain drain. Any desire or plan to stem the brain drain is obviously not motivated simply by a desire to hold people within the political boundaries of the home country. If it were so, the solution could be very simple. Unemployment and migration of personnel become problems only in the context of work which has to be done and tasks which remain to be accomplished in the country. The potential contribution of the utilised work force need to be considered in planning for national reconstruction. While Government has been anxious to obtain a correct account of the unemployment among scientific and technical personnel at home and of those who have chosen to live abroad, there has been too much emphasis on trying to improve the estimates and to perfect the statistics. But there is no reason why plans of action cannot be evolved on the basis of information already available. And the country does have working statistics for the purpose.||Kamalesh Ray

By making life fast and more complicated, industrialisation in India, too, is giving rise to problems of mental health. The problem requires understanding and anticipation, but its analysis is difficult since there is not much data on mental morbidity. The age-sex, and crude distribution of mental patients can be of great help in evaluating the extent of the problem in a given population. This article is based on a study of these rates among hospitalised patients in Maharashtra, and discusses the likely causes of the differences that emerge from the results.||Satish Kumar Kalra

But if one looks into the details of the initial conditions of Pakistan's development - in terms of factor endowments, resource position or growth potential - one cannot seriously maintain that it was in the nature of things that West Pakistan would come to dominate the East or that a different set of policies could not have achieved quite a different pattern of regional development. Between 1947 and 1950, the total regional income of East Pakistan was almost certainly higher than that of West Pakistan. One cannot, therefore, explain the subsequent growth of regional disparity in terms of initial differences in the infrastructure of the two parts of Pakistan. This article, which studies the growth of regional disparity in Pakistan, is published in two parts. In this, the first part, the author examines available evidence on the growth of disparities between West and East Pakistan. The second part of the article, to be published next week, will present some hypotheses to explain the growth of disparity with the purpose of isolating the factors that contributed the most.||Arjun Sengupta

It argues that the most important proximate cause of the disparities in growth of crop-output during 1952-53 to 1964-65 is the differences in growth of irrigation. It was public investment that played a major role in bringing about this growth in irrigation, private investment having been mostly confined to well irrigation. It is also argued that private investment itself is high where public subsidies and loans are easily forthcoming and where rainfall is scanty and fluctuating. It is doubtful, according to the author, whether the ability to save is an important factor in explaining inter-regional differentials in private investments in irrigation or the growth of crop-output. Since rich farmers also happen to be concentrated in the better-off areas, they have been able to induce greater public investments in irrigation in their regions. Consequently, with the growth of irrigation, the inter-regional disparities as well as the hiatus between the rich and poor farmers have widened. [I have benefited from discussions with Amiya Bagchi, Sukumoy Chakravarty, M V Posner, Amit Bhaduri, P Venkatramaiah and Arul in writing this paper.

To meet this demand indigenously, significant investments in the petroleum industry have been planned and their locations have been settled. Some preliminary results of an optimising exercise for the industry indicate, however, that there are better alternatives open to the economy. The programming exercise, this article argues, needs to take into account three questions (a) how much crude should be refined at each of the locations and what should be the flow pattern of products from supply points to demand points; (b) should some products be nevertheless imported and, if yes, how much of each product through the various ports; (c) how should the limited technological flexibility in refining operations be used to make the yield pattern more or less conform to the demand pattern. Tentative results which have been obtained indicate that policy decisions that have been made may not yield the best possible pattern of solutions and that there is a case, therefore, for obtaining more systematic findings before committing the new investment.||Ramesh K.

What our people are asking for at present are three things. Firstly, they want the right to enter university as a kind of universal human right. Secondly, they want assured progress up the ladder once they are on it. Thirdly, they want assured employment of some non-manual kind at the end of their turn at university. No amount of what is called student participation in the process of university government can secure them these things. Furthermore student participation in this sense cannot solve the deeper problem of colonialised self-estrangement in our intellectual culture, any more than it can solve the problem of educated unemployment in our national economic life. Nevertheless there is everything to be said for student participation in university organisation, government and management. It will not cure our student unrest, but it might hopefully channel some of it into improving our university system.||Jit Singh Uberoi

This raises basic questions concerning the goals of planning and policies over the next decade or two. The questions may appear deceptively simple and may, therefore, be dismissed as trite. But adequate answers to them are crucial to a determination of the goals of development for the seventies and to an elaboration of policies to achieve them. In particular, the following questions are examined in this article: (i) What is new in the post-1971 election scene in India? What is the meaning of the mandate for the Congress? After all, the Congress has gained about the same majority as in some earlier elections under Nehru. Should the mandate be therefore regarded as simply a continuation of the past, or a 'new' one? (ii) If the mandate is new, how does it affect the main lines of our planning since early fifties? Does the new mandate require a major change in the goals and policies we have been pursuing so far? Or is only a slight modification all that is called for? (iii) If there is need for a substantial change, what could be its main direction? Each of these questions is taken up in turn. It is concluded that the mandate is a new one; that it requires outstanding changes in goals and policies; and that their main direction should be an orderly transition towards socialism over the next two decades. The approach throughout is not to provide detailed technical answers, but to point to the central thrust required by them. Once the political decisions concerning the central thrust have been made, it should be possible to initiate the necessary technical work for their implementation.

18/9/1971- ||special articles||4382527||Depreciation and Current Repairs in Income-Accounting: Independent or Interdependent?||Income computation for tax purposes is supposed to allow for all expenditure incurred in earning it so that the incidence of tax falls on income only and not on any of the capital investment. An important component of these expenses is the 'user cost' of the capital employed in depreciable assets. Thus the depreciation allowance has to be adequate so as to enable the tax-payer to maintain his capital intact. The computation of the right amount for such an allowance is not an easy task, since there are insuperable problems in the measurement of the changes in capital values as well as of the exact annual wear and tear. Thus the need to deduct expenses, on account of maintenance or repairs of equipment, for working out the true income per year over and above the allowance for depreciation, arises essentially from the inadequacy of the depreciation rule to take account of the economic decay of the asset during the year. Since in a tax system based on 'realisation' rather than 'accrual' expediency and not equity has to be the justification for depreciation, the allowance for repairs has also to be on the same basis. The two allowances, of depreciation and for repairs, have to be tied in a manner such that the book value of the depreciated assets reflects their market worth faithfully at all relevant points of time. This is no easy task either, but it has to be attempted. In fact, however, legal interpretations for maintenance allowance have always been excessively liberal, defying the underlying economic logic for allowing such deductions.||A. Bagchi

1/1/1971- ||development theory revisited||4381558||India's Industrialisation Strategy||In India as in some other developing countries, a period of rapid and sustained economic growth in manufacturing production has been followed by a recession and slower growth. This slowing down has been generally associated with a narrowing of the scope for easy import substitution, a more difficult balance of payments situation, and an increasing discontent with the social and income effects of the industrialisation. Following all this, several of these countries have tried to reorientate their industrial strategies, chiefly by seeking to develop exports of manufactures and more generally by seeking to create conditions in which a more competitive and cost-conscious industry will develop. It is recognised that if industry is to grow much faster than the national output - i e, if it is to be the 'lead sector' in growth - it can only do so by breaking into export markets. Fortunately for India, the slackening in her rate of growth has not been reflected in the rate of growth of her non-traditional exports of manufactures. Nevertheless, export-led growth may not fully materialise unless the manufacturing sector is made more flexible and competitive and the raw material shortages that have hindered it are overcome. What is required, according to this article, is not the direct controls over investment, imports, and allocation and prices of industrial materials, which have been used till now, as these have failed to achieve the ends for which they were designed, but a system of indirect controls working by means of taxes and subsidies through the market mechanism. While the process of transition to this system would be difficult, it could be eased and speeded up by foreign aid, and its end result would be greater independence with less need to rely on aid in the future. [This article represents an attempt by one of the authors of the recently published OECD study "Industry and Trade in Some Developing Countries" to expound its relevance to India at the present time. The study mentioned was based on a series of simultaneously prepared country studies, including a large volume on India by Jagdish Bhagwati and Padma Desai.]||M. Fg. Scott
09/1/1971- ||special articles||4381515||Poverty in India-II: Policies and Programmes||At the root of the prevailing inequalities in income is the inequitable distribution of the means of production. The communist solution to the problem is to socialise all means of production and ensure a socially equitable distribution of income. If this is ruled out, as it seems to have been ruled out, the other alternative is to distribute equitably the means of production themselves. A major means of production in the Indian economy is land. Therefore, a suggested remedy to the problem of poverty is to redistribute available land among all those who depend upon it. But there is not enough land to redistribute so that every one may employ himself on his land and earn a minimum desirable living. It also does not appear to be a solution which can be maintained in the face of economic forces operating in an economy in which the means of production are privately owned. Lastly, if the solution is perforce maintained over a period, it may lead Indian agriculture into conditions of stagnation. The other means of production are those employed in other than agricultural production, which we may call industrial capital. This too is in short supply and is very unequally distributed. Therefore, a suggested remedy to the problem of unemployment is to adopt a labour-intensive technology which with the available amount of capital will provide employment to all. Unfortunately, the khadi programme of the Khadi and Village Industries Commission provides ample evidence that it is not a feasible solution. Hence, if an equitable distribution of the means of production is not feasible or desirable, the problem of poverty and unemployment revolves on the question whether the vast numbers of persons with no means of production of their own can at all be put to productive work so that they may contribute to the national product and earn a share in it. The Planning Commission has dismissed this entire question on the ground that no precise estimates of unemployment or under-employment are available or can indeed be made meaningfully. But if a major reason for rural poverty is unemployment or underemployment, additional employment worth Rs 800 crores to Rs 1,000 crores annually will be needed to lift everybody, except the poorest 10 per cent, above the poverty line. This is the measure of unemployment and under-employment in the country. No greater precision is needed if anybody wants to do anything about it. This is the burden of poverty and the richer sections must bear it. A 15 per cent cut in the consumer expenditure of the richest 5 per cent and a 7.5 per cent cut in the consumer expenditure of the 5 per cent rich below them is all that is needed. The burden is not great if the rich will see the reason. It is essential that they agree to bear it if a solution to the problem of poverty is to be found within the framework of private property. [This study was prepared by the Indian School of Political Economy, Poona, under a contract from the Ford Foundation. The Ford Foundation has recently released a number of studies prepared by its own research staff bearing on the most pressing issues which face India as it moves into the decade of the 1970s. Poverty is undoubtedly the most serious among them. But, on this, the Foundation decided that an effective study could be done only by an Indian scholar and entrusted it to the Indian School of Political Economy. We are publishing the entire study in two instalments. The first instalment appeared in the last issue.]||V. M. Dandekar,Nilakantha Rath

This has been made possible by the relatively rapid build-up of the educational system. And it has all been supported mainly by the requirements and rewards of industrial economies for literate, knowledgeable, and skilled labour forces working away from home and family, and also the aspiration that democratic citizens should be informed and responsible. One result, in India, of political capacity (in the sense of the ability to make demands effectively within the political system) outstripping economic capacity (in the sense of the economy's ability to supply resources) has been the creation of a relatively large educational sector. In India, and in some other new and industrialising nations, modern educational institutions have created the new political class of youth prior to, or parallel with, the emergence of other modern political classes such as the middle and working classes. In consequence, this political class and particularly its vanguard, the students, has a significance in the politics of these countries uncharacteristic of the political change process in Europe and America during comparable periods of their democratisation and industrialisation. Given the special significance of students in the politics of many new nations, certain questions assume importance and interest. These are: whether or not their politics are like national politics and integrated with them; whether student politics are separate from, opposed to, or ahead of, national politics; and what conditions promote one or another of these tendencies. The relationship of student politics to national politics can range between the poles of congruence and incongruence, and student politics can be assessed within this range by reference to goals and methods in the categories: Ideological; Regime; Programmatic/Party; Interest; and Issue. Such an analysis of student politics in India is carried out in this article. While the findings do not tell us at what point, historically, students may become a political class, they do illuminate those factors in the college environment that are likely to incline students toward adhering or not adhering to their role as students, and throw light on those conditions that, in India, have been associated with student unrest and a readiness for activity as a political class.

For this, scientists must be made to feel committed to organisational goals. This cannot be done just by changing the organisational system or providing more facilities. It is necessary to study the factors that influence scientists' commitment to organisational goals. In this paper are presented the results of such a study for India.||S. P. Gupta,K. D. Sharma,A.

In defining these requirements, however, two different approaches are possible. Their divergence stems from a divergence of views on the exact relationship between education and economic development. The first view considers education as one of the inputs in the production system, the supply of which has therefore to be equated to the demand derived from the size of the production and the technology adopted for it. Integration of the educational and economic plans thus involves working out the probable manpower requirements of the planned production system and structuring the educational system to meet these requirements. This may be called the 'manpower requirements approach'. The second view regards the first as a fallacious reversal of the relationship. Since a given level of output presupposes the existence of a certain amount of education and since economic development follows educational development, economic development cannot be a limiting factor in deciding educational expansion. In fact, education contributes to a dynamic economy in ways that have nothing directly to do with vocational preparation. Hence education should not be planned merely by the manpower requirements of planned production but on the basis of the educational needs of the population as a whole. Seeking to take into consideration the economic, social and cultural needs of the society, this may be described as the 'cultural approach'. The implications of these two approaches for planning education, and the problems they pose for achieving integration, are considered in this article. The discussion here is mainly concerned with the question of numbers, however; and it is confined to the formal education system.

Consumer price indices, computed to compare the price level in each state with that in rural India as a whole, are also employed to compare the average per capita total household expenditure in the different states at rural India prices. A major limitation of the price differential indices is the exclusion of item-groups like education and durables. Besides, there are inherent limitations of NSS household budget data which are not collected specifically for purposes of construction of consumer price indices. The findings may have been partly vitiated, therefore, by the unrecognised factor of quality variation. Finally, there are the intrinsic limitations of interregional comparisons of consumer prices owing to climatic or other environmental differences.||N. Bhattacharya,G. S. Chatterjee

The purpose is to achieve the best rate of national growth consistent with the requirement of inter-regional equity. This paper aims to examine the industrial structure of the regions and the changes in inter-regional diversification between 1956 and 1965 - the period covered by the Second and Third Plans. The analytical tools employed for this by it are estimation of location quotients and estimation of specialisation co-efficients, for each of the 15 States that have been identified as regions for the purpose. Finally, it examines the relationship between industrial diversification and levels of industrialisation of the regions.

An attempt is made in this article to explore what is involved in the conserving of the environment, and to suggest measures for assessing, managing, and controlling the wastes that lead to the environment's deterioration. It is argued that, if the pollution problem is to be forestalled or at least controlled, waste management will have to be incorporated into the project planning stage. To do this effectively, engineers of all specialisations will have to be trained from the start to view the problem in its entirety and not merely from within the narrow confines of their particular field.||Sudhir Deshpande

While industrial workers, through organised protest, managed to increase their real earnings on the eve of planning, the salaries of white-collar workers were generally eroded by the rise in prices. The white-collar workers, representing the social, cultural, and educational middle-class, were thus left with the legacy of having to maintain a certain way of life and prestige on an increasingly strained budget. It was in this atmosphere that white-collar employees first turned to trade unionism which they had earlier shunned as not quite in keeping with their status. This paper is based on a survey of white-collar unions in Greater Bombay. Its purpose is to trace the genesis, growth, finances, nature and functions of white-collar unions, and their affiliation patterns to the all-India level. [The survey was carried out as part of the Labour Research Laboratory in the Tata Institute of Social Sciences. The junior students of the Personnel Management and Labour Welfare specialisation took this up as a group research project and collected data from 21 white-collar unions in Bombay during November 1970 to January 1971. The author is grateful to these students for provision of the data for this article.]||S. D. Punekar

It is further argued that the alternative framework suggested by Bhagwati and Desai is inconsistent with the basic objectives of our Plans and cannot be expected to be more efficient. Bhagwati and Desai concentrate on the working of policy instruments - mainly, industrial licensing and import trade controls. But the shortcomings in our economic performance cannot be attributed to the deficiencies of these policy instruments. While it is true that the use of these instruments has quite often not been guided by any economic rationale or overall sense of direction, this must be traced primarily to lack of understanding on the part of the planners of the implications of the basic strategy of import substitution underlying all our Plans.||V.

Bhagwati and Desai's recommendations, the author argues, come straight out of the stable of resurgent neoclassical theory. They are eloquent on the inefficiency of arbitrary decision-making by bureaucrats and in its place they want to introduce the discipline of the market. The evils of competitive waste are well known but they are recapitulated here to get a perspective on the changes in planning strategy recommended by Bhagwati and Desai. The basic fact is that the desired volume of saving for society as a whole can never be achieved by the price mechanism unaided by central guidance. Many of the delays which Bhagwati and Desai attribute to the bureaucracy were really due to the shortage of savings and productive equipment: delay was, and remains, a method (though rather an arbitrary one) of rationing scarce resources. At the micro-economic level, the wastes of competition arise because of two different sets of factors. One set concerns the lack of co-ordination of production and investment decisions under atomistic competition. The other concerns the fact that competition is never perfect, particularly in the long run, and in the presence of any serious disequilibrium between supply and demand. The first set of factors has been adequately analysed as the anarchy of capitalistic production by Marx, the effect of dynamic external economies by Rosenstein-Rodan, Nurkse and Scitovsky and the consequence of 'secondary uncertainty' by Koopmans. This paper concentrates on the second set of factors. Concluding, the author suggests that there is another approach to development planning, different from that of Bhagwati and Desai - that of beginning the whole inquiry not with finding ways of encouraging private good but with devising ways of meeting public needs. Attention will then be shifted from individual marginal productivity to the productivity of social groups, from individual earnings to the earnings of whole societies, from the control of individual enterprises to the control of total environment. Egalitarianism may then be recognised not simply as one among several goals to be promoted when the society can afford that luxury but as a natural corollary of jointness of all effort and all consumption. Even in such an economy the price mechanism will play a role and will have to be used to get rather better terms from the external world than India has managed to do as an inefficient neocolonial economy; but social direction will play a much larger part in this than Bhagwati and Desai will allow.||Amiya Bagchi

But it has not been explained why the electoral choice in certain States should continue to fail to bring about a more rational alignment of political forces necessary for the stabilisation of political regimes. The kind of coalition that the erstwhile undivided Congress party represented and the effective balance of political power that it kept on defending have no relevance today. They have been under severe attack and must give way to a new kind of coalition (though not necessarily a "coalition government") representing an altogether different distribution of power, robust enough to carry on the burden of governance. How long will it take for the new coalition to emerge? What will be the characteristics of this coalition? Is it necessary that a similar coalition, in terms of ideological orientation, social composition and programmatic content, should emerge in all the four States studied in this paper-Bihar, UP, Punjab and West Bengal? If not, what pattern of differences is likely to emerge? These are some of the questions that come to mind when dwelling upon the post-1967 political developments in these States. While answers to these questions must be sought, it is not always easy to find them. However, some broad contours of the relevant forces impinging on the political process in these States can at least be indicated. As in the other papers in this series, we shall do this in terms of indicators of mass political behaviour rather than changes in factional alignments or coalitional prospects.||Ramashray Roy

28/8/1971- ||review of management, august 1971||4382439||Criteria for Evaluation for Capital Projects||Out of many competing capital projects, a choice of a few projects has to be made by applying certain decision criteria. The problem becomes more complex when interest rates are regulated by government. The market mechanism cannot provide appropriate guidelines in such an economy. The selected project must yield a minimum rate of return which would very likely be above the market interest rate and this minimum has to satisfy some social criteria. In addition to the rate of return on capital, a project should also be screened from the point of view of the additional domestic cost incurred for the foreign exchange saved or earned. This is particularly necessary when a project involves considerable capital expenditure in terms of foreign exchange and aims at either saving foreign exchange through import substitution or earning foreign exchange through export promotion. It is essential, from the point of view of efficient allocation of resources, that a project whose cost in terms of domestic resources at the prevailing exchange rate is higher than that of similar projects elsewhere in the world should not be selected. The satisfaction of this criterion would ensure international specialisation in industries that would be consistent with the comparative advantage of countries. Also this would guarantee to consumers at home a price which would be competitive with the international price and thereby would contribute to maximisation of their welfare. In Section I of this paper is outlined a method of evaluating the rate of return on capital projects It is shown how this decision criterion would be applied either to a project in isolation or to a set of a few projects to be selected out of many. Section II describes how the criteria of saving in foreign exchange can be applied to individual projects. The criteria are derived and the method of computation is outlined.

When investments are undertaken in a developing economy, they result through the multiplier in increased money incomes. A priori two phases may be distinguished in the consequent changing pattern of expenditure. Where average incomes are to start with very low, a very large proportion of the increments are spent on food or other agricultural consumption products; in the second phase, after the backlogs of hunger and malnutrition have been cleared, there operates an inverse relationship between incomes and the proportion spent on food. To test this hypothesis, this paper estimates the expenditure elasticities of demand in the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors for the agricultural and non-agricultural products. It is found that at the outset the expenditure elasticities of demand, of the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, for the agricultural and non-agricultural products, have remained more or less stable. Against this backdrop of stability, however, the expenditure elasticities of demand of the agricultural and the non-agricultural sectors, for the non-agricultural products, have shown a tendency to rise. Moreover, the expenditure elasticities for the non-agricultural products are consistently higher than those for the agricultural products for both sectors. [This paper is based partly on the author's doctoral dissertation "Agriculture-Industry Relationships in the Indian economy, 1948-49 - 1958-59", submitted to the University of Delhi in 1963.

However, under the existing, generally poor, economic conditions in the urban areas, there have to be necessary qualifications to this general principle. This article examines whether, in the existing socio-economic conditions of the Asansol-Durgapur urban region, it is possible to sustain such a water-on-payment system. It seems evident that, given the present inequality in incomes and housing facilities, there is no immediate escape from having to depend for funds on government grants and loans. In fact, till such time as the minimum as well as the general level of economic well-being of the urban consumers is improved, the water supply systems will have to be subsidised.||P. K. Saha

This paper attempts to make a beginning by focusing on the relationship between occupational mobility and political attitudes. This involves, first, identifying the social sectors that are prone to be occupationally mobile and, second, examining whether or not there are significant differences in political attitudes and behaviour between the occupationally mobile and the non-mobile. If occupational mobility is an important source of change in individual attitudes and behaviour, then it is legitimate to expect that the occupationally mobile will show greater interest in politics, will have greater comprehension of political matters and will manifest greater involvement in various political activities. It is not the magnitude of difference in the configuration of political attributes between the mobile and the non-mobile which is so important as the comparatively greater manifestation of these attributes among the mobile. The consistency of the author's findings highlights the fact that occupational mobility has a differential impact on the way citizens respond to their political environment. Apart from things like education and participation in elections, occupational mobility appears to emerge as an "investment" in the growth of a stable and aware citizenship.||N. K. Nijhawan
20/2/1971- ||special articles||4381645||Cultural Factors in Political Decision-Making: A Small Town Election in India||The study of small towns is methodologically strategic, as the small towns are connecting links between the villages at the one end and the religious, urban and industrial centres at the other end. Politically, small towns are connecting links between villages at the one end and region, State and nation at the other end. In their study of 'complex societies', however, anthropologists, have left this link uninvestigated, and have simply shifted their attention from the isolated village studies to urban centre studies. With the growing recognition, in the fields of political development and political modernisation, that India has continued to utilise some of its 'traditional' methods of decision-making even after the adoption of democracy, it has become relevant to examine how democracy, as one kind of political ideology, is going through the process of change within the framework of the values of a small town. An analysis is attempted here of a municipal election to discover how cultural factors have impinged on political decision-making. The analysis is carried through an examination of (1) the pre-election methods of candidate-selection, (2) the methods of political campaigning, and (3) the manipulation of political symbols.||Binod Chand Agrawal

Caste rivalries have affected the University almost since its inception and caste based educated societies have been one of the major factors in the rapid expansion and decentralisation of the University. The earlier Congress ministries were also particularly eager to expand higher education to serve a wider clientele. The effects of the inflation of university education have been both complex and controversial.||Glynn L. Wood

The success of the Green Revolution and the achievement of the Fourth Plan's foodgrains targets will, therefore, depend to a large extent on whether or not a major transformation takes place in rice production. A primary condition for such transformation is that the area under HYV paddy be pushed up substantially. For, the fact is that the area under HYV rice has failed to pick up to the same extent as the area under HYV wheat. In 1969-70, for example, while 37 per cent of the total area under wheat was covered by high-yielding varieties, only 12 per cent of the total rice area was so covered. A number of researches have already attempted to identify the factors responsible for this slow pace. While none of them questions the yield potentials claimed for HYV paddy, the studies generally cast doubt on the suitability of the new rice, on biological, institutional, and economic grounds. In this paper, the relative profitability of HYV paddy and wheat is examined with the object of determining whether some cost factors give HYV wheat an advantage over rice. The analysis suggests that, it is the lower net profits per acre for HYV paddy relative to HYV wheat that mainly account for the slower spread of area under HYV paddy. It is indicated here that profits from HYV paddy cultivation can be raised by further improvement in technology, reduction in unit costs of inputs, and higher crop prices.

01/5/1971- ||special articles||4381946||Pursuit of Industrial Self-Sufficiency: A Critique of the First Three Plans||Self-sufficiency was one of the major objectives of the first three Plans. Yet the economic rationale of this objective was never spelt out. Further, the policies adopted for the attainment of self-sufficiency were faulty and their implementation was unsatisfactory. As a result, the extent of self-sufficiency achieved during the first three Plans was insignificant. This paper examines the changes in the structure of manufacturing output during the period 1951-64 with a view to ascertaining the degree of self-sufficiency achieved in the first three Plans. To measure the changes in the structure of output, the various items of manufacturing output are divided into three broad groups according to the stage of production: finished goods, intermediate goods and primary or basic goods. There would be a certain relationship between goods at different stages of production and, depending upon the composition of finished goods, the production of intermediate and basic goods of a certain quantity and composition would be necessary. Thus movement towards self-sufficiency would narrow the distance between the first two groups of products and the third one, viz, final goods. To the extent this does not happen, production of final goods has to be sustained by import of goods belonging to the earlier stages of production. Data presented in this paper show that the relative importance of products in groups 1 and 2 supporting production of group 3 products remained more or less unchanged during the period studied. The share of final goods continued to be over 70 per cent during the period, indicating that the reliance of manufacturing output on imports remained unaltered. This conclusion remains unchanged even when traditional industries like cotton and jute textiles and food and tobacco are excluded so as to give greater importance to the engineering and chemical industries. These are the industries on the development of which special emphasis had been laid in the Plans for building up an integrated and more self-reliant structure of production. It would seem, therefore, that the goal of building up a more self-reliant economy did not come any nearer during the first three Plans. Confirmation of this conclusion is to be seen in the size and importance of maintenance imports of the industrial sector of the economy.||V. V. Desai

18/9/1971- ||special articles||4382529||Democratic Interlude for Nation Building: Fifth Lok Sabha Elections||How far the fifth Lok Sabha elections will prove to have laid the basis for enduring political development in the country, it is yet difficult to say. For the present, it is best to describe them as having provided a democratic interlude for nation building. The fifth Lok Sabha elections were significant, above all, for the trends in party-building that they brought to light. It has been suggested that the massive victory of the Congress presages a return to a one-party dominance situation. What is more likely, however, is that the forces of infrastructural politics may dominate in the state elections and the Congress may not in all cases sweep the poll as it did in the Lok Sabha elections. This tendency was evident in the state elections which were held simultaneously with the Lok Sabha elections. The poll verdict in the state elections did not indicate a trend towards return to the one-party dominance system. It is very likely that the state elections next year will confirm that India continues to move in the direction of a competitive democratic polity with the prospects of alternation of power between different parties. It is also possible that India may come to have a more viable party system as a result of the fifth Lok Sabha elections through a process of merger and fusion of political parties. Thus we may be left with three or four major national parties and this may result in relatively stable and like-minded coalitions in some states, a two-party situation in others and majority rule in still others. As for the Congress, it retains something of its earlier umbrella character, but the ruling elite in the party appears to be more prepared to opt in favour of the have-nots in the party's support structure. Nor is the Prime Minister banking only on the support of the rural masses; she has tried, with considerable success, to win the support of the urban voters, particularly the urban youth and the urban intellectual. If this trend persists, it should yield a more inclusive support structure for the Congress, covering both rural and urban areas. This rural-urban continuum in the support structure is also likely to force the pace of dovetailing of urban and rural development programmes to an extent never done before.||Iqbal Narain

While police commissions were appointed in most states in the sixties and they did fairly exhaustive studies of the situation in the states, there was no integrated all-India survey of the functioning of the police. The point is that, though the existing police system functions reasonably well within the terms of its operations, its achievements are less than adequate for the requirements of a vital democracy. It is not enough for the police to enforce law and order after an outbreak of violence. They must have a living contact with the people whose trust they must earn. What historical, organisational, and conceptual factors have prevented the police from shaping up for this task? This article outlines the general background of conditions in which, and goals towards which, the police in India have been functioning to date.||David H. Bayley

27/11/1971- ||review of management, november 1971||4382803||Foreign Collaboration in Indian Industry||What has been the impact of imported technology and investment on Indian industrial productivity, exports and growth? As the Reserve Bank of India study on the subject puts it, "the major problem in this field is, for instance, whether, on balance, foreign collaboration arrangements have resulted in, or can be relied on to result in, a net gain to the country? Have those firms and industries which have relied more on technology fared better relative to the others in terms of productivity and growth?" Central to the same theme are questions such as what exactly is the nature of knowledge imported under the technical collaboration agreements? Is the knowledge imported suited to Indian conditions and prevailing factor proportions? Has the implementation of foreign techniques resulted in a higher capital-labour ratio? Is the imported knowledge restructured to suit Indian factor and product market conditions? What has been the cost of such restructuring? How best to assess the quality of knowledge imported? Is the market for knowledge a perfect one? If not, what are the costs and benefits of operating in an imperfect market for knowledge? Questions such as these are easily raised, but answers are hard to find, mainly because of the lack of reliable and comprehensive factual and statistical data on the subject. A benefit-cost analysis of foreign technology requires much more comprehensive information than is available from published sources. A sector-by-sector analysis of the problems or even micro case studies of selected individual firms with foreign collaboration in each of the industrial sectors would be a more fruitful avenue of approach than overall macro studies.

Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return were evolved as tools to give proper weightage to these factors in making capital budgeting decisions. However, in evaluating projects, these two tools of analysis do not always lead to the same conclusion. The purpose of this note is to examine the circumstances in which divergent conclusions are reached and also to indicate which technique is to be preferred.||C. Rangarajan,Paul Mampilly

01/5/1971- ||special articles||4381948||Speculation, Profitability and Price Stability in Commodity Futures Markets||Speculation and futures trading have been blamed for accentuating short-term price fluctuations, for aggravating the rising trend of prices in many commodities, and for contributing to market instability. Government and the Forward Markets Commission have, therefore, favoured serious restrictions on some futures markets and have banned the functioning of others. Yet it can be empirically shown that since speculators make profits by buying when prices are low and selling when prices are high, they reduce price variations through advance anticipatory actions as well as earn profits. This study of various futures commodity markets found that profits were made by both big and small traders on their long positions, invariably over each futures contract, in most commodities. Thus, the tendency for the futures price to rise over the period of the contract and for profits to accrue to those who maintain the long position is empirically demonstrated. The study, therefore, questions the restrictive role Government has been playing in these markets.||L. S. Venkataramanan
29/5/1971- ||special articles||4382066||Understanding Occupational Change in India||Occupational change has been understood largely as change in the activities of the members of a society to earn their livelihood. The change is observed in terms of changes in the distribution of these activities in the socio-economic structure of society. From this it is only a step further to describe change by classifying activities in terms of role expectations and positions and evaluation of these role positions. Insofar as the social implications of these occupational changes are concerned, generally recourse is taken to study of occupational groups, their social characteristics, psychology, etc. In these types of study, social mobility is a favourite subject. All this is useful. But there is a feeling of inadequacy about these studies, insofar as they are taken as indicators of social change. This feeling of inadequacy can be pinpointed to activities being made the central point of observation and analysis and their being related to some of the economic, social and psychological attributes of different occupational groups. But the question that arises is: can a man not continue the same activity and yet change his person, i e, his social relationships? Also can a man not change his activity and not change his social relationships? The point of departure of this paper is the affirmation that a man can change his occupation and yet not change his person and vice versa. This affirmation requires us to shift the centre of attention from activity to person, i e, to social relationships. It is suggested that irrespective of the number and variety of occupational activities and the number of persons engaged in them, there could be occupational change if there is change in social relationships. It is further submitted that in India occupational change in this sense is taking place more widely than statistics of change in the number and variety of activities suggested.||I. P. Desai

They represent a particular mode of political participation chosen by those of the citizenry who, still retaining notions of personal effectiveness, feel that the system can and must be hurried, or pushed, into action. Whatever understanding ongoing socio-political research furnishes seems to point away from conceiving protest and dissent as political pathology, as irrational political behaviour; instead, it seems to be increasingly apparent that the conscience of protesters often represents a repository of articulated and accepted-but in practice denied-community values. Participants in protests-as more than one profile seems to indicate-are likely to be among those who, otherwise personally effective, are moved by fates other than their own in particularly crucial areas of their lives. In this article, we are concerned with this segment of the citizenry-those who have participated in or sympathise with mass political protests. In particular, we shall explore those economic, social and attitudinal characteristics which tend to be associated with them, in order that we may better understand what motivates them. This in turn may then lend greater insight into the nature of these protests. Many of the sources we draw upon have been derived from studies outside our country. The inferences we draw from these cross-cultural studies, therefore, must be regarded more as suggestive than conclusive when we evoke our own conditions.||Satish K. Arora

The origins of the JVP or People's Liberation Front go back to 1965, when a group of students realising that there was no 'pure' marxist revolutionary party or party of the masses in Ceylon, decided to mobilise the people, particularly in the rural areas. They gathered willing and ample support among educated unemployed rural youth. This made the nature of the insurrection unique in that ninety per cent of the membership of the JVP consisted of those below the age of twenty-five. Apart from the lag between education and economic development, the pattern of ballot-box politics encouraged the sprouting of radicalism among the young. In the last general election in May 1970, Ceylonese youth formed the major part of the uncommitted electorate. They realised their crucial role in bringing the present United Front Government to power and expected it to translate its electoral pledges into realities at the earliest possible time. These hopes being belied, the JVP planned an insurrection to overthrow the Government. The insurrection has now been subdued, but not crushed. Mere police and military operations are unlikely to resolve the struggle. In this context the political implications for the United Front Government acquire significance as it now faces a number of crucial questions. By forcing such questions to the forefront the JVP insurrection has issued a grim warning to the political leadership of Ceylon (and perhaps of India) and has harshly challenged its power structure.||Urmila Phadnis

The educational system, like most other systems, is essentially dependent on economic and political developments, but nevertheless, has a certain autonomy, or at least persistence, of structural and behavioural characteristics which, in their turn, tend to have important bearings on educational as well as other issues. Creativity and conceptualisation of the problems of our society are more likely to emerge from an appropriate - rather than from a borrowed, inappropriate and, therefore, sterile - educational framework which is closely linked with socially relevant work. This is, again, a programmatic position which may result only from a changed balance of social power. For, as it is, the present arrangements give the currently emergent elite a position of monopolistic advantage vis-a-vis the rest of society. In any case, conventional pedagogical assumptions and stereotypes prevalent even among some of our most creative and knowledgeable academics require to be controverted.||S. Shukla

The correlation matrix of the socio-economic variables is first examined in order to weed out the less significant ones and to find a smaller set of variables which move together and which approximately stand for economic and social development. Secondly, a principal component analysis is carried out on the basis of both this smaller set as also the original set of variables, and the districts are classified into four development categories according to the values of the principal component. Thirdly, discriminant analysis method is applied in order to subject this classification to a more rigorous test. The results from these two analyses are then compared with each other. Lastly, on the basis of this comparison the author summarises his own results with new rank values for the districts. [This exercise is a by-product of the author's research work, in collaboration with W H Morris-Jones, on Indian electoral data.

Policy must be enunciated with increasing precision so that it may be understood at every level. There is a pressing need for an effective, essentially non-partisan (although not aimless) monitoring of evidence and values. In other words we need to evolve more effective means for measuring and judging movement toward the socio-economic goals we set for ourselves. We must also come to terms with the restraints, both internal and external, upon the policy-planners as well as the social scientists involved in that process. In evaluating their recommendations and data it is necessary to determine the extent to which they personally subscribe to covert values as a result of their own background and orientation. Knowledge must be related to value goals in order to be relevant. This is important because policy-planning requires evaluative judgment rather than merely factual statements. Overall planning based on the use of indicators in the policy-making process is only partially dependent on the quality of these goals and indicators, the value-orientation of the planners, or the effectiveness of the communication process. It is also dependent on the degree to which the policy-maker responds to pressures from within himself, from within his constituency and from personnel in other political sectors who may be affected by the policy under consideration. The policy-maker, especially in a democracy, is of necessity pre-occupied with ensuring his political future. What, from an intellectual standpoint may be considered irrational constraints upon policy-making, are nonetheless, necessary as well as rational restraints from the viewpoint of the politician and the administrator. Policies are good only when they provide for all these factors. Where implementation of and control over policy become largely external and independent phenomena we have evidence of a policy failure.||Satish K. Arora
28/8/1971- ||review of management, august 1971||4382443||Management of Industry: Trends and Prospects||For Indian management the last 25 years have been a period of exciting changes, steadily broadening opportunities and a vast increase in responsibilities in the changing social and economic context. In the coming years, management has to face up to the twofold needs of professionalisation of its membership and the qualitative changes that go with this, and a vast increase in the supply of personnel keeping with the expected growth of small industry. The essence of professionalisation is the separation of management from ownership. Professionalisation of management, which is already evident in private industry, should in the nature of things influence the management patterns in the public sector. Professional management will thus tend to be drawn from a single national pool and the distinction between the two sectors would itself become less sharp. In the scheme of social objectives we have set for ourselves, owner-management is by no means on its last legs. In fact, with the accent on encouraging small industry, we should expect a large flowering of owner-managed enterprises in the coming years. The change is only that professional management, by virtue of its control over the larger and key industries, will acquire a primacy in Indian industry. The future owner-manager, who will be drawn from the old business sections as well as a broad group of technicians, managers and others, will still enjoy opportunities for showing his worth in fields specially demarcated for him. In this overall context, there are two areas in which management education will need to develop. Firstly, there is need for training a large number of people who are already engaged in industry. Secondly, it is necessary to build up local material for training purposes. Managements of existing enterprises should be more willing to provide such material to be developed into case material.||H.

1/7/1971- ||social control of business||4382352||Social Control of Private Business||Much of the confusion in the field of industrial policy since 1967 has resulted from the fact that, while Government has announced certain apparently radical approaches, the rationale behind them and the guidelines for their actual implementation have not been properly enunciated. This has adversely affected both governmental and entrepreneurial decision-making. An examination of official intentions and policies in relation to the private sector since Independence reveals that there has been no fundamental change of approach. The Directive Principles in the Constitution, the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1948, the Industrial (Development and Regulation) Act of 1951, and even the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956 that provided simply more flexibility to the 1948 Resolution, have remained the cornerstones of policy. The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act may be new, but it represents no departure or radical advance over these earlier features. What then has been responsible for the recent confusion? The fact is that the manner in which the controlling instruments have operated has been very much wanting in helping progress towards the social objectives of policy. It has been clear that what our industrial administration needs is more and better teeth. This does not imply paralysing and detailed control but selective and strategic control economically organised and operated. One precondition for such co-ordinated use of the instruments of policy is that all the essential information be pooled together in one centre and be available to every arm of the administration. The main instruments to be used for exercising social control over private business are: the Industries (Development and Regulation) Act, the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, and the financial institutions. Other controls, such as import and price controls, need to be used with discretion as they can otherwise spawn greater ills than those they are out to curb. This article argues that if the Industrial Policy based on the Dutt Committee Report has brought much uncertainty in its train, it is because the Government has overlooked the rationale underlying the Committee's recommendations in implementing them. There are now specific tasks, of spelling out and tightening of procedures, that the Government has to undertake to inject clarity into the industrial scene. These are outlined here. At the same time, business houses should recognise that there can be no major reversal of direction in policy and should map out a course of action for themselves consistent with the perspectives set by Government.||Eliot

12/6/1971- ||special articles||4382132||Measuring Rural Unemployment to Provide Guidelines to Policy-Makers||The problem of rural unemployment has defied measurement. An investigator usually gets such a range of replies that, in the face of the complexity and apparent nebulousness of the situation, classification becomes difficult. The purpose of this paper is, first, to review the approach to this question adopted by the Committee of Experts on Unemployment Estimates, and secondly, to sort out the several issues related to rural unemployment and suggest a theoretical framework for reducing the problem to manageable policy proportions. Since estimates of unemployment are not needed for their own sake but only to provide the necessary guidelines to policy-makers, the paper proceeds on the arbitrarily chosen objective that we seek full employment of all labour services that are offered in the market and at a wage rate equal to the peak season wage rate. The framework for identifying the extent of unemployment is constructed on this basis. However, additional knowledge - about shifts in the demand and supply functions of labour, and the levels of wage rates at different points in time, as well as the appropriate elasticities - is needed should we seek a satisfactory guideline for policy purposes. Estimates of these parameters, once they are obtained, will be highly useful for a considerable time period, since they are likely to be more stable than absolute numbers on unemployment. Using a framework such as the one outlined here, it is possible to project the levels of unemployment in the long run by incorporating (i) the changes in agricultural technology and its diffusion, and their effect on intra-year shifts in demand for labour; (ii) the changes in the potential labour force and the rural-urban migration patterns; and (iii) any other changes that might effect the demand and supply situations of labour.

1/1/1971- ||competitive politics and electoral change||4381554||Congress Factionalism at the State and District Level in Maharashtra: Some Theories||In analyses of Indian politics, conflicting groups are often identified in terms of caste or communal characteristics; or in terms of conflicting governmental and political roles wherein the nature of the conflict is not clearly or consistently defined (e g, the minister versus the party functionary); or in terms of social status categories (e g, the Patil versus the Deshmukh); or simply in terms of personal loyalties. In such analyses, often, the internal coherence of specific groups or the dissonance between groups is explicitly or implicitly traced to emotional or essentially irrational roots-roots which moreover, have no apparent common foundation. The author's investigation disclosed that such hypotheses did not consistently hold true in many cases and that even where such rivalries did exist, they were at most merely incidental factors which temporarily coincided with or were enhanced by a congruence of other events and factors. An attempt is made here to offer for the reader's consideration a more comprehensive hypothesis which suggests that the factional behaviour of Indian political actors is 'rational', partly in the sense that it is consciously reasoned out by certain politicians with reference to their personal predispositions and interests, and also in the sense that such behaviour follows a predictable pattern which somewhat corresponds with a configuration of environmental factors-socio-economic and political. Analysis of the author's data indicates that antagonistic, political behaviour has, to begin with strong economic roots. Moreover, the disease of factionalism-if it be such rather than a corrective mechanism generated by the system itself-is not due, ultimately, to the lack of selfless commitment to unify party ideals by Congress functionaries, as is often claimed; rather it is generated in part by the party ideology itself. Among the elements of the official ideology, it is specifically the economic philosophy of the 'mixed enterprise' and the way this has been interpreted which has produced a mixed or mixed-up political enterprise within the Congress Party organisation itself. It is this ambiguity toward public and private economic activity in the party ideology-juxtaposing in application mutually inimical economic practices and interests-which is, by extension, carried into the political behaviour of Congressmen. The result is factionalism. Factional behaviour is also generated and sustained by certain compelling needs of the political system within which the relevant political actors function.||Mary C.

The year before this, Jounti had already been marked out by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute, for encouragement and assistance, in IARI's seeds multiplication programme. By 1968, the village appeared to have emerged from the conservative environment of the surrounding villages as a rapidly modernising farm community and as an instance of singularly successful co-operation between a research institution and a farming community. Yet, in 1969, it seemed that the village seed enterprise was experiencing a major setback. This article traces the way various categories of Jounti farmers took to the new approaches and exploited their profitability, and looks into the events that led to the apparently successful venture's incipient failures which eventually became glaring. What emerges is that Jounti's setbacks were essentially those of a less than fully considered attempt to develop modern attitudes and economic institutions in a predominantly peasant agricultural sector.||Brian Lockwood,T.

1/1/1971- ||development theory revisited||4381557||A Welfare State for Poor Countries||Most people explicitly or implicitly accept the simplified theory of development which makes of GNP-per-head the main determinant of economic and social structure. For them, there exists but one broad pattern of industrialisation and development, and, since the developed countries have thought in terms of a welfare state only in the recent past, when their GNP was already a multiple of what it is today in the developing countries, the view is that the developing countries should wait rather longer before they provide social services. Yet, experience both in socialist and less developed countries shows that quite different paths of development are possible at comparable levels of GNP. It is possible to evolve a different design of living and to project development goals inspired by an original set of values and by an analysis of potentialities inherent to each country. Unfortunately, among the socialist countries the social welfare function is not subject to discussion except for details of implementation. To this author, this is a waste of an opportunity to assert the capability of socialism to choose, consciously and democratically, a design for living which is different from and superior to that of the affluent Western societies. In underdeveloped countries, for a variety of reasons examined in this article, and in spite of the lip-service paid to it in development plans, the problem of collective consumption and of social services has not been carefully equated-except in Cuba and Algeria. There are two reasons why developing countries should undertake such an exercise even in the initial stages of development when the GNP is yet not high enough to denote general affluence. First, because the physical productivity of social service workers is not at all dependent on their wages-unlike the cost of installing a plant which is usually much higher in such countries. Secondly, to the extent that technical progress does not significantly affect social services, it may indeed be rewarding to concentrate on social services in the initial stages of development. On the other hand, it would be futile to attempt quantification of the influence of social services on the productivity of labour: first, because social services are not just 'a cost' of economic development but are a major goal in themselves, and secondly, because attempts to correlate the influence of services such as education on productivity are theoretically still very unsatisfactory.||Ignacy Sachs

The critical requirements for the effectiveness of a management planning and control system must finally relate to the following questions: (a) Is the organisational structure such that it defines authority and responsibility in terms of jobs to be accomplished, the costs and revenues of which are controlled by the responsibility centre concerned? (b) Are the corporate goals and objectives translated into time-phased statement of unit targets based on the input-output relationship prevalent in the unit operations? (c) Is the reporting system such that it can quickly diagnose deviations from the desired results, particularly in those areas which represent key variables in operations? (d) Is the follow-up mechanism such that it ensures prompt remedial action by proper analysis, review and co-ordinated action? A management planning and control system must answer all these questions in the affirmative before it can be truly effective.||S. K. Bhattacharyya

27/3/1971- ||review of agriculture, march 1971||4381795||A Place for Co-operative Farming||If Indian agriculture is to be made a more rationally planned enterprise and the cultivators are to have the greatest possible understanding and control of their own destinies, then indeed collective farming should be considered the ideal pattern of organisation. Joint co-operative farms are a close second as far as social justice is concerned, but they frequently have the weakness of tending to perpetuate economic differences among members. In most cases, dividends on pooled land receive the largest share of profits, and increased productivity of the land which is due to investments and management by the co-operative are rarely taken into account. Also, profits earned from other ventures, such as processing, are usually included with profits from crops, so that those with land continue to receive a disproportionate share of the profits. Very few cultivators, other than the landless who are given land as condition that they cultivate collectively, can, therefore, be easily convinced to enter into collective farms. An equally important drawback is that very few cultivators have the understanding and knowledge required to manage collective farms at this point. Even joint co-operative farms may attract only a limited proportion of cultivators in the immediate future. Nevertheless, the capabilities of these production co-operatives for economic development with social justice should not be forgotten and they can be used as models to be aimed at, regardless of the increasing number of prosperous individual farmers or the various other kinds of farmer co-operatives and associations that are developed.||Richard Lerner

All these loyalties work simultaneously but they are situationally determined and operate at different levels. For instance, communal loyalty becomes operative whenever the main conflict is between Hindus and Muslims. In a situation where the conflict is between the members of the same religious community, internal cleavages come to the fore and crystallisation of political loyalties follows the line of sectarian or caste distinctions. Political ideology plays relatively little part in determining voting behaviour in the rural areas. It is however, difficult to say whether the value or importance of caste, religious and kinship ties is merely sentimental or emotional. Perhaps, a more detailed and empirical study will reveal that there are often very practical reasons behind a particular religious community, caste or kin group becoming active politically. [This paper is part of a project on the general elections of 1967 undertaken by the Department of Sociology, University of Delhi, with the help of a grant from the University Grants Commission.

In the African case, this was most evident over the Rhodesian issue. The failure of the African countries to implement their threat to break off relations with Britain did great harm to their cause, as it showed that most African states were either incapable of united action or did not want others to take their threats seriously. With regard to Britain's recent decision to supply Wasp helicopters to South Africa, once again, the reality of the situation debars Africans from taking any positive action. If the UN, the Commonwealth and other organisations prove ineffective and if world public opinion remains as nebulous as ever, then Africans do not appear to have any option but to accept the situation. The collective bargaining capacity of the Africans has been drastically reduced owing to (a) internecine differences and (b) the fact that they no longer seem indispensable in the global scheme of the Western powers. So if one or two African states attempt to force the issue either with Britain or South Africa they may find themselves cut off from the mainstream of continental developments. For the Asian members of the Commonwealth it would not be difficult to play it cool over the arms sale issue. India still attaches importance to its pro-nationalist and anti-racial stand; hence it would be willing to follow the African lead. But the difficulty is that the latter may not give a lead. However, in a queer sense, the resumption of arms sales to South Africa may prove useful to the Africans. So far they have depended on two strands of support to pursue their goals in southern Africa: first, the diplomatic and moral support given by the UN and other world bodies; and second, such financial and military aid as they could obtain from both Western and Communist powers to assist the liberation movements. Both have proved insufficient, if not disappointing. Yet, for the outside powers, southern Africa continues to be an unresolved area with potentialities for a great conflict. Even though the sub-Saharan region is given low priority in the global strategies of the Super Powers, they may not remain wholly indifferent if the arms factor precipitates a grave crisis. But in order to make them sufficiently interested, the Africans must encourage what they have so far been opposing, viz, an extension of the 'Cold War' to southern Africa. Can they do this? Are they willing to convert not only their style of diplomacy but also the structures and goals of their foreign policy? More importantly, can they entice Russia and America to enter into competition in this area?||Anirudha Gupta

The rulers of the Assam plains have adopted varying policies towards these peoples. A methodical record of the frontier tribes is available only after the advent of Ahom rule in Assam in the thirteenth century. The Ahoms who were constantly faced with threats from two flanks-Muslim rulers in the west and Shans and Burmans in the east-were eager to establish friendly relations with the tribes. They managed to do this by introducing, along with other measures, the posa system, which allowed the hill peoples a share of the produce of the fertile plains. For about six hundred years the Ahoms largely succeeded in maintaining cordial relations with the tribes through policies of great tact and diplomacy. When the British occupied Assam in 1826, they, unlike the Ahoms, proceeded to establish a degree of political and administrative dominion over the tribes. This was initially effected by punitive expeditions and later through the establishment of amenities like annual trade fairs. For a short period before World War One, the British became wary of Chinese encroachments into the tribal areas and set up several police posts. They did not, however, interfere in the internal life of the tribes, but they did take the initial steps in linking the frontier peoples with the rest of India.||P. N. Luthra

26/6/1971- ||review of agriculture, june 1971||4382196||Agricultural Revolution by Production Function||Indian agriculture by now is well-endowed with the estimates of Cobb-Douglas production function. But no one knows as yet whether increasing, decreasing or constant returns to scale prevail in this sector. Rather 'disturbing' is the intertemporal instability of production function for the same farms. In view of the widely scattered fragmentation of land holdings, land input as incorporated in a production function is not an unambiguous concept, specially in India. This raises serious doubts, in principle, with regard to the validity of the production estimates. The optimal farm size has to be determined in the light of a multiplicity of objectives such as production efficiency, minimum income for the peasant family, marketed surplus of foodgrains, and so on. In this broader perspective, the role of the production function is quite diminished. The optimal farm size - however determined - must be politically viable. Hence, it is imperative that the political and economic under-currents are fully recognised, and their future trends carefully analysed. A hypothesis is put forward here to the effect that the land size structure is tending in the long run towards a dualistic system where small peasant farms would peacefully co-exist with the affluent capitalist farms, if the present alignment of political forces continues. When the question of optimal farm size is subject to the intricate interaction of such dominant factors, it is a pity that some otherwise brilliant economists are naive enough to be lured by the glitter of a Cobb-Douglas production function with the standard errors, correlation co-efficient, and the sum of elasticities as the trimmings, which finally leads to a blind alley of deceptive conclusions in this context.||Ranjit Kumar Sau

1/7/1971- ||the regional matrix||4382339||Regional Development Policies||The author has, in two earlier articles in this journal, reviewed policies relating to regional development in the Five-Year Plans and the experience with them, especially in relation to State levels of economic development and rates of economic growth. The conclusions that emerged from this review were (i) that although reduction of regional disparities in development was a major objective of policies, the disparities continued to be large and had in all probability increased during the period of the first three Plans; and (ii) that a regional dichotomy in agricultural modernisation and growth was perhaps emerging with the western and southern States of the country well on the way to steady modernisation and growth while the eastern and north-central States remained stagnant or progressed very slowly. In this paper are discussed three areas of regional development in which formulation of new policies, modification of existing policies or more effective implementation of policies are most needed: (i) development of backward regions, (ii) industrial location, and (iii) urban growth. India has reached a stage in its planning when formulation of comprehensive policies on the spatial location of economic activities and the spatial pattern of development has become essential. The need for such policy formulation is underscored by the growing regional development pressures which, if not satisfied, could seek expression in counter-productive activities; by the possibilities of large costs to the economy from wrong decisions on location of large projects, taken under regional pressures; and by the lack of adequate policies in the neglected areas of industrial location and urban growth.||V.

Recently Amit Bhaduri has brought into a sharper focus the nature of the trade-off between the advantages of long life of a project and the corresponding disadvantages of long gestation period; and he has reiterated the above paradox. In this paper, we simply take into account, in addition, the effect of economies of scale also and, as is expected, we find that the paradox still holds.||Ranjit K. Sau

Another measure arises out of an evident linkage between banking efficiency and banking growth. This article combines these two measures and demonstrates the applicability of the results to the 15 nationalised banks. The banking data, however, relate to the 18 years prior to nationalisation.||A. M. Khusro,S. N. Raghavan,Khushi Ram,N. S. Siddharthan

A major explanatory factor appears to be an overestimation of the expectation of life during 1951-60 and the subsequent gains in mortality. A verification of the conjecture about decline in fertility having been greater than the assumed 5 per cent, will need intensive investigation when the 1971 age data become available. A likely important explanation might be a somewhat greater undercount than in the 1961 census. A comparison of the houselist estimates with the provisional population figures shows a surprising decline in the absolute population of three States of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Rajasthan and relatively low growth rates during 1970-71 in several other States. There is an urgent need to launch a sample matching of the houselists and final census count to determine whether the houselist estimates overstated the number of normal residents or the census enumeration was affected by a significant undercount. The provisional figures have shown the population of Punjab to be 10 per cent smaller than was projected. On the other hand, in Tamil Nadu the growth rate has sharply accelerated. The underlying reasons need to be investigated with due attention to inter-district variations in growth rates, the likely contribution of migration to these variations, as well as the possibility that the observed growth rates during 1941-51 and 1951-61 might reflect differentials in the completeness of successive censuses. Post enumeration checks tend to be subject to many of the same limitations as the initial census. It would be useful to utilise the field organisation of the National Sample Survey to undertake a truly independent check. A more or less permanent working group set up by a body like the Indian Council of Social Science Research would make possible a continuing dialogue between the census organisation and the social scientists and other users of census data. A research endeavour with high standards of scientific objectivity would help in the evaluation of census data which form the very foundation of the national statistical system.||Pravin Visaria
1/1/1971- ||development theory revisited||4381559||Public Sector Pricing Rules||This paper is concerned with giving a brief account of the rules that governments would want to follow (and, therefore, putative rules that they would not) in evaluating public sector projects under various plausible sets of constraints that governments may face in imposing taxes. The problem, in its most pristine form, is this: Suppose that, in a perfectly competitive economy, government is unable to impose lump sum transfers among individuals. It is well known that under some fairly mild conditions such an economy, in the absence of any government action, would, in equilibrium, be at a Pareto Optimum. But the distribution of income in equilibrium may be perfectly ghastly. Government now desires to increase social welfare by introducing distortionary taxes and undertaking public production. One would want to know then what the structure of optimum excise taxes is. One would also want to know what prices government would want to use in deciding on public production. It is the latter question that the author is, in the main, concerned with though he has something to say about excise taxes also.

They thus lost another opportunity to become effective levers of change, and in so failing reflected the basic weakness that plagues the body of scientists and technologists in this country. It is evident that, what prevents the scientists from becoming 'the minority in league with the future' is not lack of opportunity but the scientists' own incapacity to identify with particular social and political objectives and forces of change. Scientists and technologists can earn respect only via their commitment within society to human values and through their advocacy of radical social changes in conformity with specifically identified technological possibilities.||A.

25/12/1971- ||review of agriculture, december 1971||4382910||Green Revolution and Farm Income Distribution||The hope had been cherished that the rapid increases in agricultural output especially foodgrains, as a result of the Green Revolution, would help trigger off general economic growth by raising the level of available savings. There was also good reason for such a hope. But crucial to its realisation is the capacity of government policy to use the Green Revolution's potential benefits to greatest advantage. The problems that have attended the productive success of the Green Revolution have, however, yet to be surmounted. Among these, one of the most serious for economic and political stability is the unequal distribution of the gains from change and the perverse distribution of the burdens of change among those who gain least from it. This paper examines the problem of inequitable distribution by a theoretical analysis. It centres on the distribution of income, as revealed in the changes in production-functions and derived supply-functions for farms and for the sector as a whole. The impact is discussed as it relates to (1) changes in factor shares and (2) changes in the relative income positions of farms in the different income classes. A quasi-empirical demonstration is included to assist in the exposition of the logic.

15/5/1971- ||special articles||4382005||Technology and Development: A Marxian Approach||One of the problems of technological change that has worried economists since Ricardo's famous chapter on 'Machinery' is that of displacement of labour. Machines displace labour. While, therefore, accumulation resulting from technological progress tends to increase the demand for labour, it also operates in the opposite direction by creating instruments that substitute labour. Nevertheless, it has been generally held that the force operating in favour of employment dominates - ultimately, if not immediately - and that, in any case, accumulation and development surely persist. Is this true? Looking into the relevant literature, one feels that there is insufficient recognition in this context of the problem of obsolescence resulting from technological change. Machines that displace labour often also displace old (but not worn out) machines. Can we, then, confidently assume that technological change is always associated with an increase in the net investment in the economy?

In the popular mind, therefore, town planning and architecture have come to be strangely associated with expensive show-pieces on which have been wasted valuable and scarce national resources that might otherwise serve for dozens of low-cost houses and neighbourhoods. The gulf between the town planner and the architect on the ore hand, and the poor citizen on the other, is thus widening with the great urban challenge. Housing for the lower-income groups, not to speak of the very poor, has thus not earned attention or inventiveness from architects and town planners, whose passion to build expensively has got the better of their desire to build well and beautifully. The 1961 housing census revealed that a very high proportion of the urban population live in conditions that are appallingly bad. The bulk of the migrants from rural areas that constitute this worst-off group in urban areas are also the rural poor to whom the gains of agricultural growth have failed to reach. At the same time, the poorest-income group in the urban centres pay the highest proportion of their income by way of rent and taxes though they have the least of amenities. And yet, the literature on the subject of housing the urban poor is meagre. This article, therefore, welcomes G T Kingsley's and F S Kristof's Monograph, "A Housing Programme for Metropolitan Calcutta", as a refreshingly useful addition. Outlining the conditions in which the metropolitan poor live, the Monograph suggests two main approaches to alleviate them: (1) the maintenance and improvement of existing house-stock and (ii) new construction. This article considers the two approaches and argues that these two methods are not alternatives, but in our conditions should be concurrent and complementary courses of action enjoying almost equal emphasis.||Asok Mitra

Where Government finds it inconvenient for socio-political reasons, to impose a direct fiscal burden - such as an agricultural income tax or higher rates of land revenue - for mobilising the agricultural surpluses necessary for the growth of an industrial sector, a less painful tool available to it might be to make the terms of trade for agriculture adverse. This may indeed be a possible way out in India because if, as a first approximation, the relative wholesale prices of agricultural commodities and non-agricultural commodities are considered, there is unmistakable evidence that the terms of trade have moved in favour of agricultural commodities in recent years. Moreover, the benefits of this have gone largely to the big market-oriented farmers whose costs of inputs, too, have not risen proportionately owing to distribution controls or subsidies operated by Government. Nevertheless, high-income households are few in agriculture and the surpluses are usually diffused and scattered, posing a serious problem for the tax administration. The surpluses are, therefore, best tapped where and when they become patently overt through such devices as betterment levies and high irrigation rates.||S. L. Shetty

27/2/1971- ||review of management, february 1971||4381677||Micro Planning: The Neglected Interface||Social and economic systems have divergent subsystems which will work together effectively only when they are linked by an interface that ensures compatibility between them. Often, the individual subsystem by itself may be superb in its design, structure, and contents; and yet the total system may fail to work optimally because the interaction between, or the synchronisation of, the constituent parts has been neglected. Neglect of the interface can be costly in terms of the performance of the total system. In the national economic system, the two important subsystems that must work together in harmony for optimal performance are the subsystem of the government and the subsystem of the primary decision-making units. Failure of planning to yield results may be largely traced to the interface between these two subsystems. The direction of reform in this respect needs to be threefold: the basic urge among private firms or farms to seek profit needs to be harnessed in the service of national planning; micro-planning needs to generate a competitive environment in which private firms have to discipline themselves for the market; and thirdly, where such competition cannot be sustained, as where the public sector operates, operational goals have to be defined consistent with the national plan, and criteria evolved for performance evaluation.||Samuel Paul

Jyotirao Phule represented a very different set of interests and a very different outlook on India from all the upper caste elite thinkers of the so-called Indian Renaissance who have dominated the awareness of both Indian and foreign intellectuals. The elite expressed an ideology of what may be described as the "national revolution"; it was the nationalism of a class combining bourgeois and high caste traditions. Phule represented the ideology of the social revolution in its earliest form, with a peasant and anti-caste outlook. Phule's thought represented the fulfilment of the renaissance desire for social transformation along revolutionary lines. He, and not the later elite thinkers, from Ranade through Tilak, should be seen as the primary renaissance figure. Any culture rests upon a class society and the dominance of a particular class. In India, Hindu culture and the caste system rested upon Brahmanism; hence Phule linked his thought with a movement of opposition to the Brahman elite. "Non-Brahmanism", therefore, represented not simply communalism or a result of British divide-and-rule policies; it represented the first expression of social revolution. Phule, it is true, failed to provide economic analysis or political organisation appropriate for this struggle. But he had a clear vision of the need for and the basis of a liberation movement.||Gail Omvedt

In the context of modern agriculture in which the time of delivery of water is as important as its amount, there are significant defects in the way in which the water is delivered under this system. The farmer cannot control water delivery to ensure its taking place when he needs it, nor can he predict water timing in a particular year so that he can choose his crops and the planting, fertilising and water schedules in such a way as to make the most of the water when he gets it. One important way in which controllability of water might be achieved in some measure would be for farmers to sell water to one another or trade in it. Water trading and water sale are not now permissible. Yet these devices permit those closest to the growing of the crops to determine when water is of value to them and when it would be more advantageous to them to sell water or to advance or postpone its delivery as made possible by complementary needs on the part of others with whom water trading or sale is possible. The idea of small-scale water sales and swaps within a given area may seem radical to those accustomed to a system which does not now include this feature, but a number of contrasting irrigation systems in various parts of the world include such practices. One possible development to facilitate sale and trading of water might be some form of waterusers' associations, comprising all farmers on a given outlet or watercourse, which could contract with the government for timed delivery of water and then manage internally the problem of allocation among ultimate recipients.||W.

10/7/1971- ||special articles||4382280||Tax Incentives to Industries||In his 1971-72 Budget, the Union Finance Minister has proposed several modifications in the existing framework of tax incentives to industries. The Finance Minister has announced that development rebate will not be available for new investment in ships acquired or plant or machinery installed after May 1974. The extent of tax concession in respect of priority industries and benefit of tax holiday to new industrial undertakings is slashed with effect from the assessment year 1972-73. The increase in tax burden on industries implicit in these measures has given rise to fears of industrial investment being adversely affected. It may be useful in this context to analyse the various aspects of the tax incentives to industries. This article makes such an attempt.||

28/8/1971- ||special articles||4382444||Impact of the Family Planning Programme in Greater Bombay||The effectiveness of a family planning programme can be estimated by either an indirect or a direct approach. The indirect approach involves empirical measurement and analysis of fertility indicators in the population since the introduction of the programme. However, fertility is influenced by many other variables besides the programme and it is difficult therefore to isolate the impact of the programme alone; consequently, any conclusions solely on the basis of this approach are in the nature of judgments. The second, more direct, approach involves analysis of programme performance data. Data on the demographic characteristics of acceptors are used to assess the demographic impact of programme acceptors on fertility. This method has the drawback that it presumes what might have happened in the absence of a programme. A complementary use of both methods could, nevertheless, give a clearer view. These methods have therefore been employed to analyse the impact of the family planning programme in Greater Bombay. In terms of programme acceptance, the Bombay programme has been acclaimed as the most successful. Also, since the accelerated programme was introduced in 1965-66, the registered birth rate has declined steadily. As more information is available on this programme than on the programmes in other parts of the country, this paper presents a critical evaluation of it in the hope that it might offer useful insights into the introduction and impact of family planning programmes.

15/5/1971- ||special articles||4382003||Rural Works Programme: Where It Has Gone Astray||The rural works programme, which is about to be given a big push and for which Rs 50 crores have been provided under the Fourth Plan, is by no means a newly conceived idea. It was initiated as early as in 1961 "to utilise to the fullest extent possible the manpower resources of the country and to ensure a substantial expansion in employment opportunities". The programme was a recognised failure. Clearly, therefore, not any programme, least of all the one we have had so far, will serve the professed purpose henceforth. Lessons have to be learnt from past experience and failures. The indicators are that, whatever the programme contents, or however radical the planning body at the top, it is the district-level development machinery that proves crucial. At the same time, a detailed blue-print of the project, which is based on resource surveys, is free of red-tape, and has enough flexibility in implementation, is necessary. Moreover, self-help and a programme of maintenance and repair have to be built into the rural works project. This calls for a degree of the human resource mobilisation requiring popular propaganda which officialdom has till now failed to use.||Ranjit Gupta

21/8/1971- ||special articles||4382402||Planning for the Poor||The problem with Indian planning has been that it has not even begun to ask the fundamental questions. For whose benefit is the Plan formulated? Can the total resources of the country support a life style, now enjoyed by the upper middle class, for even a simple majority of the population? In other words, how far is industrialisation possible in the context of Indian resources and human needs? These questions are important since they affect the goals and strategy of planning and development. There is an equally important question as to what inequality means. Inequality is not a matter of incomes but of the supplies of goods. Inequality lies, fundamentally, in the fact that the supply of some of the commodities is less than their demand, defined in terms of needs and not in terms of capacity to purchase. The process of industrial production depends basically on two sub-processes: (i) the production of a particular commodity in large quantity; and (ii) the production of a large number of commodities in small quantity. The first sub-process reduces inequality while the second increases it. The question has to be asked as to which of the sub-processes Indian type of planning leads to. This leads to another philosophical question about the purposes of planning. Is the purpose of planning to create a new and better society or is it to make India 'modern'? For the purposes of creating a better society one would think that planning should continuously reduce scarcities. This may involve that the allocation of resources has to be such as to produce a few commodities. If the structure of industrial production does not move in this direction, then there is a conflict and the planning authority has to analyse this conflict so as to be able to make a meaningful decision.||Romesh Diwan

28/8/1971- ||review of management, august 1971||4382435||Delays in Adoption of Management Techniques in Governmental Administration||The modern developing state is schizophrenic about management tools insofar as it is subject to four contradictory pulls in regard to maximising net outputs. The law and order state ideal still governs a part of its activity, and so does the simple Keynesian balancing ideal. Neither of these calls for any effort to maximise anything, except stability. As against this, the neo-Keynesian economic growth ideal calls for balancing at higher and higher levels - maximisation of net output. Finally, external imitation of competitive subsystems leads governmental subsystems towards maximisation of their own net output and suboptimisation of sectional outputs. These four pulls act with different strengths in different parts of a vast governmental administrative apparatus. The final result is not easy to predict and differs from one government to another and one situation to another within the same government. There are areas of government, such as steel and fertiliser factories, where work study, network analysis, operations research, and linear programming are being used. There are areas of government where all that is used is simple O & M study of the speed of 'file movement'. Greater contact between the two areas, in training courses and conferences, and through interchange, would increase general awareness of possible management tools. This awareness is as important as deeper knowledge of individual tools, gained by instruction.||V. Subramaniam

An analysis of the problem from the short and the long term points of view reveals a number of implications for India which may not be obvious to the casual observer. The problems and opportunities created by the dollar crisis may not be as simple or marginal as many seem to think. While it is true that the US import surcharge may have only a marginal immediate effect on our exports to the US, the real danger to our exports lies in the restrictive attitudes that may develop in the US in the wake of the wage price freeze. An overall reduction of even duty free imports into the US may occur and in that event is likely to hurt our exports on a wide front. Prospects of foreign aid will turn worse irrespective of the solution that is finally hammered out to solve the dollar crisis. It does not seem likely that the EEC countries and Japan will fill the gap that will be left by the reduced role that the US will play as an aid donor hereafter. Given this situation and our growing burden of external debt servicing, there is no alternative for us but to go all out for stepping up our exports. On the brighter side, there is the prospect that our exports to Western Europe may receive a much needed fillip as a result of an effective dollar devaluation. The revaluation of the EEC currencies will reinforce the push given to our exports by the general system of preferences. A similar trend may not develop in our trade with Japan. Because of our strict exchange control system, our import picture is not likely to change very much.||Samuel Paul,Charan D. Wadhva

Intra-occupational comparisons between two societies suggest that particular occupations attract people who have similar values, and that the choice of occupation is determined more by those values than by the reputed characteristics of the culture of a society. A comparative study of business students in the US and in India indicates that cultural images of the two countries are simply inadequate to explain the choice of occupation by the students, and that the two groups do share a definite view of life and a certain preference of values.

20/11/1971- ||special articles||4382773||Impact of Green Revolution on Landless Labour: A Note||Studies have shown that thus far the demand for labour per hectare has not been significantly curtailed by the so-called Green Revolution. This is because increased use of farm machinery has also led to multicropping and more intensive agriculture. However, the nature of labour demand has changed. For instance, more talented labourers are sought after for year-round employment. Also, at peak periods, such as harvesting, labour demand has become more critical because of the need quickly to clear the land and prepare it for the next crop. This has resulted in high wages at harvest times, and in fact throughout the year. The farmers consequently are seeking harvesting combines and other machines to replace slow and increasingly expensive manual labour. It seems fairly clear that demand for labour will diminish as agriculture becomes more mechanised. Large landowning farmers are becoming prosperous with the help of government agencies, banks, and co-operative societies. They are investing in capital intensive equipment in order to enhance their direct control over agriculture and also their income. The small cultivators and the landless labourers, on the other hand, are losing out in several ways. For instance, the demand for their traditional services has diminished, availability of land on crop-sharing basis is reduced, inflation has kept their real wages almost constant, and alternate employment opportunities have lagged behind need. Consequently, the two classes are becoming polarised and increasingly antagonistic to each other. At this early stage, the problem may not be difficult to solve. But before it eteriorates further, the situation must be carefully analysed and effectively remedied.||Partap C. Aggarwal

This will help in understanding the nature of the emerging party system. Unless we know which type of political parties function as coalitional structures with a heterogeneous support base and which type of parties function as interest groups with a homogeneous support base of an economic class or ethnic group character, any systemic analysis of the party system will be an abstract theoretical exercise. Attempts have been made, through aggregative analysis of electoral statistics and census data, to identify the support bases of political parties, mostly at the State level. By matching social and economic aggregates of a region with electoral performance of the various political parties in that region, inferences have been drawn about the support bases of different political parties. While such analyses are important insofar as they suggest hypotheses about the general distribution of the regional strength of various parties and the probable gross correlation of party support with socioeconomic stratification, they do not provide us with an adequate profile of parties in respect of the socioeconomic characteristics of their individual supporters. For the first time we have data here on these relationships which relate to the country as a whole.||D. L. Sheth

27/11/1971- ||special articles||4382809||For Whom the Engineer Toils||The manpower model in its policy form applied to higher technical education implicitly sees the individual engineer as an industrial number compensated with certain privileges. No consideration is given to the personal development of the engineer, and no education is provided to enable him to improve his performance as a social actor. Attempts to allot a small percentage of the curricular time to courses in the humanities and social sciences are laudable, but these have to be seen as a mitigating influence rather than a remedial one. What is called for is the development of a philosophy of technical education rather than a utilitarian policy. A philosophy of technical education can be developed from the consideration that an engineer should act ethically in his work. There are two educational principles which follow from this consideration. First, an engineer requires the knowledge that will enable him to understand the physical and social consequences of his actions. Secondly, an engineer should receive an education that would make him more likely to act ethically. The political implications of higher technical education also cannot be overlooked. Engineers have a higher propensity for mobility to the highest ranks of industry. If they are at no time in the educational process exposed to enlightened thought, then what sort of an industrial elite is in the making? In the educational context, we are as responsible for the ideas and values that we fail to try to change as we are for those that we try to inculcate. Education changes people, and designing programmes of education that will change their ideas and values is a very delicate task, but not one that can be avoided. And, surely, we can all agree on a number of specific issues ranging from designing street lights so that they do not shine into bedroom windows to designing modes of transport that do not kill people and to cities that have parks in them. In any nation that is progressing industrially there are two essential questions to be answered, industry for what and a better life for whom? Engineers should be educated so as to be capable of considering these questions.||Richard F. Devon

The real controversy between Court and Parliament has thus been on the right to property. As a result of the twenty-fifth amendment, the right to property would stand abolished for all practical purposes. This kind of drastic legislative action has been made necessary by the excessive emphasis on the compensation clause in article 31 in the recent decisions of the Supreme Court. The twenty-fifth amendment, moreover, cannot be challenged unless the twenty-fourth amendment is held invalid. For the protection of property rights in future, therefore, reliance will have to be placed on parliamentary powers rather than on judicial process. In the first part of this article, which appeared last week, were discussed (i) the legal position before the Golaknath case, (ii) constitutional amendments before 1967, and (iii) the Golaknath case itself. In this, the second and concluding part, is discussed (iv) the interpretation of the right to property by the Supreme Court, and (v) the proposed constitutional amendment and the likely judicial response.||S.

The Reserve Bank of India's studies on finances of private limited companies, for example, are restricted to the relatively large and generally better off companies, even though the bulk of private limited companies are small and do not do well. Moreover, data on an adequate basis have not yet been compiled on the structural aspects of this segment of the private corporate sector. This study was, therefore, undertaken to probe the pattern of ownership and management and the financial structure of the private companies on a census basis and to analyse their financial performance. Maharashtra was selected for the study as it covers a large proportion of the private limited companies in the country. The study is being published in three parts. The first part, which appeared last week, summarised the main findings. This, the second part, deals with Ownership and Management. The final part, to be published next week, will examine the Financial Structure and Performance of these companies. [This project was undertaken at the UGC Centre for Advanced Study in Economics, University of Bombay. It was initiated by R K Hazari, whose guidance and invaluable suggestions were always available.

27/2/1971- ||review of management, february 1971||4381678||Considerations in Designing Management Control Systems||Management involves both planning and control, because, without the benchmark developed out of the planning process, no effective control can take place. The management control process may be usefully viewed, therefore, in terms of two substreams-formal planning systems and management reporting systems. However, designers of control systems in most cases have not been able to translate the accepted conceptual framework of management control systems into models responding to the particular needs of client-companies. This article, therefore, focusses on considerations that must go into designing a management control system. The contention is that, if the formal planning system has been effectively designed, the end product in the short run is a formal plan or budget which formalises the overall corporate objectives for that period in terms of sales, costs, margins, overheads, profits, etc, which can be further broken up in relation to various products, operations and geographic locations of the organisation's activities. Thus, once the formal plan has been designed, one can begin to develop the framework for an effective mangement reporting system.||S. K. Bhattacharyya

In the organisational planning to fulfil their new role, banks could with benefit practise management Development. This concerns the processes of recruitment, placement, training, promotion and appraisal, in order to ensure that the right number of staff with the right capacities are available at the right time and for the right places. In that effort, appraisal is a key factor. This paper, therefore, examines the inadequacies of the present appraisal practices and presents an alternative approach and system based on Management by Objectives.||Kalyan Banerji

India could, if it wished, have made it impossible for the British to implement their Immigration Act by simply and firmly refusing entry to British Asians. For a number of reasons, including pressing compassionate ones, the Government of India allowed the British Asians in. Although the British Asians were not entirely blameless, the British and Kenyan Governments acted in a high-handed manner due to internal political compulsions, many of them dubious. These internal currents as well as the international dealings of the Indian, Kenyan and British Governments on this issue are critically examined and some of the spurious manoeuvres exposed.||Pradip Nayak

18/9/1971- ||special articles||4382528||Sino-Indian Relations||In the wake of a significant electoral victory, the Government finds itself in a sufficiently strong position to move away from the old line on China. After an interval of several years it is showing signs of adopting a high-key posture in foreign policy, especially in matters of direct national concern. India can also gain impetus from the great fluidity in recent international dealings. The crisis in Pakistan provides India with an excellent opportunity to reappraise the nature and scope of Sino-Pak friendship. India, till now, has missed the point that the collusion between China and Pakistan may not be total, though outwardly China might assure Pakistan of its support and sympathy. There are, also, several stimulants on the Chinese side to normalise relations with India. In the seventies, China does not consider India a major competitor in the international field or a physical threat to its territorial integrity. It may, therefore, be persuaded to ease tensions with India in view of its concentration on the Soviet problem. Perhaps, the Sino-US detente may lead to an improvement in Sino-Indian relations too.||T. Karki Hussain

28/8/1971- ||review of management, august 1971||4382434||Management Component of Cost of Capital||Firms of equivalent risk class have a common cost of capital which is independent of the capital structure of the firms concerned. In this paper it is hypothesised that, were the class and political risks to be held constant, the variance in the capitalisation rates of earnings of individual firms in a given class of industry as reflected in the market price of shares could indicate, fairly accurately, a way to measure managerial competence. The model developed here should enable quantification of managerial efficiency from year to year in relative and absolute terms. It could be a tool in the hands of shareholders to demand explanations from Boards of Directors for fall in the price of shares and consequently in the value of the firm as they get some idea about the opportunity loss attributable to managerial inefficiency. In addition, the model helps evaluation of managerial performance over time and between companies. Security analysts could make use of the approach by ranking industries in the order of their group risk and individual firms in the order of their managerial performance. It needs to be added, however, that the model relies heavily on shareholders' judgment and, therefore, could be deceptive to the extent to which shareholders (to include prospective investors also) are irrational.||Paul Mampilly

27/2/1971- ||review of management, february 1971||4381684||The Problem of Labour Commitment||While there is increasing concern among the managerial elite about employees' lack of interest or involvement in their work, the terms they use to explain the phenomena are often oversimple and one-sided. There is, for instance, the classic myth about the 'economic man' suggesting that an employee's principal motivator is money or some other form of material wealth. Hence the unsuccessful attempts to raise workers' commitment through frequent doses of monetary incentives. In fact, the main lesson of several recent studies, intended to analyse the problem of employees' commitment to their jobs, has been that it is essential to raise meaningful questions regarding commitment within specific technological, regional, or cultural contexts. The studies have also exposed the inadequacy of overt behaviour patterns in analysing problems of labour commitment, emphasising the attitudinal and sentimental aspects of the relationship between an employee and his job or employer. Indeed, in this context the role of managers in creating-or failing to create-adequate commitment among workers needs to be especially focused on. Often too, contradictions of organisational structure-such as when individuals work under particular persons but have to report to others-lead to unpleasantness and consequent lack of commitment. Apart from psycho-social factors, the technological factor merits attention insofar as the less employees feel that they are meaningfully contributing to the end product or the less they feel that they have a say in the technology used the more alienated they get from their jobs. This is why the highly committed are generally also the highly skilled and endowed. What emerges is that the workers' lack of commitment is something of a myth which merits far closer scrutiny to help formulate a work/management environment which is far more conducive to greater productivity.||N.

27/11/1971- ||review of management, november 1971||4382804||Recruitment and Promotion Policies in Commercial Banks||The present procedures for recruitment and promotion in banks have evolved over the years in an ad hoc manner. Yet a proper solution to these problems is crucial for evolving a set of banking practices that are efficient and tuned to the attainment of national objectives. Recruitment is generally based on merit tested through competitive examinations for applicants drawn from all over the country. This method may be suitable for services such as the civil service and the judiciary, but for non-officer jobs in district branches of banks which require local knowledge and trust and a modicum of accounting ability and reportive clarity, it would be far better to recruit from among local persons who have passed the school-leaving certificate examination. Such persons could even qualify for the officer cadre through a special banking examination. The branches could then be entrusted with greater responsibility and operate like subsidiaries of the lead banks.||V. V. Bhatt

However, without consideration of the number of days worked, daily wages tell little about the economic situation of a group. Also, the relation of the agricultural labourer to the others in the agricultural sector is important. Here, growth rates of production rose much more than growth rates of real wages, suggesting that the labourers received only a small share of the gains.

These are: first, that grain should be readily available at short notice; secondly, that the total cost of procurement, handling, and transport should be the minimum; and thirdly that such storage capacity as is created should be optimally utilised. In this paper an attempt is made to construct a linear programming model to help in decisions about location and capacity. The time horizon in view is the Fourth Plan period. The focus is on finding out what will be the storage requirements by the end of 1973-74. [The authors are grateful to A M Khusro for comments, and to S Vohra for giving a practical insight into the problem and for encouraging the completion of this work.
