The attempt to develop a new radical economics represents an effort to provide an intellectual basis for a more effective attack on the manifest ills of American society than the discredited liberals could mount in the past decade. The radical wants to understand better why poverty, racism and sexism persist in the United States, why American troops and bombs continue to be sent to distant lands to wreak their havoc on innocent peoples, why the natural environment is destroyed in the name of progress, why increasing wealth does not appear to lead to greater human welfare but only to a heightened sense of alienation on the job, in the community and at home. The radical suspects that these problems are in fact deeply rooted in the basic institutions of American capitalist society. To understand and to combat these problems, the radical requires an analysis of the fundamental nature, structure and dynamics of that society. This article seeks to describe briefly the origins and the content of the new radical economics that has attracted increasing attention and a growing following in the United States.||Thomas E.

But this is a limited view, both of development which should signify more than just economic growth and of processes by which damage to the environment occurs even as GNP is being increased. This article argues that developing countries cannot afford to take such a restricted, accounting view of their long-term development. The planning in developing countries should encompass objectives that are not strictly calculable by cost-benefit analysis and methods that capitalise on public participation.

Over a period of 19 years, Budhlada voters have exercised their franchise eight times - each time, differently. The major contenders for political power have been the Congress, the Akali Dal, and the Communists. A breakdown reveals that, while the first two parties held the seat for nine years each, the Communists secured it for one year. In view of the keenness of electoral competition and the shifting voter loyalties in Budhlada, it is interesting to examine the circumstances that determined voter support in 1967 and 1969. It is found that while intra-party harmony and campaign strategy and organisation may have immediate impact, the socio-economic context is also highly relevant to the voting decision. As the proportion of agricultural labourers increases, for instance, the drift is Leftward; similarly, as the distribution of Government patronage in terms of amenities decreases, the drift is towards the opposition. The stability of electoral politics, it would seem, depends largely on the ecological make-up of the area, the socio-economic context playing a crucial role in the elections. Low concentration of scheduled castes, high literacy rate, less pressure on land, low proportion of agricultural labourers, greater participation in economic activity, and lower concentration of displaced persons - appear to be factors that give a polling area a stable support base. On the other hand, high social and economic diversity results in fluctuating voter loyalties, making the area shift its support from time to time.||R. Chandidas

Consumer price indices, computed to compare the price level in each state with that in rural India as a whole, are also employed to compare the average per capita total household expenditure in the different states at rural India prices. A major limitation of the price differential indices is the exclusion of item-groups like education and durables. Besides, there are inherent limitations of NSS household budget data which are not collected specifically for purposes of construction of consumer price indices. The findings may have been partly vitiated, therefore, by the unrecognised factor of quality variation. Finally, there are the intrinsic limitations of interregional comparisons of consumer prices owing to climatic or other environmental differences.||N. Bhattacharya,G. S. Chatterjee

Bhagwati and Desai's recommendations, the author argues, come straight out of the stable of resurgent neoclassical theory. They are eloquent on the inefficiency of arbitrary decision-making by bureaucrats and in its place they want to introduce the discipline of the market. The evils of competitive waste are well known but they are recapitulated here to get a perspective on the changes in planning strategy recommended by Bhagwati and Desai. The basic fact is that the desired volume of saving for society as a whole can never be achieved by the price mechanism unaided by central guidance. Many of the delays which Bhagwati and Desai attribute to the bureaucracy were really due to the shortage of savings and productive equipment: delay was, and remains, a method (though rather an arbitrary one) of rationing scarce resources. At the micro-economic level, the wastes of competition arise because of two different sets of factors. One set concerns the lack of co-ordination of production and investment decisions under atomistic competition. The other concerns the fact that competition is never perfect, particularly in the long run, and in the presence of any serious disequilibrium between supply and demand. The first set of factors has been adequately analysed as the anarchy of capitalistic production by Marx, the effect of dynamic external economies by Rosenstein-Rodan, Nurkse and Scitovsky and the consequence of 'secondary uncertainty' by Koopmans. This paper concentrates on the second set of factors. Concluding, the author suggests that there is another approach to development planning, different from that of Bhagwati and Desai - that of beginning the whole inquiry not with finding ways of encouraging private good but with devising ways of meeting public needs. Attention will then be shifted from individual marginal productivity to the productivity of social groups, from individual earnings to the earnings of whole societies, from the control of individual enterprises to the control of total environment. Egalitarianism may then be recognised not simply as one among several goals to be promoted when the society can afford that luxury but as a natural corollary of jointness of all effort and all consumption. Even in such an economy the price mechanism will play a role and will have to be used to get rather better terms from the external world than India has managed to do as an inefficient neocolonial economy; but social direction will play a much larger part in this than Bhagwati and Desai will allow.||Amiya Bagchi
1/1/1971- ||competitive politics and electoral change||4381554||Congress Factionalism at the State and District Level in Maharashtra: Some Theories||In analyses of Indian politics, conflicting groups are often identified in terms of caste or communal characteristics; or in terms of conflicting governmental and political roles wherein the nature of the conflict is not clearly or consistently defined (e g, the minister versus the party functionary); or in terms of social status categories (e g, the Patil versus the Deshmukh); or simply in terms of personal loyalties. In such analyses, often, the internal coherence of specific groups or the dissonance between groups is explicitly or implicitly traced to emotional or essentially irrational roots-roots which moreover, have no apparent common foundation. The author's investigation disclosed that such hypotheses did not consistently hold true in many cases and that even where such rivalries did exist, they were at most merely incidental factors which temporarily coincided with or were enhanced by a congruence of other events and factors. An attempt is made here to offer for the reader's consideration a more comprehensive hypothesis which suggests that the factional behaviour of Indian political actors is 'rational', partly in the sense that it is consciously reasoned out by certain politicians with reference to their personal predispositions and interests, and also in the sense that such behaviour follows a predictable pattern which somewhat corresponds with a configuration of environmental factors-socio-economic and political. Analysis of the author's data indicates that antagonistic, political behaviour has, to begin with strong economic roots. Moreover, the disease of factionalism-if it be such rather than a corrective mechanism generated by the system itself-is not due, ultimately, to the lack of selfless commitment to unify party ideals by Congress functionaries, as is often claimed; rather it is generated in part by the party ideology itself. Among the elements of the official ideology, it is specifically the economic philosophy of the 'mixed enterprise' and the way this has been interpreted which has produced a mixed or mixed-up political enterprise within the Congress Party organisation itself. It is this ambiguity toward public and private economic activity in the party ideology-juxtaposing in application mutually inimical economic practices and interests-which is, by extension, carried into the political behaviour of Congressmen. The result is factionalism. Factional behaviour is also generated and sustained by certain compelling needs of the political system within which the relevant political actors function.||Mary C.
