It seeks to show that the SLEPs are different from the Central public enterprises in terms of their environment, size, strategies, management processes and performance and, therefore, deserve special attention from students of public enterprises. It pointedly draws attention to the paucity of even factual information about the SLEPs and the many glaring contradictions even in official and semi-official accounts regarding such elementary data as the total number of such enterprises in various states. Its findings are that while huge financial and human resources have been invested in various SLEPs and important tasks of social and economic development have been assigned to them, their overall performance has been for below expectations. One of the important causes for such failure is political and bureaucratic intervention in operational matters.||B. L. Maheshwari
