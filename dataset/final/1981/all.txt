This paper attempts to look into: (a) the general marketing problems of small and marginal farmers, and (b) specifically the effects of poor accessibility to the marketing centre.||U. Aiyasami,H. G.

It considers the impact of these international oligopolies on the millions of peasants and labourers, the industrial proletariat and the capitalist class both in the developed and underdeveloped capitalist economies, and the finance and trading capitalists in the developed capitalist economies. Its findings are that these oligopolistic tendencies have transformed even labour intensive industries like the cotton textile industry into a capital intensive industry; this in turn has contributed to both overcapacity of production and very high levels of unemployment - trends which will gain further momentum with further industrial application of the microprocessor revolution.||Frederick Clairmonte,John Cavanagh

It seeks to show that the SLEPs are different from the Central public enterprises in terms of their environment, size, strategies, management processes and performance and, therefore, deserve special attention from students of public enterprises. It pointedly draws attention to the paucity of even factual information about the SLEPs and the many glaring contradictions even in official and semi-official accounts regarding such elementary data as the total number of such enterprises in various states. Its findings are that while huge financial and human resources have been invested in various SLEPs and important tasks of social and economic development have been assigned to them, their overall performance has been for below expectations. One of the important causes for such failure is political and bureaucratic intervention in operational matters.||B. L. Maheshwari

If third world countries follow the same path of industrialisation and modernisation as the developed countries, there is no other way but to establish linkages with transnational corporations. If the target to be achieved and the way to achieve it are determined on the basis of their own resources of technology and capital, third world countries may come out of the orbit of the operation of transnational corporations. This study relates to the power sector in India between 1947 and 1966-67. The study is divided into four sections. The first section deals very briefly with the world electric power equipment industry and the position occupied by the transnational corporations. The second points out the role played by transnational corporations in the construction of power plants in India. The linkages established between the transnational corporations and the private sector in India in manufacture of electric power equipment is the subject matter of the third section. The fourth section shows the linkages of the transtional corporations with the public sector in Indiain the manufacture of electric power equipment.||Subhendu Dasgupta

How did Nehru come to entrust so great a responsibility to a man whom he had never met before 1945 and whose qualifications were so slight? Did Nehru see in Mayer's suggestions for improving the livelihood and the life of the villages as a whole a hope for holding off a brutal challenge to the status quo on the part of the village have-nots? Did he, in those hopeful years, believe that land reform legislation would soon remove the most glaring inequalities and that it was essential to procure a respite from violent confrontation until these laws could be passed and implemented?||Alice Thorner

It is also a familiar argument that substantial improvement requires more delegation of responsibility to water users, for planning and day-to-day management. Less faimliar are serious attempts to explain why, in India, the traditional top-down approach persists even for small 'tank' projects, with engineers continuing to have the dominant role in design and construction, and with the building of local management capabilities continuing to be overlooked. Less familiar, too, are practical suggestions about how the government might go about implementing an approach based on fostering local collective responsibility. Certainly economists, who were the first to demonstrate just how badly many irrigation projects have been working, have contributed little to either subject (Bottrall 1918). Case studies can offer some guidance on how the government might go about fostering local collective responsibility. One such case is the recent attempt by the Philippine government to foster local collective responsibility not only in management but also in design and construction.||Robert Wade

The effect of mining might be inversely related to the so-called EMV. Hence the deposits need to be evaluated in terms of their placement in the environment. The present exercise is an attempt at a conceptual framework to point up the imperative and possible path of solution.||S. K. Sadhukhan,R. Sen

23/5/1981- ||special articles||4369862||Assam's Industrial Development: Urgency of New Direction||Looking at various aspects of the economy of Assam, this paper argues that Assam's present dismal state of affairs is the outcome of a basic structural weakness inherited from the British, but which has been systematically reinforced by the Indian government. While there is a case for Assam's industrialisation, mere setting up of a few industrial units engaged in the processing of non-replenishable natural resources is not only incapable of generating general economic development but is also harmful to the economy as it sucks the region dry of such resources. Moreover, there has also to be a systematic drive for ancillarisation. The paper analyses the role of the three major industries of the state, viz, tea, oil refining and plywood. Industrialisation is viewed as a cumulative process of increase in labour productivity, income, saving, investment, employment, and output, leading to diversification of the economy. It is contended that the petrochemicals industry is capable of contributing to this. It concludes that, while many opportunities have already been lost, attempts must be made to make the best use of opportunities offered by the Bongaigaon Petrochemical Complex.||Atul Goswami

There was also a failure to evaluate alternative class formations and class alignments in Indian rural society and their political implications. This paper argues that classical Marxist analysis of the development of capitalism in Europe cannot explain the development of capitalism in colonial social formations. The 'peripheral capitalism' in these countries differs structurally from 'metropolitan capitalism' as appropriation of surplus value and accumulation of capital takes place in the metropolis. Hence, where some form of a bourgeois revolution has been accomplished in some of these colonial formations by the intervention of metropolitan capitalism and where, consequently, one finds 'three fundamental classes', they are all located in the same mode of production and do not stand in irreconcilable contradiction to each other.||Hamza Alavi

He has also tried to provide more coherent political and economic development strategies for Bangladesh than had either of his predecessors. While his regime exhibits some similarities with Ayub Khan's Pakistan of the 1960s, or to Marcos's Philippines and Suharto's Indonesia, the mainsprings of Zia's thought and actions are indigenously Bangladeshi and uniquely his own. This article attempts to trace the contours of this 'Bangladeshi Nationalism' in its domestic and international dimensions and argues that Zia's successes or failures in the future will depend on his ability to become identified with this Bangladeshi nationalism that he has championed but has still not precisely defined.||Marcus Franda

The paper owes a great deal to Charles Bettelheim's path-breaking work on the USSR. The present paper is not an exercise in Sovietology or in Soviet history. Rather, following, Bettelheim's periodisation in the first two volumes of his work, the paper situates itself vis-a-vis the initial conditions in which Soviet social capitalism arose and eventually consolidated itself. This paper has been published in three parts. The first two parts analysed the important Marxist category of 'social capital' and set the rise of Soviet social capitalism within the context of the contradictions of the proletarian revolution in a backward (capitalist) economy. In this, the third part, the author touches on some of the theoretical issues recently raised concerning the nature of Soviet type society.||Paresh Chattopadhyay

After briefly reviewing the practice of sati in the past, the movement launched against it in 19th century Bengal by Indians and the intervention by the British government against the practice, it presents a detailed account of a recent case of sati in Jhadli village, Sikar district, Rajasthan. It tries to situate the incident in the context of the socio-economic conditions and the dominant ideology prevalent in the area. The paper finds that a hard core of religious belief which sustained the ideology governing sati in the past continues to persist in the region, though the emphasis is now not on the 'obligatory' nature of sati, but on its 'voluntariness'. It also considers the absence of a protest movement against Sati in the region as well as the relatively ineffective intervention of the State - both of which contrast with the situation in 19th century Bengal under the British.||K.

It is argued in this paper that while these factors are important preconditions for successful performance, they do not ensure the success of a development programme. What conventional wisdom does not take into account is 'strategic management', the set of top management interventions which leaders bring to bear on their development programmes. Specifically, there are certain critical interventions by the government and the programme leadership which provide the basic framework for operational decisions and set the pace for performance. This paper discusses the role of these critical interventions, or 'strategic management', with reference to six relatively successful national development programmes selected from different parts of the Third World.||Samuel Paul

1/11/1981- ||indian working class: some historical perspectives||4370380||'Industrial Unrest' and Growth of Labour Unions in Bengal, 1920-1924||Barring a few exceptions, in most cases the labour movement in Bengal spontaneously emerged as an inevitable manifestation of class struggle, a phenomenon about which the political leaders participating in the labour movement did not have a clear idea. From the account of the views of some of the prominent labour leaders of Bengal presented here, it becomes clear that their activities and the labour organisations formed and controlled by them did not reflect the true nature of class struggle inherent in the mode of production. A divergence of views of those being organised and those organising was therefore inevitable, and it began to grow with the passage of time. These leaders could not fill this growing gap. It was not lack of honesty or purpose, but their very mode of social existence and place in society that stood in the way. They therefore failed to respond to the new demands of labour. This void could be filled only by those who started building up labour organisations from grassroots, armed with the philosophy of Marxism. These people, ie, the communists, were just coming into the picture and the alien state, correctly assessing the significance of this new trend in the labour movement, quickly imprisoned the leaders of this trend in what is known as the Caunpore Conspiracy Case of 1924.||Sanat Bose

The attempt is considered timely, from two points of view: first, because the international political climate presently prevailing in the region stimulates new pressures for more resources to be put at the disposal of the military sector; and secondly, because the underutilisation of industrial capacity in the Indian economy also supports arguments for increased military expenditure. Apart from some brief remarks about the impact of increased military expenditure on economic development and distributional justice, the article confines itself mainly to an historical analysis of the macro-economic costs during the period under review. The period chosen is both important and illustrative: it was during this period that India's basic defence posture changed; and it was also during this period that the country stepped up its military expenditure, putting to use the industrial (over) capacity built up during the previous plan periods.||P.

The author argues that it is a real and live issue even today and needs exploration, especially since academic disciplines which ought to be concerned with it have, by and large, bypassed it. Most current theoretical economic formulations (implicitly) assume that the required degree of mathematical ability exists and proceed with their analyses. This, according to the author, is an unrealistic assumption to make at least in so far as the underdeveloped countries are concerned. The economic consequences of poor counting and calculating ability are discussed here in the context of the Warlis, one of the most backward among the tribals of Maharashtra and probably the poorest.||S.

Its chief concern is with the following problem: How is the relationship between peasants and capitalists structured by the given character of small peasant production as a system, and more specifically as a process? In the present paper this perspective is brought to bear on the notion of 'complementarity of interest' which, according to the captains of the industry, existed between the 'growers' and the 'millers' of sugarcane. In the first section the case as argued by the capitalists is set out, and the notion of the 'cane grower' is contested and replaced by that of a dependent peasantry. In the second section a set of basic contradictions between the dictates of small peasant production and the exigencies of capitalist enterprise are brought out. Finally, a detailed analysis of the shortchanging of the kisans by the factories is presented in the context of the mills' domination ofcane production.||Shahid Amin

26/12/1981- ||review of agriculture, december 1981||4370527||Capitalist Agriculture and Rural Classes in India||The debate over the 'mode of production in Indian agriculture' grew out of a milieu where scholars steeped in classic Marxist notions of feudalism, capitalism and imperialism confronted a changing empirical reality. In retrospect, it now appears that the data base of the whole debate was scanty, though by the 1960s, important economic changes in agriculture had been initiated, and the process of destroying pre-independence forms of landlordism and laying the foundations of an industrial and infrastructural development that could supply inputs to agriculture was beginning to produce real changes. But though Indian agriculture was becoming capitalist, the debate on the mode of production centred itself on the colonial period and failed to analyse the qualitatively different processes at work in the post-colonial phase. This article, which uses empirical data not available a decade ago, highlights the structure and characteristics of the main rural classes: capitalist farmers, middle peasants and semi-proletarianised poor peasants and labourers. Generally, it supports not the hesitant conclusions of most of the participants in the mode of production debate (including the present author) who stressed the dominance of 'semi-feudalism' and related forces holding back agricultural development; rather, it stresses the growth of capitalism in Indian agriculture and the growing links between agriculture and industry, the city and the countryside. But this is a capitalism that is developing within a post-colonial economy totally bound up with imperialism affected in specific ways by the disarticulation between small-scale capitalism and large-scale industry characteristic of such economies and by the still potent retrogressive impact of certain semi-feudal features of Indian social organisation, including caste and oppression of women.||Gail Omvedt

This native economy was dictated principally by a mode of production in which use value dominated exchange value, simple reproduction was the rule, and where the surplus was extracted under well-established direct and indirect extra-economic sections. The imposition of the plantation system on this native economy disrupted this mode of production without however in any way facilitating the emergence of more progressive forms of capitalist production. This paper examines some aspects of this impact of the colonial extraversion of Sri Lanka's economy on its peasantry.||N. Shanmugaratnam

First, by focussing on the structure of the industry and the different forms of relations of production existing in it, it highlights the characteristic of the so-called 'informal' sector and its links with the 'formal' sector and draws attention to the process, often deliberately resorted to by the employers, of informalisation of the industry. Secondly, it examines the structure and composition of the labour force and wages, especially those features arising out of the fact that the labour force in this industry is overwhelmingly female. Finally, in its account of the attempts at unionising the workers in this industry, it raises some crucial questions on the unionisation of workers in small industries in general.||U. Kalpagam

However, on the completion of these projects, there was a considerable gap between the potential capacity and their utilisation. The Command Area Development programme was formulated by the Central government to solve the problem of underutilisation. However, the performance of the Command Area Development Agencies, covering 71 projects all over the country, has been disappointing. The main reason for the failure of the CAD has been that, while it looks into and seeks to remedy the technical deficiencies of the irrigation projects, it fails to take account of and cope with the institutional reasons for the underutilisation or to remedy the problem of inequitable distribution of water resources among the various socio-economic groupings of farmers.||Niranjan Pant

However, even after accepting the model together with Sukhatme's propositions about the distribution of different elements of intake as well as the joint distribution of intake and requirement, the authors argue for a cut-off line of calorie intake for measurement of poverty which is different from (mostly higher than) that advocated by Sukhatme.||Santi K.

Workers in modern small scale industry have been a largely neglected branch of the Indian industrial system. A study devoted to them fills a gap in our knowledge and at the same time serves as an evaluation of the assumptions on which policies for the development of small scale industry are based. The basic features of such policies are "to create jobs for the mass of population and to provide for basic needs". From the material presented in this paper, a number of observations relevant to these policies are apparent: (1) there is an almost complete lack of legal protection for workers in small scale industry; (2) their wages are low; (3) they occupy a subordinate position; (4) their ranks are divided; and (5) labour union leadership tends to increase this divisiveness rather than promote solidarity. Finally, how do small scale industry workers fit into the production system as a whole? The author rejects the approach which distinguishes the formal from the informal sector. But if the conceptional pair, informal-formal, provides insufficient insight into the position which small scale industry workers occupy in the production system, is there another set of concepts which can better characterise this position? [This is the final part of the paper which has been published in three parts.]||Hein Streefkerk
24/1/1981- ||special articles||4369463||Realities of Agrarian Relations in India||Any relationship registers a complementary aspect at a point in time and a contradictory aspect over a period in time. Complement or contradiction in a relational matrix is unilaterally stressed according to one's ideological construct to appraise reality. One aspect of contradiction may also be emphasised at the expense of other related aspects in accordance with one's theoretical orientation. These attempts, based on the deductive-positivistic approach to 'sciencing' a phenomenon, distort or obscure the understanding of social reality. This paper attempts to illustrate some of these problems with respect to the realities of agrarian relations and with specific reference to Indian society from the time of the Raj to date.||Ramkrishna Mukherjee

Drawing heavily from the latest Report of the Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and of the Commissioner for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, this article details the crucial factors that have contributed to these disabilities - lack of education or even literacy, lack of employment opportunities and occupational mobility, indebtedness humiliating conditions of life and work, social oppression - and suggests various practical ways in which these can be mitigated. Specifically, it offers various suggestions towards strengthening the office of the Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes as well as the creation and (where they exist) strengthening of corresponding agencies in the states.||L.

30/5/1981- ||review of management, may 1981||4369883||Regulation of Trade Association Activities||Trade associations have been instrumental in a number of restrictive trade practices by various manufacturers or traders - particularly price fixing in concert, collective boycott, exclusion from association membership, and restricting persons to whom goods are sold. Such associations mainly operated in the distributive trade of consumer goods and the provisions of commercial services such as transport, advertising and custom clearing and forwarding. The MRTP Commission has taken a serious view in all the cases of restrictive trade practices brought before it. However, the number of trade associations whose activities have been examined by the Commission constitute an insignificant fraction of the total number of associations operating in India. Specific and comprehensive provisions should be made in the MRTP Act to prohibit the anti-competitive activities of the trade associations. Moreover, the Commission should aggressively probe such activities, and should not wait for a complaint or reference made to it.||D. P. S. Verma

After sketching the main outlines of the pre-1934 history of the textile industry and its working class in Bombay, the paper discusses the Bombay Trade Disputes Concilation Act, 1934, by which government instituted a 'labour officer'. The creation of this office was ostensibly intended to correct and combat the abuses that had crept into the field of labour recruitment as also to attend to the grievances of the working class. But the way in which this office actually functioned shows that while the labour officer was more successful in undermining the trade union leaders (by more or less usurping their functions) - and in the process making those trade union leaders who sought the labour officer's assistance in resolving labour disputes lose credibility in the eyes of the majority of the workers - he was far less successful in eliminating the abuses in labour recruitment as exemplified in the institution of jobbers. The overall result of the policy was retardation of the growth of an organised working class movement which, at least in the case of the affected communist-affiliated unions, was the explicit intention of the government.||Dick Kooiman

Stemming from this has grown the notion that there can be not only export-oriented growth but also export-oriented employment generation. This article analyses the actual role played in employment creation by the various export items and export-oriented sectors. It comes to the conclusion that not only does export growth not lead to employment creation but that the role which exports can play in employment creation is merely to yield foreign exchange for importing items immediately required for investment which, in turn, can create employment. Indeed, even here, the role of indiscriminate imports in undermining employment generation needs to be looked into.||Sumitra Chishti

So far, most studies of the FWP have been primarily empirical.

Its emphasis is mainly on issues relating to distribution, and the increasing of the purchasing power of the poorest segments of the population. Its findings are that by the turn of the century, even under the most optimistic conditions of economic development, about 18 crore people depending on agriculture will be living below the poverty line. The problems of these Indian poor cannot be solved within agriculture because this sector cannot by itself provide enough employment and income.||Ifzal Ali,B. M. Desai,R. Radhakrishna,V. S. Vyas

It traces the origins and growth of morden education in Bengal since the colonial intervention and notes that the historically exclusivist character of modern Bengali language and the existing system of education has meant that the benefits of modern education, including those accruing out of learning Bengali as it has evolved in the nineteenth century, have been appropriated by the 'middle order'. Viewed thus, both the introduction of Sahaj Path, in 1969 by the united front government and the preparation of the new primer in 1980 by the left front government only appear as measures meant to help the masses; and the opposition parties have only taken advantage of the inconsistencies and contradictions in government's policy and have made an issue of Sahaj Path because it is likely to sell best.||Poromesh Acharya

The Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969, which is viewed as "perhaps the most drastic" of land reform legislations in the country, has given Kerala the reputation of being the model in this respect. The Act envisages three schemes. Two of these at least have been efficiently implemented. And they have been implemented by parties committed to promote the interests of the peasantry and in a land of peasant activism. Nevertheless, an analysis of the Act's scope and the consequences of its implementation reveals that, far from seeking to emulate the case of Kerala, other states should draw lessons from its failures.||P.

Faced with these problems, the government's annual budgets threaten to become a strenuous exercise in maintaining investment at the same level in real terms. One would have to evaluate the decision to run a large deficit in 1981-82 vis-a-vis the alternative of a lower level of investment. Deficit financing in 1981-82 must also be seen in the context of the likely improvement in supplies of agricultural and industrial goods. Bearing in mind the several constraints which restrict the policy options open to the Finance Minister, the main elements of the strategy adopted in the Budget, namely, allocation of sizeable amounts for infrastructure, eschewing indiscriminate indirect tax imposts, relief to salaried tax-payers and a moderate reduction in corporate tax rates, reflects a degree of calculated risk taken in an attempt to make the best of a bad bargain.||N.

It argues that the caste and geographical spread of the violence is closely related to the social mobility of the affected scheduled caste population. Taking literacy, education and employment as indicators of social mobility, and scheduled caste concentration in a particular area as a factor inducing hostility, the paper shows how it is precisely those sections of the scheduled castes who are relatively better educated, more mobile and have some access to jobs thathave been most seriously affected by the present caste riots; similarly, the areas thus affected also show a relative concentration of the scheduled castes.||Pradip Kumar Bose

The incorporation of a joint declaration on restrictive practices in the Third Bipartite Settlement in the banking industry was a significant development in this context. However, bank managements have so far evinced little determination to make use of the joint declaration to put an end to restrictive practices.||S. K. Datta

The author tries to substantiate this contention in terms of precisely those agrarian programmes of the West Bengal government which are being publicised as the most significant achievements of the ruling Front, namely, Operation Barga, Panchayati Raj, and the Food for Work Programme. The author also briefly reviews other programmes which have not been taken up by the Left Front government and over which the government has maintained total silence. These programmes are: enforcement of ceiling laws and confiscation of land above the ceilings for distribution among landless peasants, imposition of tax on agricultural income, and enforcement of minimum wages for agricultural workers.||Ashok Rudra

Workers in modern small scale industry have been a largely neglected branch of the Indian industrial system. A study devoted to them fills a gap in our knowledge and at the same time serves as an evaluation of the assumptions on which policies for the development of small scale industry are based. The basic features of such policies are "to create jobs for the mass of population and to provide for basic needs". From the material presented in this paper, a number of observations relevant to these policies are apparent: (1) there is an almost complete lack of legal protection for workers in small scale industry; (2) their wages are low; (3) they occupy a subordinate position; (4) their ranks are divided; and (5) labour union leadership tends to increase this divisiveness rather than promote solidarity. Finally, how do small scale industry workers fit into the production system as a whole? The author rejects the approach which distinguishes the formal from the informal sector. But if the conceptional pair, informal-formal, provides insufficient insight into the position which small scale industry workers occupy in the production system, is there another set of concepts which can better characterise this position?

28/3/1981- ||review of agriculture, march 1981||4369642||Tenancy and Mode of Production||This paper examines the significance of tenancy as a relation of production in agriculture and, in that process, criticises the widespread, almost universal, assumption in Indian writing on the question that tenancy is necessarily and integrally a characteristic of pre-capitalist relations, often described by sections of the Left as 'semi-feudal'. The paper is in three parts. Part I, which discusses various theories of tenancy, shows that there is no sanction in the writings of Marx or Lenin to the view that tenancy is necessarily a feudal feature. Tenancy as an arrangement is quite flexible and has historically taken different forms and has embodied different mixtures of capitalist and pre-capitalist relations under different historical conditions. Parts II and III provide evidence in support of this thesis from the history of the development of capitalism in western Europe and from developments in contemporary India.||Aparajita Chakraborty

These are that the agricultural land market in India is largely a tenancy market. The heterogeneity of tenants, resulting largely from the rather recent emergence of large farmers as tenants, may further complicate tenancy policies enacted in order to help the poor. The emergence of large farmers as tenants may not only adversely affect small-farm tenants but lead to concentration of land otherwise prevented by ceilings on owned land. The terms of tenancy were found to be highly flexible and responsive to the resource positions of the two parties and midseason contingencies faced by them. Tenancy tended to equalise the land/bullock ratios but not the land/family labour ratios of tenants and landowners. To a lesser extent tenancy also tended to induce or facilitate interlinked transactions in other agricultural factor markets, particularly for credit.||N. S. Jodha

This paper examines various extant theories of violence put forward by social scientists and finds that none of them can fully explain urban violence in socially and culturally specific situations. The point is elaborated in an account of the incidents of urban violence involving 'untouchables' on the one side and caste hindus and the police on the other in Agra city in April 1978. It shows that contrary to much theoretical thinking, there was order in the disorder, an element of rationality and deliberation in the Agra riots. In other words, urban violence, the paper argues, can be orderly, culturally normative and quite rational.||Owen M. Lynch

Its findings are that the management style in these family businesses is highly autocratic. Authority and decision-making powers are centralised and the family head is also the head of the firm. All decisions are arrived at after consultations with the patriarch; at the same time, these are arrived at 'informally' and hardly any policy decision is formally put down in writing. However, despite such unorthodox, even archaic, management practices, these family businesses have done extremely well and the Calcutta firm studied shows an unbroken record of high productivity and industrial peace. In view of this the paper asks whether it can be argued that the content and style of management followed in these family businesses present an ideal 'model' for Indian industry in general.||K. K.

There are currently about 150 such firms, employing some 20,000 engineers and technologists, and covering almost all areas of process and product engineering. Their technological competence can be gauged from the fact that both the public and private sector CEDOs have achieved some successes in the export market in competition with the better and longer established foreign firms. Yet, in spite of gaining such recognition for their capability and expertise, Indian CEDOs still appear to have a problem of credibility with both the government and operating companies in India. This paper suggests that Indian CEDOs are underutilised in investment projects within the country and that the policies, practices and procedures of the government, financial institutions and the operating companies have not been effective in accelerating the use of domestic CEDOs and in improving the quality of their work.||Jairam Ramesh

Effective February 8, JPC base prices of steel (for railhead) have been marked up by a substantial 20 per cent and of pig iron by 37.6 per cent. The second equally important decision announced a fortnight later is the decontrol of prices of bars, rods and semis. Given the importance of steel and the precedent these steps would set for pricing of the products of public sector units, a discussion of the soundness of the two decisions would be rewarding.||S. V.

1/11/1981- ||1981 census||4370375||Indian Population Scene after 1981 Census: A Perspective||The 1981 census has enumerated almost 684 million Indians. The average annual growth rate during the 1970s was 2.23 per cent, slightly higher than in the 1960s. The expectation of a decline in the growth rate during the 1970s has thus not been fulfilled. The count exceeds the projection used for the Sixth Five Year Plan by 12 million or about 2 per cent. This seems minor, but its implications for the long-run prospects of Indian population are quite serious. International migration is not a significant factor in the dynamics of India's population; also, on balance, there has been net emigration. There is no evidence to support the speculation that mortality decline during the 1970s has been faster than projected; in fact it has probably been slower. The differential in the quality of the 1971 and 1981 censuses is also unlikely to be a significant factor contributing to a spurious impression of a steady or accelerating growth rate. Fertility, however, seems to have declined more slowly than projected; and the average annual birth rate during the 1970s was between 37 and 39, with the upper limit of the range not an unlikely possibility (compared to the projected rate of a little below 35). The average death rate was between 15 and 17 (compared to the projected rate of 14). The difference between the total enumerated population and the projected figure is likely to be concentrated in the age group 0-9, i e, the survivors of children born after the 1971 census. As a result, the number of children of schoolgoing ages was 4 to 8 per cent higher than projected for 1981; the difference would probably increase to between 9 and 19 per cent in 1986. In states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan, the relative difference between the actual and projected number of children would be even larger. The planned outlays for primary school education as well as for post-natal and preventive health care for children, therefore, need upward revision. The most serious implications of the 1981 census relate to the likely future pace of decline in fertility and the challenging task before the family planning programme personnel. The long-term goal of lowering fertility to the replacement level by 1996 seems unrealistic and a total population of nearly one billion by 2001 AD appears almost inescapable. The 1981 census results have stimulated a revival of political support for the family planning programme. Yet 'revamping' or 'revitalising' of the programme will be very difficult, partly because of its bureaucratisation. Compulsion is neither appropriate nor feasible despite the enthusiastic support for it among people who are impatient with the slow process of change. Some judicious schemes of incentives and disincentives and more research for better contraceptives have a role to play, but their role is often overstated. On the other hand, the difficulty of educating the people about the consequences of their individual behaviour with respect to the number of children has been underestimated. Unfortunately, there are no feasible shortcuts in the immense task of slowing the growth rate of India's already very large population and a vigorous educational campaign aimed at both couples in the reproductive ages and young people in the age group 10 to 18 who will form families in the future is imperative.||Pravin Visaria,Leela Visaria

While not ignoring his fiction, it draws for the most part from the two journals that Dickens edited in the last twenty years of his life, Household Words (1850-59) and All the Year Round (1859-70). While Dickens was quite consistent in his championship of the underdog at home, he could envisage with equanimity the exploitation of several million fellow British subjects in the colonies. The contradiction between commitment to domestic liberty and indifference to repressive imperial authority abroad does not seem to have posed any serious problems for Dickens. Perhaps, this absence in Dickens of any fundamental questioning of the Empire only reflects the attitude of all good middle class Englishmen of his period; but being a self-avowed educator as well as the most influential and widely read novelist of his times, Dickens must also be held responsible for the persistence and extension of some of these attitudes even today. It is especially necessary for Indian readers to be aware of this aspect of Charles Dickens, though such an awareness need not detract from the enriching and entertaining insights his work provides into his own period and society.||Sajni Mukherji

Its main conclusion is that fertility declines are occurring in at least seven of the main states, and very possibly several more. Also, despite appearances to the contrary, the real underlying rate of population growth has very probably slowed during the last decade. Therefore, so far as fertility trends are concerned, the census results' warrant a posture of cautious optimism, rather than one of consternation or dismay.||Tim Dyson

On the other hand, some people argue that the present system of income taxation in India is such that it enables a large number of companies to manage their tax function such that they end up paying little or no taxes on their incomes. The purpose of this paper is to take a close look at the way two large Indian companies have managed their tax functions. This is done with a view to getting some idea of how high the incidence of corporate income taxation in India really is. The two companies are: Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company and Reliance Textile Industries. It is clear that the income-tax system in India has many provisions that help growing companies to reduce their tax liability to zero.||Anand P. Gupta

These studies rely for the most part on three sources of data to cross-check casual observations: studies of particular scheduled caste communities sample surveys; and studies of differences in election results between reserved and non-reserved constituencies. This paper, which uses statistical correlations between scheduled caste population density of constituencies and corresponding levels of voter participation or partisan support questions some of the assumptions held about 'bloc voting' by the scheduled castes and argues that what is striking about their voting behaviour is not a lack of autonomy, but a certain vitality and independence, which however is not without fragmentation and frustration.||Barbara R.

04/7/1981- ||special articles||4369993||Autonomy and Organisation: Harijan and Adivasi Protest Movements||Peasants in general and poor peasants in particular are often represented as fulfilling one or other of the two stereotypes: clients and subordinates of an elite, and often non-peasant, nucleus of organisers, or engaging in 'spontaneous' but self-destructive acts, lacking any organisational structure or sense of direction. However, of late, the poorest sections of Indian peasantry, specifically Harijans and Adivasis, have begun to act autonomously under the leadership and organisation of militants drawn from among themselves. This paper seeks to demonstrate, by reference to two agitations in Bihar in the 1930s involving in the one case Musahars (Harijans) and in the other Santals (Adivasis), that the kind of 'autonomy' currently associated with such protest movements is very much in the tradition of protest movements launched in earlier generations.||Stephen Henningham

04/4/1981- ||special articles||4369677||Family Planning: Numbers Game Goes On||After a period of relative calm, in recent months there has been a spurt of official pronouncements on the population problem in India and the ways in which it is being sought to be solved - mainly through even larger fund allocations for the family planning programme. But such proposals ignore the socio-economic and cultural reality of the clients of the programme, which dictates that in the present circumstances it is rational for a couple to have more children than the government wishes it to have. This oversight is best reflected in the unrealistic targets that the family planning programme has consistently set itself, targets that have grown more ambitious with each failure to meet them. This paper examines one aspect of the reality which places a premium on fertility - the health standards of the population, improvements in which have come to a virtual standstill, and the status may even be actually deteriorating according to some observers. Yet the health sector has been, financially at least, receiving less and less relative attention in successive Plans, with the aid to the family planning component in this sector increasing rapidly, culminating now in the Sixth Plan allotting to family planning Rs 1,010 crore of the Rs 2831 crore set apart for health and family planning during 1980-85.||Alaka Malwade Basu

Real national income, measured in 1970-71 prices, fell by about 5 per cent in 1979-80, compared to the previous year; there was an ever sharper fall in real per capita income of the order of 6.8 per cent. Despite this gloomy situation, the paper argues, it is possible that the process of capital accumulation in industry will enable the economy to move into a trajectory of relatively higher growth. The paper examines the various ways in which capital reorganisation is taking place in Indian industry. But distributive justice will be missing in such growth as will occur. For the millions of the Indian poor, particularly in the rural sector, the future cannot hold much hope.||Sudipto Mundle

Part IV tries to put these views within an ideological perspective. It is argued that transnationals have a specific approach and that disagreement with them leads to a completely different way of dealing with the small industry questions.||Vinod Vyasulu

24/1/1981- ||special articles||4369465||Why Vietnam Invaded Kampuchea||The invasion and occupation of Kampuchea was only one aspect of Vietnam's general policy of building up, by force if necessary, an 'Indochina bloc' conceived of as a system of compulsory and permanent 'friendship and co-operation' in furtherance of Vietnam's national unity and 'socialist' development. Again, Hanoi's consummation of an all-embracing alliance with the Soviet Union in 1978 was no sudden and involuntary reaction to the 'Chinese threat' but a qualitatively new alignment tailored to the requirements of asserting Vietnam's 'leadership' over Indochina and, specifically, for solving the thorny 'Kampuchean problem' once for all. Kampuchea itself was not at all a minor issue for Vietnam, but almost a life-and-death matter, both because of its intrinsic importance as an integral and indispensable part of Indochina (as the crucial agricultural 'hinterland' for Vietnam's industrial revolution) and, more important, because of the fierce nationalism and stubborn defiance of Kampuchea which could jeopardise Vietnam's entire Indochina project. Vietnam's decision to assume direct physical control of Kampuchea was, and remains, an extremely costly business in every respect, and the normally prudent and sensible authorities in Hanoi would not have embarked upon such a risky venture except as a desperate measure of last resort.||Jitendra Mohan

This approach, however, does not adequately perceive the connections between poverty and unemployment. This paper aims to show that low income employment cannot be overcome without adequate intersectoral shifts of labour. It shows how employment and income targets can be properly integrated using suitable asset and income distribution links. Section I shows the interconnections between poverty and unemployment. Section II highlights some features of income and employment structure relevant to employment policy. A model of intersectoral shifts of labour is presented in Section III. Section IV draws certain conclusions for policy.||J. N. Sinha

Despite the remedial proposals and their reiterations, national bourgeois goals have continued to take precedence over the 'norms' of behaviour stipulated under NIEO. This paper analyses the context, formulation and progress of the NIEO proposals. It concludes that, in the present balance of international economic strength, world-scale reform of international economic relations, through partial reforms as envisaged under NIEO, is unlikely to take place.||Sunanda Sen

20/6/1981-27/6/1981||special article||4369973||Rise of Social Capitalism in the USSR: II||This paper attempts to discuss some aspects of the rise of the Soviet social capitalism in the context of the specific contradictions of the transition period between capitalism and socialism (the first phase of communism) following the seizure of power by the proletariat in a backward capitalist country. The paper owes a great deal to Charles Bettelheim's path-breaking work on the USSR. The present paper is not an exercise in Sovietology or in Soviet history. Rather, following, Bettelheim's periodisation in the first two volumes of his work, the paper situates itself vis-a-vis the initial conditions in which Soviet social capitalism arose and eventually consolidated itself. The paper is published in three parts. The first part, published last week, analysed the important Marxist category of 'social capital'. The second part, which appears below, sets the rise of Soviet social capitalism within the context of the contradictions of the proletarian revolution in a backward (capitalist) economy. Part three, to appear next week, will touch on some of the theoretical issues recently raised concerning the nature of Soviet type society.||Paresh Chattopadhyay

Does the nutritional minimum involve a range of calories, each associated with a different mix of the food groups? Is there a given minimum of each nutrient which must be consumed for securing adequate nutrition and which does not permit inter-changeability or trade-off against each other? These are all questions which need answering if we want to use nutritional criteria for determining food production and distribution policies; and they also become relevant when considering food technology for the purpose of making up deficits in needed nutrients other than just calories.||V.

22/8/1981- ||special articles||4370140||Bangladesh after Zia: A Retrospect and Prospect||The assassination of Ziaur Rahman dramatised the many ironies of his life and political career. By his own admission, 406 military officers were executed, during his regime; and yet, he could not eliminate all opposition and was finally himself killed by a group of officers who were known to be opposed to him, but whom he failed to discipline. He was entirely ruthless against his opponents; but the circumstance of his assassination suggest a relaxation of the security apparatus and an almost naive belief in his powers of persuasion. This paper examines the circumstances that surrounded the assassination of Zia and briefly considers the prospect for the future. While the military establishment has been further strengthened by the developments in Bangladesh, the dilemmas confronting the military, which are the same as those faced by Zia and which he was attempting to resolve, continue. While there has been an appearance of orderly succession and re-establishment of the political process, the appearance of order conceals and covers up problems which the military is, by definition, unable to solve.||Marcus Franda

28/11/1981- ||review of management, november 1981||4370427||Utilisation of Indigenous Technology: Organisational and Policy Constraints||The appartus of production, development, control and distribution of industrial innovation in India has been worked out on the premise that increased state activity would gradually stimulate conditions for technological change. The private sector enters the innovation chain mainly as the biggest target consumer group of state sector-developed industrial innovations. Its constribution to either expenditure or the actual conduct of industrial research is negligible and therefore it has almost no stake in the success of indigenous know-how. The mechanisms for control of import of know-how have a dual advantage for Indian private capital. First, the dominant section of Indian private capital can maintain its position in the local market by being able to import innovation at a suitable moment. Secondly, since the entire negotiation over foreign technical collaboration takes place within state specified stipulations and controls, the influential section of Indian private capital can effectively bargain for more liberal terms in the matter of actual ownership and control. The dominant section of private capital can thus maintain its foothold in the domestic market vis-a-vis foreign capital without having to do research and innovate itself and without having a stake in state-funded industrial research ventures. Although Indian private capital can still stimulate itself by importing innovations from time to time, no innovative skills and innovative research capacities would form in the private sector and simultaneously the utility of state efforts would be continuously reduced.||Prabir Mitra

One of these elements is derived from a critique of the fundamental conceptions of liberal political thought - the separation of state and civil society and the notion of representation. Colletti's emphasis on Rousseau's criticism of civil society is, in this regard, crucial. An even more basic element characterising the political foundations of a capitalist economy is found in Marx's concept of abstract labour, which specifies the essential content of bourgeois equality and freedom. Taken together, these two elements can constitute a foundamental critique of bourgeois political theory, as well as of the politics of revisionism. However, Colletti's treatment of Rousseau fails to identify a fundamental theoretical inadequacy in the latter's critique of civil society. Colletti's failure is, in fact, related to a much more fundamental misconception about the dialectical method and about the purposes of science.||Partha Chatterjee

The author suggests an alternative method which seeks to do away with some of the assumptions underlying the current method. Estimates made using the new method stand up better to comparison with other independent estimates than estimates prepared using the current method. Though it may not be the ideal solution, the new method thus seems to be based on firmer grounds than the current method.||N. Shanta

09/5/1981- ||special articles||4369809||Characteristics of Female Employment: Implications of Research and Policy||While it is now generally conceded that growth in itself will not necessarily ensure that its benefits will 'trickle down' to the poorest and the weakest, it is not equally appreciated that policies to reduce unemployment and promote expansion of employment opportunities in themselves do not necessarily lead to an inprovement in female employment. However it is still not considered relevant to consider female employment as a separate and specific category despite the fact that the 9 crore women workers in India constitute 33 per cent of the total workforce and their share of unemployment (40 per cent) is higher than their share in the labour force. This paper attempts to highlight how the women's employment situation differs from the male employment situation and why it is necessary to consider female employment separately in formulating employment policies. The paper is in four parts. Part I briefly reviews the reasons why female employment and unemployment are underestimated. Part II discusses the factors determining female participation rates and the supply of female labour and how they are different from those determining male participation. Part III analyses in detail some of the distinctive characteristics of the demand for female labour and Part IV discusses the implication of these differences for the design of programmes and policies affecting female employment.||Pushpa Sundar

First, there has been a significant shift in the regional distribution of party support. This has resulted in the Congress party, which had traditionally relied on its disproportionate support in the 'Hindi heartland', moving towards a 'southern strategy' Secondly, the minorities bloc support to the Congress can no more be taken for granted. Finally, the Congress itself, as also other parties, have experienced a progressive de-institutionalisation. This paper examines the first two features of this shift in Indian politics.||Lloyd I.

(i) The coverage of the Operation Flood II is higher in the more developed states. (ii) The choice of districts made for implementing the Operation Flood II programme is such that there is a systematic bias towards more developed districts. (iii) The coverage of the programme is neither biased towards regions having high unemployment rate nor is it biased towards regions with low level of per capita expenditures of the weaker sections. (iv) The implementation of the programme, as it stands, is likely to aggravate inter-regional inequalities.||Surendar Singh,R. K. Sharma

The conception and strategy of the TCOs is discussed in Section I. The activities and operations of eight TCOs are, analysed in Section II, while the response of the assisted enterprises to the TCOs' services and their comparative performance are indicated in Section III. Some suggestions are made in Section IV to improve the effectiveness of the TCO network. The characteristics of the experiment that have relevance for other less developed countries are analysed in the final section.||V. V. Bhatt

It was at best an act of crisis management. It was forced on the government by an industrial collapse resulting largely from government policies themselves. Post-nationalisation industrial development can hardly be said to have justified the social aims of nationalisation. Besides, nationalisation does not amount to socialism. The measure has served merely to strengthen the interests of state capitalism as such. It is difficult as yet to state, evidentially, whether it has had the effect of serving the interests of the ruling classes in the country. [This paper is being published in two parts. The first part which appeared last week reviewed the performance of the coal industry in the two decades prior to nationalisation. The second part below examines the validity of the official arguments for takeover, and describes and analyses the real causes which led to the nationalisation of coal.]||Rajiv Kumar

Specifically, it goes into the question of the role and responsibilities of executive and non-executive directors of a Board, and the relationship between the Chairman of the Board of Directors and its members. It also discusses the role of the 'professional' non-executive directors whose services are often requisitioned but who are not sufficiently compensated. The paper notes the claim that the restrictive regulatory environment in India comes in the way of adequately compensating professional non-executive directors, but shows that even within the limits imposed by the Companies Act, such directors can be adequately compensated. The paper concludes with suggesting a framework for effective functioning of the Board, along the lines argued in the paper.||S. K. Bhattacharya

It focuses on the thought of Mohammad Iqbal, poet and philosopher, and its impact on the shaping and sharpening of the identities of the Muslims of the sub-continent. It argues that though Iqbal is considered as the spiritual father of Pakistan, he also wanted to reconcile the demands of 'Indian nationalism' with the anxieties of Muslims - not so much of the whole sub-continent, but of that part which now forms Pakistan - to preserve their identity. It is therefore unfortunate that any discussion of Iqbal's historic contribution is coloured by either a desire to credit him for the 'achievement' of Pakistan, or exonerate (or blame) him for that 'guilt'. This paper, instead, points to the relevance Iqbal's thought continues to have not merely for Muslims in India, but also for the future of Indian nationalism as perceived by the majority of non-Muslims.||Balraj Puri

05/9/1981- ||special articles||4370196||Muslim Educational Backwardness: An Inferential Analysis||The central argument of this paper is that the explanations often advanced to account for the educational backwardness of Muslims in contemporary India rest upon certain questionable assumptions. These are, one, that Muslims are an aggregate community; and two, that the appeal of education is universal to all social strata. Following from this, if indeed Muslims are educationally backward, it is because of some innate religious conservatism which discourages pursuit of secular education, or because of an acute 'minority complex'. This paper questions these assumptions and argues that educational opportunities are likely to be exploited in any community by those sections that are oriented to employment in the professions and services. Amongst the Muslims, this social strata has not only been historically quite small, but was further reduced in size in the wake of the creation of Pakistan. The educational backwardness of Indian Muslims should therefore be attributed not to any 'religious fanaticism' or 'minority complex' but to the small size of the social strata whose members can be expected to seek educational opportunities.||Imtiaz Ahmad

1/11/1981- ||indian working class: some historical perspectives||4370378||Kanpur Textile Labour: Some Structural Features of Formative Years||What emerges from this study of the Kanpur labour force is a picture which is in many ways different from that of Bombay, analysed by Morris David Morris. While the institution of caste, the rural link, or the absence of a 'work ethic' did not hinder the process of industrialisation, Morris tends to underestimate, if not deny, the importance of these aspects. The study of the Kanpur workforce suggests the contrary: while the 'rigidity' of caste and community bonds were weakening, they did have a significance in the lives of the workers; ties with the village were not ruptured, and were essential to the workers' existence. The phenomenon of absenteeism - the visit back home - was not only economically necessary for the workers' survival, it was the only relief from the drudgery of work and unhealthy conditions of city life and an occasion for family reunion, enjoyment and participation in festivities. The underlying assumption of Morris David Morris, as of many others, is that the process of industrialisation necessarily leads to a dissolution of earlier forms of social relations and institutions. This assumption is not universally valid. Capital can develop on the basis of existing social institutions by subordinating, restructuring and integrating them to its own needs. This in fact seems to have been characteristic of backward industrialisation.||Chitra Joshi

19/12/1981- ||special articles||4370503||Caste, Infrastructure and Superstructure: A Critique||The question whether it is 'caste' or 'class' that constitutes the primary level of reality in Indian society has been one of the constant concerns of Indian sociology. The two important contending approaches are the 'culturological' approach which argues that caste is a primordial reality of Indian society and everything else springs from it; and various 'Marxist' approaches which, while recognising the importance of caste, question the theoretical and historical assumptions underlining the 'culturological' approach. The most lucid and influential exponent of the thesis of caste as primordial reality is the French sociologist, Louis Dumont. A measure of the influence of Dumont's views can be had in the fact that a Marxist critic of Dumont, Maurice Godelier, in arguing that caste is part of the 'infrastructure', apparently taking a middle position between those who argue that caste is part of the sub-structure and those who argue that is part of the superstructure, ends up finally with views virtually similar to those held by Dumont. This paper undertakes a critique of the 'culturological' school and also critically reviews Godelier's anthropollgy and its bearing on Indian society. It shows how, even though starting from different theoretical premises, both Dumont and Godelier tend to agree on the pre-eminence of caste as the determining factor of social reality in India.||Dipankar Gupta

The approximation is shown to be robust with respect to both heterogeneity in input-output ratios and aggregation, under reasonable assumptions. Two mutually conflicting hypotheses, one which posits no technical substitution possibility and the other which allows for smooth substitution and, hence, choice of input combinations with respect to varying prices, are thus demonstrated to lead to the same empirical observational material. The empirical basis of theories that go along with a Cobb-Douglas production function can be seen to be weak in this light.||N. Krishnaji

This article disputes these claims and shows that official enrolment statistics bear little relation to actual attendance of students in the classrooms; that enrolment figures are often inflated because there is so much more money for a state making vast enrolment claims. The article presents, after making the necessary statistical corrections, the actual progress in education registered since Independence and concludes that even universal primary education - five years of compulsory schooling - would be a remarkable achievement if it were to be attained by the turn of the century.||John Kurien

Its findings are that the experience of the Left Front government in the matter of tenancy reforms lays bare the limitations of reformist measures in a class society. In fact, even though the measures adopted by the Left Front government sought only a slight rearrangement of property relations in the rural areas, well within the limitations imposed by bourgois property rights, they have faced formidable obstacles; and even the limited success claimed for the programme by government leaders might turn out to be illusory in the event of the present government's replacement either by dismissal or by being defeated in the polls.||Ratan Khasnabis

These trends were not mutually exclusive. The ideology of many Khilafat leaders, as articulated by a section of the ulama, was an important strand in Muslim political thought which provided sustenance to Muslim separatism in the 1940s. The pan-Islamic upsurge, which emphasised the political and religious unity of all Muslims, was symptomatic of a new found communal consciousness and confidence which, combined with other factors, were to sweep many Muslims into a ready acceptance of the two-nation theory. In this respect, the Khilafat campaign was not only based on a wrong and romantic ideology, but was also a landmark in the evolution of a separate Muslim identity.||Mushirul Hasan

It argues that the system of reservations, even though introduced by the State, has now become a weapon in the hands of the various deprived groups in their struggle against socially entrenched upper caste and upper class interests. These sections want to maintain the social and economic status quo under the cover of seemingly progressive ideology and demand that 'merit' and not 'caste' should be the determining factor in higher education, jobs, promotions, etc. In insisting upon reservations and by adhering to what might appear as a particularist ideology, the scheduled castes and tribes and other socially disadvantaged groups are actually attempting to break this status quo.||I.

It considers the features specific to the jute industry which contributed to the growth of trade union consciousness among the jute mill workers, such as the nature and composition of the jute labour force, the structure of the industry and the location of the jute mills in a relatively compact area on the banks of the Hooghly. It also examines briefly some of the other factors that affected the attempts by the jute mill workers to build trade unions and considers, in this context, the conflicts between British and Indian interests in jute industry and jute trade, the lack of homogeneity among the jute mill labour force, and the role of the leadership of the nationalist movement. The article concludes with a brief consideration of the major strikes organised in the jute industry in 1937 and 1938, the role of the unions led by the Congress Socialist Party and the Communists during these strikes and the broader differences in political perspectives that these strikes highlighted. An important failure of the leadership of jute mill workers during this period, the author suggests, was the lack of recognition of the intimate links between jute mill workers and jute growers. In jute, specifically, the organic links between the struggle of the jute growers and jute mill workers was not clearly perceived by the communist party whose trade union activities among the jute mill workers was, therefore, to some extent superficial during the period under review.||Ira Mitra

In order to draw some firm conclusions about the trends of growth in agriculture, the author argues, one should not restrict oneself to agricultural output alone, but should also analyse the trends that might be there in other economic variables related to agricultural production by backward and forward linkages.||Maitreyi Chaudhuri

The debate has taken the form of agitation and counter-agitation. 'Abolition' of English has become a political scare and also a political scoring-point. If the objective is to improve education by making assimilation easier, impact more widespread and coverage more meaningful, the action must be positive rather than negative, involving construction rather than 'abolition' -and this applies to all stages from the primary to the most advanced. If instead of looking at the picture as a whole in the perspectives of contemporaneous links and of growth over time, we simply begin by 'abolishing' something, we may end up by really abolishing many things else.||Bhabatosh Datta

In the first section of this paper an attempt has been made to briefly indicate from historical experience the course of this self-defeating search in the Permanent Settlement region of Eastern India with specific reference to West Bengal. In section II, the paper presents an evaluative report on the progress of Land Reforms connected with the ascendance of leftwing political forces in the state culminating in a juridically comprehensive enactment, i e, the West Bengal Land Reforms Amendment Act (1979).||Nripen Bandyopadhyaya

This attempt is made on the basis of a study of certain long-term trends converging towards an intensification of labour-capital conflict in the Bombay textile industry and a detailed analysis of a nodal point, the strike actions of 1928-29. The paper questions some current notions about the 'irrationality' of working-class behaviour faced with technological change. An attempt it also made to study the processes accentuating the 'transparency' of class conflict and solidarity of class organisations in the context of the complex interaction between capital, labour and the colonial State. Finally, the paper explores the factors which account for the occlusion of working class consciousness.||S. Bhattacharya

It considers these changes in their three constituents: changes within the segment of SC/ST; changes in the wider caste Hindu society; and changes in the inter-relations between caste Hindu society and the SC/ST segment. The discussion of the inter-relation between the SC and caste Hindu society touches mainly upon the problem of untouchability and caste discrimination while in the case of scheduled tribes, the problem of transition from tribal isolation and backwardness to assinilation into and greater interaction with the rest of Indian society is touched upon.||A.

The Treaty has already been attacked by transnational corporate interests-which have all heavily invested in the exploitation of the oceans' resources - as introducing "dangerous concepts that could be used in future MNC contract negotiations with LDC governments". Naturally, there has been much euphoria in the less developed countries over the adoption of the Treaty. This article, while acknowledging the positive potentialities of the Treaty, also points to the existing broader structural constraints in international economic relations, the overwhelming dominance of transnational capital, and argues that the Treaty, which is ostensibly blueprinted to enhance third world sovereignty over the 'common heritage of mankind' might also legitimise and buttress corporate power whose goals stand in blatant confrontation to such sovereignty.||Frederick Clairmonte,John Cavanagh

The means of defence of their independence and power is by mercantile lobbies and political neutrality seems necessary to this strategy. Party political policies towards the agricultural mercantile sector are inconsistent and, in turn, party political support by agricultural merchants is widely spread and characterised by low levels of participation. Mercantile associations are keys to mercantile political activity. They are responses to threats to merchants by organised labour and by State interventions. They are also responses to the need for auto-regulation of trading behaviour. The present case study shows how the bureaucracy, banks, judiciary and politicians may be lobbied to modify policy in mercantile interests. Mercantile power and independence is qualified by the power of lobbies representing other interests and cases of clashes of interest between merchants, organised industry asd organised agriculture show the continuing power of merchants.||Barbara Harriss

The first, over the next two or three decades, will likely involve a 'quick' shift away from oil and gas to greater dependence on coal, tar sands, and oil shale, nuclear fission, geothermal energy and on renewable forms of energy such as hydro, solar, biomass and wind; all of which could be made available in secondary energy forms which will call for modest, manageable changes in the prevailing infrastructure system. The second phase of the transition period would cover roughly the first quarter of the next century. The sustainable energy supply would then have to be expanded to include breeder reactors, fusion, large-scale solar and other renewable forms, all of which are now identified as proven or promising in terms of technical feasibility and economic viability. Among the many constraints on the evolving energy system in the underdeveloped countries, the financing of energy production is among the more significant ones.||Liaqat Ali

The justification for this indignation rests on the tenet that in the absence of economic considerations the product chosen will be the clinically optimal one. It will be the best product for that patient. It is further argued that if price was considered as relevant then the drug prescribed would be the best value for money, given the alternatives, rather than the best value for that patient in purely clinical terms. Thus many patients would be prescribed 'second best' or even 'third best' drugs and the doctor could no longer be seen as doing his very best for those patients. If the consideration of prices results in sub-optimal treatment, it follows that doctors can improve the health of their patients more by ignoring drug prices. This model rests on a number of naive assumptions that have been firmly exploded as well as some not so naive assumptions that are worth exploring future.||Mahesh S. Patel

26/12/1981- ||special article||4370529||Against Feudalism||Historians and economists have propounded various theories of 'feudalism' and 'semi-feudalism' in order to explain social formations in India. The theory of 'Indian Feudalism' has two versions, the Universalist and the Particularist. This paper offers a critique of both these versions and argues that a theory of social formations derived from European experience has little relevance to Indian conditions. Indeed, there are no corresponding Indian equivalents in practice to many essential components of European feudalism like vassalage, serfdom, fealty, etc. In suggesting an alternative framework for Indian social history, the paper argues that some of the characteristic and unique features Hindu social organisation like Brahmanism and the caste system may offer better guidance to understand the process by which the hierarchic structure of Hindu society with some classes producing use value and some other classes appropriating the surplus out of it and distributing it among themselves has been held together over all these centuries.||Ashok Rudra

This is equally true of the work of an individual which too has to be viewed in the context of the development of the discipline and the involvement of the individual researcher in that development. This essay, which is both historical and autobiographical, attempts, by considering the author's own education, training and research as a 'case study', to present a retrospective and perspective of sociological research in India. It is in five parts. Part I describes the sociological equipment which a student of the second generation of Indian sociology, like the author, acquired. Part II delineates the author's training in the tradition of the founders and the beginnings of his professional career, and Part III describes his first efforts in independent research. Part IV deals with the new trends in British and American sociology which influenced the author between 1952 and 1956 and Part V makes some general and specific observations having a bearing on the past as well as the future of sociological research in India.

This involves focusing development programmes on the basic needs of village communities and of target groups of the poor of the area. It is common now to judge rural plans by the number of poor helped to rise above the poverty line, and not merely by growth indicators. Given this new orientation in planning, a useful contribution that social sciences can make is through helping the planner to perceive a rural area as a social system undergoing diverse processes of change. The economist has to begin by acquiring frameworks for delineating the structure and components of micro-level rural economic systems. One of the issues being investigated in the Tumkur Project is: how far looking at a rural area, using simple typologies of villages and of rural groups, helps discern characteristics and processes of rural economic systems. The purpose of this preliminery paper is to describe the typologies we are using, and the clues they give to the state of development in a backward rural area.||V. M. Rao

For proper comparisons between budget estimates and actual results, it is necessary to have regard to the gross revenue upon which the estimated expenditures in the budget were based. It is necessary to separate between expenditures unaffected by annual and other variations in traffic earnings and expenditures which are so affected. Experience of earlier years makes it possible to differentiate between invariable and variable expenditures. A method has to be perfected whereby a more accurate idea can be obtained of the actual expenses as well as of what the budget estimate would have been had the actual variation in traffic receipts been known at the time the estimate was made. In this article such a viable method is explored.||K. A. Chandrasekaran

While the proclaimed objective of the scheme was to safeguard the villages from the forces of the Mizo National Front and at the same time accelerate developmental work, the actual ways in which it functioned resulted in extensive dislocation of social and economic life. The forced movement of the people led to a concentration of agricultural workers in the grouping centres; and with the exhaustion of all available land in these centres, the already short cycle of jhum cultivation was further shortened, leading to steep falls in agricultural production and food shortages. The extensive dislocation of jhum cultivation also affected social harmony leading to steep falls in agricultural production and food shortages. The extensive dislocation of jhum cultivation also affected social harmony leading to new forms of social tension like violent crime, gambling and and alcoholism, practices relatively unknown in the region till then. The paper considers in some detail these social and economic consequences of regrouping with reference to two grouping centres, one in the jhum area and another in the wet rice cultivation area.||C.

It was meant to meet the political and administrative problems which the colonial nd, later, the imperial forces faced in the process of expansion and consolidation of their domains. With the rise of national movements in the colonies and the consequent disintegration of colonial rule, new forms of imperialist domination have come into being. It is imperative for this imperialism to subvert and co-opt the raising anti-imperialist forces in third world countries. In this endeavour too, anthropology, specifically anthropology of development as it is practised today, provides the necessary academic and intellectual support. This paper seeks to establish some of these connections between imperialism, anthropology and the problem of development in third world countries.||Jaganath Pathy

It is still not clear if these policies are intended to bring about a small peasant proprietor economy, or whether these aim at a mixed economy where the agricultural labourers and poor artisans will have communal ownership of land, with the government extending support to small producers' co operatives. Such lack of clarity of aims is perhaps due to the fact that the leading partner of the Left Front government has underestimated the degree of penetration of usury and merchant capital in rural economy and overestimated feudal exploitation; this probably also explains the importance attached in the Left Front government's agrarian programme to registration of tenancy and land distribution.||Kalyan Dutt

While the bureaucratic organisation assumes the responsibility of operation and maintenance of the system upto the government outlet, the command area under the latter along with its network of field channels and drains and control structures become the responsibility of the farmers for operation and maintenance. This is the most critical area since under or over-irrigation due to lack of maintenance of community-owned items will affect yields per hectare and generally the performance of the system. This paper discusses formal or informal farmers' organisation to deal with the problems at the terminal level of maintenance, distribution of water and resolution of disputes. The paper is in three parts. The first part delineates the functions of farmers' organisation in an irrigation project and deals with the essentials of an environment under which these organisations come into their own for efficiently discharging their functions. The second part presents two case studies, one dealing with an old project and the other with a recentone. The last part summarises the discussion and lists some policy conclusions.||T. K. Jayaraman

This paper attempts to establish the direction of resource flows between the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors that have actually taken place in India in the 1950s and the 1960s. Section I sets out the concepts used and defines the limits of the paper's focus. Section II presents estimates of such resource flows as have taken place and Section III briefly considers their implications for economic development. Its conclusions are that financial flows into agriculture by way of government expenditure were necessary to create capital-intensive development in agriculture; these, in turn, have led to a savings potential in this sector which yet needs to be tapped.||Ashoka Mody

18/4/1981- ||special articles||4369725||Agrarian Problems of India: An East and Southeast Asian Perspective||By further stepping up investment in irrigation, agricultural research and modern inputs, the agricultural growth rate in India can be raised from the present 2.5 per cent to the target of 4 per cent in the medium term. If government policies are reoriented to reduce excess intervention in the market mechanism and to assist collective actions by rural people more appropriately to promote their own initiative, agricultural growth performance will improve further. A more serious problem, however, is that of poverty and inequality. The technocratic approach to increasing labour employment and wage earnings by intensifying agricultural production based on development of irrigation systems and of land-saving and labour-using technologies might not be as effective in India in solving this problem as in Southeast Asia, because of sharp class conflicts here between cultivators and agricultural labourers. Under conditions of high labour transaction costs, the technocratic approach may induce mechanisation, thereby aggravating the situation. The reformist approach geared to redistribution of income and assets also does not seem to have much scope for success, given the social and political conditions of India. Especially, considering the fact that it is not the absentee landlords but the cultivating peasants who are now dominant in rural India, the redistribution of land to landless labourers on a significant scale appears almost impossible, except in some of the eastern states.||Yujiro Hayami

Another objective is to view human resources as an organic entity of individual and collective energy. A human being as a worker can be viewed as an energy system rather than as a role-rooted instrumentally-related work input. Such an approach is development-oriented in the context of the complex criss-cross relations which bind people-at-work. Their subjective orientations can provide insights for objective analysis.||Nitish R. De

The paper attempts to throw some light on the processes and problems of the so-called 'socialist transition period'. The emergence of an influential, new, non-feudal, middle peasant rich class (similar to that of Vietnam's discussed here) is a widespread phenomenon in post-independence Asia. Developments since the article was written indicate that the adoption of new economic and agricultural policies has caused not only widespread discussion of contemporary production problems but also, it appears, the reappraisal of the collectivisation campaigns and of policies debated and adopted in 1960-61. In this period (later denounced as 'rightist' by the party) the official view was that the socialist revolution had been completed and hence there was no need for further class struggle. Present policy appears to require yet another reappraisal of this 'rightist' historial period and others covered in our paper. That past collectivisation is being discussed anew and re-interpreted by the Party, places most of the issues dealt with in the present paper in the forefront of political-ideological-struggle in contemporary Vietnam.||Alec Gordon

29/8/1981- ||special article||4370171||Trend of Industrialisation in Bengal, 1901-1931||While the Bengal Presidency area follows the same pattern of de-industrialisation as India as a whole, when the Presidency area is disaggregated into its three constituent provinces, the provinces of Bihar and Orissa are seen to have suffered from de-industrialisation during the period studied in this paper and the Province of Bengal stands out as the newly industrialising area, notwithstanding the destruction of traditional industries. Bihar and Orissa, hinterlands in the industrial map of colonial India, followed the familiar pattern of de-industrialisation and their rate of deceleration was so high as to more than offset the industrialisation of Bengal province. When data for manufacturing working force, which is taken here as an indicator of industrialisation, are compared for different regions and for India as a whole, it is found that while the country as a whole was witnessing the destruction of the industrial working force over the decades, Bengal and Bombay were taking shape as the new industrially developed regions. These pockets did not, however, have any significant 'spread effect' for the rest of India. This paper studies the situation in Bengal Presidency as a test case. While Bengal and Bombay suffered from a cyclical downturn in industry in the late 1920s, the impact of the Depression in the industrial sector appears to have been limited to these two areas only. There was no sign of depression in the modern industrial field in Madras. Study of this phenomenon is likely to throw up new facts pertaining to India's industrial history.||Raghabendra Chattopadhyay

The common criticism about the land reforms programme in the country is that legislation has been far short of the policy declarations and the implementation has been nowhere near even that watered down legislation. The state of Bihar is considered to be the worst in this respect, both in legislation and implementation. It is proposed to present, in brief, in a series of six papers the salient features of all the legislation undertaken in this respect in Bihar since the introduction of the permanent settlement in 1793 to-date and bring out various lacunae, built into the laws, and other impediments considered to be responsible for their non-implementation. An effort will be made to trace back the evolution of the law stage by stage so that by piecing together the different stages a broad outline of the law, both historically and analytically, is obtained. To begin with, an attempt has been made in this paper (the first of the proposed six) to review the legislation regarding the transferability of raiyati holdings from 1793 to 1950. The subsequent papers will deal with the transferability of raiyati holdings in Chota Nagpur (Bihar), rents of raiyati holdings, machinery for the settlement of revenue matters, status of tenants and the record-of-rights.||D.

The paper details the many evils associated with the early years of tea industry in Assam, including the methods of recruitment of tea labour among the impoverished tribals of Chota Nagpur region who were tricked or coerced into 'voluntarily' entering tea labour force, and the general impoverishment the tea industry both caused and exploited in its relentless pursuit of profits. But even within the limits let by the purely profit-seeking motive of the planters, the so-called 'enclaved industrialisation' represented by the growth of tea industry in Assam did not in any way contribute to the growth of total productive forces; on the contrary, from the point of organisation of labour force and labour process, both the agricultural and plantation sectors in Assam remained backward.||Suranjan Chatterjee,Ratan Das Gupta

12/9/1981- ||special articles||4370220||Non-Development of Bihar: A Case of Retarded Sub-Nationalism||It is argued in this paper that the absence of sub-nationalism has acted as a stumbling block in the economic development of Bihar. No movement to preserve the regional market as an exclusive preserve of the nascent Bihari bourgeoisie too off and outside business and industrial interests have got entrenched in the state's economy. Neither traditional traders and artisans nor the agricultural classes could develop as industrial entrepreneurs in Bihar. This failure of Bihari capitalists to develop the forces of production has also been responsible for the lack of sub-national economic awakening in Bihar. Apart from the stagnating influence of colonial rule, Bihar has to reckon also with the Permanent Settlement, which in Bihar "possessed its worst elements and contained none of its redeeming features". The feudal Bihari leadership closely allied with outside capital was opposed to any radical tenancy reform and was indifferent to indigenous industrial development. The absence of a sub-national consciousness even after independence has been the by-product of Bihar's backwardness, its 'semi-feudal' production relations. Even now no class is able to break new ground. A multi-class endeavour is thus required to lift the constraints on Bihar's stunted sub-nationalism and, its corollary, retarded economic and industrial growth.||Shaibal Gupta

Six additional nuclear reactors, each with a capacity of 235 megawatts, are expected to be set up during the Sixth Plan. These programmes are defended on the ground that nuclear power is indispensable for meeting the growth in demand for power in the country and that it is technically more efficient and economically cheaper than power generated from coal-based plants. This paper subjects these claims to a critical scrutiny and brings out some of the major issues relating to nuclear technology which have wider implications for the economy.||Deb Kumar Bose

The paper questions some of the commonly held assumptions regarding the root causes of the undisputable backwardness of the community and suggests that this has been due to the lack of a continuing formation of lower and middle class segments employed in the professions. The reason for this not having, taken place in post-independence India are, one, the historical fact of partition which created an acute identity crisis for the Muslims who stayed on in India; and two, the deliberate neglect of and discrimination against the Muslims by the larger Hindu community which, while professing to be secular, has been in practice discriminating against Muslims in the matter of education and jobs.||A.

This study presents information relevant to an understanding of their conditions of life, as these occur among those settled in colonies in and around Madurai. Where possible, comparisons are drawn between repatriates and resident groups of people, repatriates from Sri Lanka and repatriates from Burma and repatriates employed in industries and repatriates otherwise employed. While the data show that the conditions of life of the repatriates around Madurai are not nearly as bad as they have often been pictured in the press, government and other agencies could be doing far more than they are in the effective implementation of the entire repatriate process. It seems clear that the less fortunate have left the housing colonies while the more fortunate remain.||Cole P. Dodge,Paul D. Wiebe

It was at best an act in crisis management. It was forced on the government by an industrial collapse resulting largely from government policies themselves. Post-nationalisation industrial development can hardly be said to have justified the social aims of nationalisation. Besides, nationalisation does not amount to socialism. The measure has served merely to strengthen the interests of state capitalism as such. It is difficult as yet to state, evidentially, whether it has had the effect of serving the interests of the ruling classes in the country. [This paper is published in two parts. The first part below reviews the performance of the coal industry in the two decades prior to nationalisation. The second part, to appear next week, will examine the validity of the official arguments for takeover, and will describe and analyse the real causes which led to the nationalisation of coal.]||Rajiv Kumar

They are stratified in terms of control over resources. Furthermore, during the process of industrialisation, major alterations in the pattern of stratification are inescapable. Old resources acquire a new significance, and new resources are to be managed and controlled effectively to survive in the severe competition over the control over resources. In this, tribes cannot remain isolated any longer and changing stratification is consequently appropriate for the study of tribes.||Pradip Kumar Bose

Only as long as the mystification that women are 'non-workers' is maintained is it possible to keep them unorganised and atomised, and pay them very low wages. Further, the definition of all women as housewives and all men as breadwinners has the effect of obscuring these women's productive work as work for capital accumulation. This paper examines these formulations in the light of the conditions of life and work of women lace workers of Narsapur, West Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh. While the exploitation of the subsistence production of the lace workers of Narsapur has enabled some men of the area to become capitalist 'manufacturers' engaged in export trade, this integration of the labour of these women into a world system of capital accumulation has not and will not transform them into free wage labourers. For, it is precisely the fact of their not being free wage labourers, but housewives (and hence, by definition, considered 'non-working'), which makes capital accumulation possible in this sector.||Maria Mies

Given that present interest rates are substantially higher than assumed by the Government of India and given that we do not possess any leverage to make the alumina price reflect the cost of money or the cost of production, the project seems viable only on the most optimistic assumptions about alumina prices and money and production costs. Other issues which need to be considered include the size of the alumina refinery where the global optimality of our French consultant has prevailed over the project's optimum; the very free import of plant and equipment the project demands, which can mean under-utilisation of capacity for domestic plant suppliers; the likelihood of a false picture of competitiveness of alumina export arising from possible subsidy by related public sector investments; the expensive decision on provision of captive thermal sets, given that power is virtually a raw material in the production of aluminium; and, finally, question of pollution from the mining operations and the siting of the refinery.||Kannan Srinivasan,Vinod Vyasulu,S.

The difficulty is that there have been hardly any attempts to put the data in a readily comparable, systematic, statistical series. This paper studies annual imports of India over the period 1960-61 to 1974-75. The purpose is to analyse the pattern of imports with a view to presenting a detailed picture of the changes that have occurred over these 15 years. A first view of changes in the pattern of imports is provided by a comparison of the direction and rate of change of different categories and the total import bill. It aims at a two-fold treatment which may be summarised as follows: (1) To construct, as far as it is possible, a time series of India's imports on merchandise account for the period. (2) To re-classify imports into major economic categories. Part I contains a discussion of the salient features of foreign trade statistics of India. Part II deals with the method and problems arising in construction of time series data of imports. Part III presents the results and offers concluding remarks.||Vidya Pitre

It argues that the apparent failure of technology and management in accomplishing the developmental objectives in several third world countries has to be traced to an inadequate appreciation of the historical context in which these techniques emerged and have been deployed successfully. It suggests that the intervention of advanced techniques of management may have actually contributed, even if inadvertently, to further intensification of the state of underdevelopment in many underdeveloped countries. What is necessary is a recognition that the developmental objectives of highly advanced societies like that of the United States and of underdeveloped countries like India are significantly different; and only by a critical re-ordering of the institution of management can modern technology and management be harnessed towards these different objectives.||V.

11/4/1981- ||special articles||4369701||Premchand: A Historiographic View||The work of Premchand is marked by a profound paradox. The clarity of his perception of the wretched lot of the Indian poor, specifically the kisans, contrasts with the lack of clarity in his prescription of the remedy for these iniquities. The portrayal of the conditions of the poor and the vague prescriptions for their amelioration in his early work are succeeded in his later writings by a realisation that to portray these conditions is itself to prescribe a remedy. Having, as a creative writer, portrayed reality, Premchand as the nationalist political commentator close to the Congress, though never of it, felt (especially in his journalistic writings) that he had to take into account, in suggesting remedies, the possible and the pragmatic which may not always be the just. The revolutionary implications of his creative writings are thus tempered by an unwillingness to accept the upheaval and violence that any attempt to change the system would necessarily entail. This paper traces some of these contradictory pulls in Premchand's writings and suggests possible explanations for them.||Sudhir Chandra

The paper draws a correlation between the expressions 'normative planning' and 'functional planning' used by Friedman and economic planners, on the hand, and 'strategic planning styles' and 'operational planning styles' used in managerial literature, on the other. The problem of risk is perceived differently by Socialist planners from Western corporate planners. This was revealed in the discussions at the Moscow meet of the International-Economic Conference in 1974, the first and perhaps the only occasion when professional planners from socialist and Western countries met to understand each other's methods. The paper hypothesises that mainly as a consequence of the actual and perceived impact of 'risk', there is a similarity in the 'styles' of corporate planning between public sector in India and socialist planners. The paper analyses the assets employed in public and private sectors in India into varying ranges of importance of 'strategic planning' and concludes that the dominating style in public sector in India should be the operational one. The paper notes that lack of political will renders ineffective even a well-conceived information and implementation system in support of operational plans.||R. C. Sekhar

It shows that the market is not only far from competitive. It is also relatively even less competitive from the point of view of the poor producers than from the point of view of the richer ones.||Suman Sarkar

Specifically, it discusses Operation Barga, the programme of distribution of vested land, the measures taken to provide alternative sources of credit in the rural areas and the various employment generation schemes. The paper finds on balance, that the Left Front government has in the last four years of its rule tried its best to come up to the expectations it had raised. While the economic benefits the poor of West Bengal have gained in these four years is notable, the political gains they have made, and which they can use to make further advances, is substantial.||Ratan Ghosh

It shows that even though both sides to the dispute are able to marshal voluminous legal evidence in support of their claims, making the issue appear as one of extreme complexity, this complexity is entirely fictitious and specious and is intended to conceal the almost elemental simplicity of the issues involved. Given the impossibility of an armed resolution of the conflict, the boundary dispute can only be resolved politically. But a resolution of the deadlock is at present even more unlikely because of the differing, even contradictory, international perceptions of the two countries.||Neville Maxwell

The problem presents itself in its most magnified form during drought years. During such occasions, which are quite frequent, farming fails to ensure even the minimum subsistence requirement of humans and livestock. Through experience of generations, farmers have evolved several adjustment devices to manage their survival during the drought years. However, farmers' adjustment mechanisms against risk have a number of well-recognised weakness. [Jodha 1975, Sen 1976]. This paper examines the possibilities of strengthening farmers' adjustment mechanisms, particularly through credit. This calls for proper understanding of the adjustment mechanism itself and the prevailing role of credit therein.||N. S. Jodha

25/7/1981- ||special articles||4370044||On Measurement of Poverty||In this paper, the author deals with the criticism levelled by V K R V Rao and P V Sukhatme against the estimate of poverty which he, along with Nilakanth Rath, had presented in "Poverty in India" (EPW, January 1971). The author argues that V K R V Rao's criticism is based on a confusion between two related but separate phenomena, namely, poverty and under-nutrition; and that Rao gets the 'paradoxical' result because he uses the terms 'poor' and 'not-poor' in two different senses without seeing the difference. The same confusion between poverty and under-nutrition, according to the author, underlines P V Sukhatme's criticism. Besides, it is characterised by improper and incorrect use of statistical methods; in particular, the author argues, Sukhatme's assessment that the 'correct' estimate of poverty is only about one-half the estimate given by Dandekar and Rath is founded on a statistical-methodological error.||V.

23/5/1981- ||special articles||4369861||IMF Bearer Bonds: Do They Portend Much?||An interesting aspect of the borrowing arrangement the International Monetary Fund has just concluded with Saudi Arabia is that the Saudi authorities can ask for the issue by the Fund of its bearer notes against the sums lent to it by that country. It is the purpose of this paper to examine what this commitment by the Fund to issue bearer notes portends. In Part I is described the borrowing arrangements to give the necessary background to the above mentioned commitment. In Part II are analysed the various options open to Saudi Arabia in addition to the option to ask for bearer notes. In Part III is exmined the likelihood, in our judgment, of resort to the bearer note option, to be followed in Part IV by examination of the wider implications of recourse to this type of borrowing by the Fund. This matter is important in view of the possible expectations that the frequent talk by the Fund Management of a major recycling role by the Fund might have created amongst many of its member countries, especially the non-oil exporting developing countries which currently face an enormous spurt in their payments deficits.||I.

The paper is divided into six parts. Part I examines the problem of fragmentation of the labour market structure and certain related aspects. Part II describes the labour market, the different categories of intermediaries employed for securing, retaining and supervising labour. The situation in the three industries are described in some detail to show the essentially 'un-free' nature of this labour which is tied by various traditional and nontraditional forms of bondage even when it is apparently employed in a 'free' market. Part III discusses the labour market policy pursued by the employers and Part IV considers some of the major factors determining the nature of the labour market structure operating at the 'supply' and the 'demand' end. Part V seeks to make a comparison of some of the features of the labour market structure in colonial India with those prevailing during the period of early industrialisation in the West, particularly Britain and Russia. The broader implications of the sort of labour market structure created in India are briefly touched upon in the concluding part.||Ranajit Das Gupta

1/3/1981- ||perspectives on industrial growth||4369610||Factors Underlying the Slow Growth of Indian Industry||In the author's view, the strongest political force in the country, even more powerful than the kulak and the bourgeoisie is the petty-bourgeois haute-proletarian with a little education and less property. It was this class that inherited power from the British. It is members of this class who flock the unemployment markets and who have required the proliferation of the public enterprises and the small enterprises. The high capital-output ratios are one of the results of the petty-proles trying to squeeze, in ever-increasing numbers, into an industrial base that is not growing fast enough. There is hence a situation which is incapable of expansion, as the petty-proles have a minimum-work ethic and absorb all the meagre surpluses through wanting and exacting jobs. They are the ones who form the main youth axis of any agitation in the country. When finally the system grinds to a halt where government investment can just maintain the industrial base but cannot expand industrial employment, the petty-prole class will rise in revolt against a system that employs them but fails to exploit them. This paper argues against the presently fashionable theses about the political-economic crisis in the system with reference to facts and figures commonly quoted.||Ashok V. Desai

It is a case-study of how the World Bank forges development policies that subvert any real autonomous development by enlarging the bounty for the Bank's corporate allies, the TNCs, while helping prop up authoritarian regimes like Marcos'. The author traces the shifting of domestic class alignments in relative and absolute terms as a direct consequence of these World Bank-conceived policies. The business community linked to international capital is rewarded, while domestically-oriented businessmen watch their numbers erode. At the bottom of all this stand the Filipino peasants who struggle on in poverty as the World Bank wreaks havoc in diverting the economy in an export-oriented direction.||Robin Broad

It is still open for consideration whether one should or should not process the entire Census data through the computer because this has implications of cost, utilisation of equipment after the peak period of processing is over, whether the data themselves are capable of such sophisticated tabulation and the possibility of over-editing. The 1981 experience would be most useful in providing a feedback on these basic issues.||P. Padmanabha

21/11/1981- ||special articles||4370404||Coastal Shipping: Destination Unknown?||This paper attempts to delineate the factors responsible for the adverse trend in coastal shipping and to suggest measures to reverse this trend. In the wake of the energy crisis, the need for rescuing the coastal shipping industry becomes almost imperative, since water transport is relatively more energy-efficient than other modes of transport like railways and roads. A proper appraisal of the role of coastal shipping has been hampered by an imperfect understanding about the cost aspects of this industry. The shipping industry, the port authorities, and the government are perennially engaged in a triangular debate, with cost figures hurled about. The cost figures are propounded by each agency in such a way that any objective onlooker cannot fail to detect a trace of vested interest in every figure supplied. This paper attempts to present a methodology deriving the costs of coastal shipping in a reasonably systematic way. Two estimates of costs have been supplied: (i) financial costs, or the costs actually incurred by the coastal ship operator and (ii) resource costs, or the costs reflecting the true value of the national resources used up in the coastal shipping industry.||D.
