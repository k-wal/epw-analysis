The task of environment analysis for corporate planning becomes difficult because of the frequent changes in government policies. Yet it is necessary to formulate an operational framework for environmental analysis for a systematised attempt at strategic planning. We have presented in this paper a list of selected economic and regulatory conditions which have been empirically found to have a significant impact on the business operations of a large and diversified industrial enterprise.||Charan D.
