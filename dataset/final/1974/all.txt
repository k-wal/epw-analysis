After a prolonged period of hostility and tension, the hatchet of the Second World War has been at last buried. The flag of the Chase Manhattan Bank has been hoisted at 1 Karl Marx Avenue, Moscow and its penumbra is about to reach Peking. The days of hot and cold wars nearly over, the third world continues to be a theatre of increasingly intense economic rivalry among various shades of imperialism. The period has produced a sort of economic theory for its own defence and legitimisation. The new 'vulgar economy' has mounted a fresh attack on Marx. This paper analyses some of the elements of neoclassical theory that were intended to refute the basic tenets of Marxian economics. Next, it takes up the current, neo-Ricardian and neo-Keynesian, critique of the neoclassical school. Finally, it reviews the recent attempts - particularly by Morishima, and Samuelson-Weizsacker who are the members of the so-called 'neo-neoclassical' family - to 'modify' Marx's economics "in the light of the present-day advanced level of economic theory".||Ranjit Sau

29/6/1974- ||review of agriculture, june 1974||4363779||Notes of a Rural Area Development Tourist||A number of lines of public debate and analytical interest in India-involving, among other things, agricultural activities in the countryside, schemes for 'integrated' development, ideas for more direct attacks on mass poverty and unemployment, efforts to identify and promote rural growth centres, and moves toward multi-level (state and district) planning-all seem more or less to be intersecting in a zone of policy concern called 'rural area development'. In July 1973 the author spent between three and four weeks-mostly in Ahmedabad, Anand, Pantnagar, Bombay, Bangalore, Madras and Trivandrum-trying to gather some fresh notions of what is going on in the rural area development field. Necessarily, such tourist impressions are hastily and selectively based and it is left to the reader to supply a more integrated organisation of these notes. The points made by the author fit most readily under the following sequence of headings: (1) the definition of 'regions' and 'areas' for nalytical and policy-administrative purposes; (2) politico-administrative decentralisation of decision-making; (3) delegating sideways; (4) decentralisation and equity; (5) decentralisation and finance; (6) decentralised planning-the theory and practices emerging at state and district levels; (7) settlements policy; and, (8) articulating the network-operationally and in terms of research infrastructure.||John P.

26/1/1974- ||special articles||4363380||India and the Market of South and Southeast Asia||There are several forces at work as a result of which the market for industrial goods in India tends to remain inelastic. The pattern of distribution of income and wealth, and the nature of technology imported from abroad are two of the major factors which are responsible for this inelasticity. In any case, so long as output restriction at home is a profitable proposition, who would care for export promotion! The foreign demand for India's traditional exports is lately picking up, but the buoyancy of these agro-based or agro-related commodities is not likely to offer a long-term solution for India's exports. Among the non-traditional exports the potential strength of India lies precisely in those goods which embody the technology that is suited to Asian conditions. In its own course Indian industry perhaps would not orient itself in the direction of developing the new technology. A suitable institutional framework has, therefore, to be provided to achieve this objective. The author here puts forward the broad contours of such a proposal.||Ranjit Sau

Are 'capitalist' farms cultivated in the main by hired labourers less efficient than family farms working with the help of family labour? Does cropsharing depress productivity? These are the questions which we hope to answer in a specific historic context characterised by technological backwardness and massive unemployment, as one finds in West Bengal and most other parts of India. Economists concerned with agriculture have debated these issues for at least two centuries. Among the marginalists there has been a spate of discussion in recent years triggered off by Georgescu-Roegan. In the first part of this essay from section 1 to section 5, we shall examine these writings from a theoretical standpoint but within the above-mentioned context. The second part of the article, section 6 to 8, is devoted to an empirical verification and a critique of the marginalist theories. Our hypotheses regarding the issues in debate are also speeled out, based on our findings. Although Marxists employ an entirely different analytical framework some of the questions asked are no different from those in bourgeois economics. Hence at the beginning of the final part a brief sketch of established Marxist ideas on the subject is given. It is followed by a rapid scrutiny of historical evidence available for West Bengal or for India as a whole. In the final section we seek to explain the apparent inconsistencies between the established Marxist ideas and the historical trends. These inconsistencies are traced to the existence of semi-feudalism, the basic features of which are also analysed.||Nirmal K. Chandra

Utilisation of renewable resources - solar radiation and subsequent forms - is the only long-term solution. The advanced countries have certain disadvantages for a change-over to the renewable energy sources - unfavourable geographical positions and an industrial structure geared to highly concentrated energy consumption pockets. India is not burdened with the same energy tradition. Therefore disposition of technical manpower and material resources to large-scale utilisation of replenishable energy resources should be the long-term objective, which would provide the necessary energy and employment distribution, helping also to eliminate some of the ills of urbanisation.||B.

This has been done in terms of the Planning Commission's own pronouncements on the subject. It is found that the basic statement of the social objective is a non-statement. The discussion of the "policy-frame" exhibits a penchant for abstract logic without being operational. The programmes for the removal of poverty are likewise vague in terms of their quantitative effects on the attainment of the objective. The discussion of the changes in the institutional framework is couched in non-operational terms such as "attitude transformation" and "structural reformation". The credibility of the Planning Commission even in terms of its own statements appears to be poor indeed with reference to the avowedly most basic objective of the Plan. When we add to this the inability of the government to curb deficit financing and the price rise during 1973-74, the poor procurement performance with the best-ever harvest and the concessions granted to various interests on the eve of state elections, the possibilities of the government taking tough policy decisions for redistributive purposes appear at best remote.||Suresh D.

28/12/1974- ||special article||4364291||National Accounts and the Regression Enthusiast: Sri Lanka: A Study||National accounts of countries are used to assess current developments and to view these developments in the perspective of the past. Small changes are dutifully reported and various sorts of ratios are compiled. These changes and ratios are then compared to the values of similar changes and ratios in the past in the particular country and to the corresponding values for other countries. In using national accounts for time-series models and in pooling them for cross-country regressions one should be aware of the ways in which the accounts are put together and of the many puzzles then contain. This note provides a very brief account of the procedures by which different components of the series are put together in Sri Lanka and of a few problems associated with them. Neither the approximations nor the puzzles are, however, peculiar to Sri Lanka. The discussion suggests a number of morals for users of national accounts. (a) One should be extremely wary of reading much into small changes in items like Gross Domestic Product, Gross Domestic Investment and Gross Domestic Savings - aggregates which have become the subjects of close scrutiny in the current wave of macro regression models. (b) In studying changes, rate of growth, etc, one should study changes of the commodity sector separately from changes in the service sectors. (c) The constant price series of national account for countries such as Sri Lanka obscure almost as much as they reveal - partly because of the doubtful relevance of many of the deflators used and partly because of the wide fluctuations in export prices. Analysis of changes in GDP at constant prices needs to be supplemented by estimates, however crude, of changes in net commodity availabilities. (d) Finally, the optimism of the time-series enthusiast should be somewhat dampened by the fact that, in Sri Lanka's case, even in the final accounts, one-third of GDP (not counting tea and rubber) is estimated indirectly and about one-seventh is simply assumed to grow at a trend rate. Unless he is careful, the time-series enthusiast may well find himself regressing one variable on another variable from which it was estimated in the first place!||Arun Shourie

The author is concerned with the extent to which the Scheduled Castes have left behind their traditional occupation, whether it be scavenging, leather work or agricultural labour, their entry into salaried occupations, particularly government service, and their exploitation of educational opportunities. It emerges from the discussion that the policy of preferential treatment to Scheduled Castes which has been in practice for over two decades, discounting the pre-Independence period, has barely scraped the surface of the problem. The Scheduled Castes continue overwhelmingly in their traditional occupations in rural areas. Even in the urban areas only a fraction of the posts in the administration which are reserved for them is actually filled. Similarly, they are still steeped in illiteracy and only a small proportion of the population of school-going age actually attends school. Completion of formal education even upto the secondary level is negligible.||Uma Ramaswamy

In fact, their fertility is so low that despite high life expectancy, the number of Parsis has been declining for more than two decades now. This paper examines the trend in fertility and mortality levels of Parsis. It seeks to examine the transition from high levels in fertility and mortality to low levels and the factors which have brought about this transition. The size and the sex-age composition of the Parsi population are also discussed to facilitate an understanding of their fertility and mortality levels. The article is published in three parts. The first part discusses the size of the Parsi population and the change in the age-sex composition. The level and trends in mortality will be examined in the second part and the trends in fertility in the third.||Leela Visaria

The fall in prices has been mostly due to the nearness of the harvest causing a precipitous fall in prices because of excessive stocking out of line with what the market can bear. The wage freeze and the cuts in expenditure have also forced a lot of poor people out of the market and thus led to a slackening of demand. Thus there is a grim reality behind the reduction in prices.||S. K. Rao

The companies are divided, first, into major industry groups and, then, into major products groups. These companies together account for between 30 and 75 per cent of the output of the major industry groups. The growth of output in the listed companies has been more rapid than that in the relative industry group. Industry groups which did not achieve the average growth are mainly companies engaged in the basic consumer goods producing industries which have been long-established. The further analysis of correlation of the growth in output with the increase in fixed assets shows that in several product groups the increase in fixed assets did not result in a matching increase in output.||Madan Gopal Jajoo

02/3/1974- ||special articles||4363449||On 'Welfarism' vs 'Radicalism' in Planning||In a polity like ours, the planner cannot be a mere technical adviser. He is an integral part of the political process. In his capacity as a planner, he has two basic options. One is the easy way out of essentially playing the game as the politicians want him to and of providing them the opportunity to wrap their designs with the respectability of his technical expertise. The other option is ultimately that of exposure. The planner can translate the radical slogans of the political leadership into concrete programmes, sharply differentiate them from assorted gimmicks (like nationalisation), leave little scope for endogenous failures to be blamed on weather gods, Arab sheikhs or CIA agents, and in general spell out the hard choices and unpleasant policy implications in clear concrete details easily recognisable by the public, so that the next time around it is slightly more difficult for the leaders to get away with the slogans, or to unanimously approve of the Plan in the party or in cabinet meetings and then merrily go about flouting its priorities when it comes to action on detailed programmes. Such a planner's tenure may be necessarily brief, but he should utilise this time towards building pressure groups for the constituency of the unorganised poor. Effective redistribution cannot come from voluntary abdication by the top, it has to be bargained for, and, if necessary, grabbed by the bottom. There is no substitute for the countervailing power of massive organisation of the poor. On the long and arduous road towards that goal, the planner's may only be a didactic role, raising the level of public education and consciousness and improving the ability of the poor to see through the empty slogans dished out by the rich.||Pranab K.

The growth rate achieved is estimated to be around 3.9 per cent. The low growth rate has been attributed to severe operating constraints such as shortage of power, transport bottlenecks, shortage of basic raw materials, labour troubles, etc. The slow growth in capacity build-up in certain industries has also affected industrial production. The low level of industrial output, in turn, has been one of the important factors contributing to the unprecedented price rise in the economy. The present paper aims to examine the factors responsible for the shortfall in industrial production.||H. K. N. Mishra

One concerns the Hirukud project, which irrigates 282,000 acres in the Sambalpur district of Orissa; the other is in the Raipur district, just west of Sambalpur in Madhya Pradesh. Both projects attempt to improve water use and management of existing irrigation, by installing field channels to give farmers better control over the water in each field. The two projects represent the two ends of the cost spectrum. The Raipur project is capital intensive and costly relative to the Sambalpur project which consists of a simple system of village field channels installed at minimum cost. This article reports on the internal rates of return from these projects and highlights the importance of technically trained people and alternative project designs in making projects viable.||K.

31/8/1974- ||special articles||4363942||Problems in Analysing Rural Class Structure||It is important to understand in detail the socio-economic class structure in rural areas because there is still no satisfactory theory which can explain why various types of peasant associations have developed in certain places and not in others. This paper examines certain aspects of the rural class structure in the Chingleput district of Tamil Nadu. In the process, light is thrown on factors which blur class boundaries. This facilitates understanding of some of the reasons for the lack of sustained peasant organisation in Chingleput district as compared to other areas such as, for example, Tanjore. Such information is also important for the light it sheds on the sources of internal pressure to implement government policies. Most of the talk of land reform during the past 25 years has been viewed as mere rhetoric by most villagers. Here and there we have got protests. But why here and not there? It is important to know what internal forces exist that may propel people to exert pressure for implementation of official policies.||Joan P. Mencher

If this analysis correctly portrays the recent trends in the fertility rate in Kerala, and if these trends continue, it would have far-reaching implications for the population policy of underdeveloped areas like Kerala with low levels of per capita income, industrialisation and urbanisation, but high levels of literacy and education. The analysis is divided into two parts. In the first part, the author attempts to show, on the basis of available evidence from Census and Sample Registration results, that the crude birth rate in Kerala had declined by 1971 to the lowest level among all the states in India and that the rate had been declining continuously in the latter years of the sixties. In the second part, it is hypothesised that the fall in the birth rate started in the early sixties; that is, ahead of the intensification of the family planning programmes, indicating that some kind of broad societal adjustment had taken place prior to the favourable, broad-based response to family planning measure observed more recently in the state. The fall in the birth rate in the early sixties could have been the consequence of the decline in infant and child mortality rates during the latter fifties, following the extension of primary health centres and other public health measures over a period of time. It is also seen, on the basis of available data and 'guesstimates' with respect to the pattern of changes that might have taken place in birth, death and infant mortality rates during the period from 1951 onwards, that such demographic evidence as there is for this period is not inconsistent with the trends actually observed in enrolment to the first year of primary schooling.||P.

There is nothing desirable or undesirable about the present age at marriage per se. What is a cause for concern, however, is the fact that the average age at marriage of women in India has been so unresponsive to efforts to raise it. Why is this so?||Kumudini Dandekar

13/4/1974- ||special articles||4363577||Optimal Targets for the Family Planning Programme||Benefits and costs associated with family planning programmes of underdeveloped countries in general, and of India in particular, have been a subject of intensive investigations. These studies have been primarily used as a means for the justification of family planning programmes. In this paper, we have applied benefit-cost analysis to derive the economically justifiable targets for Indian family planning programmes. The targets are defined in terms of desired declines in general fertility rates (GFR). A demographic and economic model similar to Coale-Hoover is constructed to evaluate the economic consequences of different GFR paths. The cost-equations based upon the past data are used to estimate the costs of achieving various GFR paths. Benefit-cost analysis is used to compare these paths and derive optimal targets. The study shows that the benefit-cost analysis results are very sensitive to the type of economic benefits considered. Interest rates and horizon periods also effect the optimal targets. The analysis is then used to discuss the interactions among per capita consumption distribution, measures used and suggested to achieve declining fertility rates and financing of family planning programmes. It is stressed that a massive programme to reauce fertility rates may not achieve credibility unless steps are taken to achieve a greater equality in per capita consumption distribution.||S. K.

To explain this development, it is necessary to understand the monopoly houses' behaviour with respect to fixed capital investment. For this purpose, the investment decision itself has to be identified. The investment decision is not a simple decision. It has a structure. The identification of this structure has important implications. This paper is an attempt to understand some of these aspects. In Section I of the paper, published this week, a detailed attempt is made to identify the structure of Indian monopoly houses' investment decisions, conceptually as well as empirically. In Section II, certain underlying attributes of the structure will be sought to be highlighted in terms of the economics of preemption. The concluding part will seek to derive some of the more important implications of the structure of investment decisions, particularly for understanding the time-path of the monopoly houses' fixed investment.||Aurobindo Ghose

Their fertility and mortality levels have steadily declined over the past century. In fact, their fertility is so low that despite high life expectancy, the number of Parsis has been declining for more than two decades now. This paper examines the trends in fertility and mortality levels of the Parsis. It examines the transition from high levels of fertility and mortality to low levels and the factors which have brought about this transition. The size and the sex-age composition of the Parsi population are also discussed to facilitate an understanding of the fertility and mortality levels. The article is published in three parts. The first and second parts discussed the size of the Parsi population, changes in the sex-age composition and the level and trends in mortality. This, the third and concluding, part deals with trends in fertility.||Leela Visaria

The decision-makers made a fundamental mistake in taking a very narrow view of the problem of rapidly rising population growth in India and in not realising adequately that, for controlling population growth, a family planning programme forms merely one segment of a much wider spectrum of programmes. Their alienation from the masses, their Westernised values, their lack of competence in technical matters, their abject dependence on foreign consultants for assistance, and their reluctance to come to grips with urgent social problems, along with pressure from certain powerful vested interests, both within the country and abroad, all combined to impel them to conceive of a family planning programme as the instrument for bringing down the birth rate.||D.

Particular attention is paid to the Intensive Agriculture Districts Programme as an example of the package approach to extension. The major conclusions that emerge are: (1) Total factor productivity gains in agriculture in some parts of India have been truly extraordinary. (2) Regional disparities have become greater over the period under review and these may well have been partly caused by governmental allocational decisions. (3) The gains realised have not been associated exclusively with the 'Green Revolution' both in space as well as time, or with the extent of irrigated acreage. (4) The major determinant of productivity change in Indian agriculture has been the Indian Agricultural Research System and the investment in the research system has yielded social rates of return far in excess of those realised in other developmental activities. (5) Extension programmes are successful where significant economic slack exists: they do not discover new technology but can merely make production more efficient. Their marginal contribution in areas of high productivity is therefore low.||Rakesh Mohan

The author reports here on the tensions prevailing in Ahmedabad city which caused the violent incidents of July 1973. He tries to reconstruct the sequence of events before and during the riots with a view to examining how and why riots take different shapes at different times. This study tends to confirm that the riots in Ahmedabad were neither sudden nor spontaneous. Nor were they the result of instigation by a few leaders or political parties. The riots were the outcome of the accumulation of various tensions over time. Initially the spark may have been economic and political grievances, but as the riots spread, they took a communal colour. At certain places, hooligans looted shops of both Hindus and Muslims. The report would thus seem to suggest that the casual sequence in collective violence is not so much determined by the 'first cause' as by certain interposing factors.||Ghanshyam Shah

The report warns that "the country should be prepared for conditions of drought over large areas once in 4-5 years". Has this prediction any scientific basis whatsoever?

19/10/1974- ||special articles||4364096||Criteria of a Rational Wage Policy||There has been a lot of debate in recent years concerning the appropriateness of the marginal productivity theory as an explanation of the wages of labour and of wage differentials. The debate has centred on the wage-profit relationship. It is now generally agreed that the theory involves circular reasoning; that the technical condition of production being what it is, one does not know what the marginal productivity of labour is unless one knows what the rate of profit is. And it is not capital alone that is involved; we have to deal with heterogeneous sorts of labour, and this makes the problem more complicated. Further, there are enterprises whose products are not saleable; in these cases, it looks as if it is more appropriate to say that marginal productivity is derived from the price of labour than that the price of labour is derived from its marginal productivity! These logical difficulties apart, the concept of scarcity makes little sense when there is widespread unemployment of labour. In a situation like this, the concept which is relevant is just that of a minimum supply price. And so we find ourselves back to the classical world, to "cost of reproduction" and all that. Much of what goes on in the name of scarcity in our economy is indeed the creation of social institutions. Salaries at higher levels contain elements which are a surplus and "do not enter into price". Their persistence can be explained only in terms of organised oligopolistic class interests. To invoke a theory of productivity as sanction for these high salaries is not only not warranted, it is wicked.||A. K. Das Gupta

The Halpatis are not really adivasis; on the other hand, they are not considered to be full-fledged Hindus by the caste Hindu population. The 'hali' system disintegrated in the last few decades before Independence. Increasing market production put an end to the traditional arrangements that were based on widely varying mutual obligations of an economic, political, cultural and social nature. The relations between 'dhaniamo', the landlord, and 'hali', the labourer, gradually became contractual and impersonal. This paper deals with the political consequences of the change in the relationship between landlords and the Halpatis. The eclipse of the vertical ties that formed an integral part of 'halipratha' facilitated the reinforcement of horizontal solidarity. Since the thirties, voluntary social workers have been devoting themselves to the improvement of the Halpatis' social position, working from the Swaraj ashram in Bardoli and later from similar social action centres in Surat and Bulsar districts. Since 1961 social work among the Halpatis has been given an organisational basis in the Halpati Seva Sangh (HSS). However, the Halpatis have little reason to regard the HSS as an organisation that fights for their interests. For them it is an obscure body, affiliated with the government and representing external interests. The HSS cannot be called an emancipation movement at all; rather, its aims and methods prevent mobilisation of the Halpatis. What possibilities of organised social action other than the HSS are here? To be sure, dissatisfaction among the Halpatis is growing. But it still expresses itself in disconnected incidents, particularly in strikes that flare up suddenly but remain limited to single villages and soon fall flat when landlords engage labourers from elsewhere. The situation is ripe for an explosion; in fact it has been ripe for a long time. Yet none has taken place till now. Organisation of the latent unrest has been the lacking factor.||Jan Breman

It is usually made with reference to either some minimum nutritional norms for food consumption or some general 'poverty line' defined in terms of a bare minimum level of private consumer expenditure. Seldom is the discussion related to the crucial question of disparities in the vital rates in India - particularly in the rates of mortality and morbidity. Reliable information, on the disparities in these vital rates as between the various socio-economic groups or on their link with the specific health and nutrition status of these groups, is very scanty. The limited aim of this paper is to draw attention to some of these disparities - particularly to their regional variations.||Pranab K. Bardhan

The contrast between the enthusiasm with which social scientists attempt to shape and influence policy in the developing countries and the lack of any basic criticism of the values underlying the western policies which the social scientists do so much to promote and service is striking. Such an orientation is unabashed sophistry. From neglect of the basic questions of value and from attempting to understand without profound sympathy and prolonged contact, there arises amazing superficiality dressed up in jargon, linked in an unholy alliance with lack of political scruple. Only with a renewed socratic emphasis on the underlying questions of value and a new sensitivity to the political and cultural constraints and limitations on their work, together with a rediscovery of the significance of sympathy as a condition for knowledge of the other, can western social scientists really contribute to the making of a more human world.||Duncan B.

28/9/1974- ||review of agriculture, september 1974||4364024||Agrarian Structure and Rural Development||India's experience since Independence shows that there is a close inter-relation between agrarian structure and rural development. An outmoded agrarian structure is a serious obstacle to the modernisation of agriculture and rapid rural development. Such a structure is to be squarely blamed for the unequal distribution of the fruits of development leading to widening of the disparities in income and wealth. The upper classes who have cornered the bulk of the new prosperity have also succeeded in consolidating their political power. Consequently, it has become still more difficult to adopt and implement far-reaching institutional reforms. Even so, as the emerging agrarian structure has become a serious constraint to rural development it will be disastrous to postpone the much-needed institutional reforms.||P. S. Appu

Towards the end of the paper certain recent critiques of the model of the Fifth Plan are also evaluated. The economy is at present passing through a period of critical shortages. It is obvious that, in this situation, selectivity in programmes designed to achieve desirable socio-economic goals is crucial. The attempt in this paper is to highlight implementable policy options. Given the existing difficulties, it is quite likely that unless selected well-planned initiatives are taken, the process of planning as we have known it in the country is liable to be discredited.||Yoginder K.

31/8/1974- ||review of management, august 1974||4363938||Stock Valuation Rule: Case for Revision||Continuance of the 'lower of cost or market' rule for stock valuation is totally indefensible. To allow taxpayers to anticipate losses on inventory valuation but not gains may be prudent on the part of accountants but does not stand to reason for purposes of taxation. It almost amounts to presenting Government Revenue with a heads-I-win-tails-you-lose alternative. In the context of an inflationary situation, the 'lower of cost or market' rule operates to negate one of the important objectives of progressive taxation by allowing postponement of taxes on the gains of price rise and thus helping to support inventory accumulation. Such postponement is advantageous in more than one way in conditions where credit is scarce. The conservative rule of stock-valuation directly contributes to the capacity for stock-holding. A rough calculation shows that the amount involved in tax-postponement facilitated by the current rule of inventory valuation is by no means negligible and may amount to an interest-free loan of Rs 300 crores for the organised sector alone, the interest on which, at the rate of 15 per cent per annum, works out to Rs 45 crores.||Amaresh Bagchi

Towards this goal, the Indian leadership is endeavouring to evolve a consensus, together with its counterparts in South Asia, on the issues of peace, security and stability that are vital to itself and also to the neighbouring regimes. As a natural corollary, India's leadership is keen to strengthen such governments in South Asia which would be amenable to its perception of the subcontinent and willing to work towards the evolution of the desired consensus. The removal of minor irritants like the Kachchativu territorial dispute is part of the movement towards achieving this consensus.||S. D. Muni

They have not been able to break the hold of moneylender-traders over the farmers in the sale of agricultural produce. Should the marketing societies, therefore, be abandoned? To answer this question, a detailed study of individual societies is necessary. The societies should be assessed for their potential as future market forces, not by their performance judged against a few general criteria which are in any case more relevant to loan schemes than to marketing operations. This article records the findings of one such detailed study carried out in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra.||Sandra McLaren

31/8/1974- ||special articles||4363941||India's Self-Inflicted Defence Burden||A comparison of India's defence spending with that of China and Pakistan shows that in 1970 the ratio of defence expenditure to GNP is 3.7 per cent for Pakistan - which is no higher than India's. China's defence ratio, which is at best an approximation, is certainly much higher - it is close to eight per cent-but then China, as we know, has been confronting many adversaries, including at least one super military power, all across its wide borders. If we use some other indices of defence spending, India is certainly ahead of these two countries. The average rate of growth in defence spending in India over the period 1961-1971 was 16.5 per cent per annum which was higher than that of China and practically all the European and North American countries. Even for the developing countries around the world, the average growth rate was only 12 per cent per annum. Moreover, the average growth rate of the numerical strength of our armed forces during the same period was five per cent per annum and this was higher than that of most countries of the developed as well as developing world. Against this, Pakistan's armed forces grew at an average rate of 3.8 per cent during 1961-1970, Iran's at 2.9 per cent and China's at 3.9 per cent. What is far more serious is the dire economic cost of our large military expenditure. The expansion in our defence spending during the 1960s has resulted in a whole decade of slackened development. Any recommendation that we should further expand our military expenditure must, therefore, be viewed in terms of its economic costs; certainly it must be established that this is the least-cost solution to our defence problems. In addition, in view of the extreme poverty of our people and the stagnant nature of our economy at present as well as the inherent rigidities in defence spending, it becomes doubly important that we compare and evaluate the economic costs of getting involved in yet another war vis-a-vis the costs of attempting to avoid a war.||Ved P.

The author has picked a few studies on tubewells and attempted to probe some of the major economic claims being advanced in favour of private tubewells. The economic underpinnings of the thesis that private tubewells are superior to public tubewells appear to be weak on closer scrutiny. Also examined is the problem of 'mismanagement' of state tubewells, which is the root cause of disenchantment with them in several quarters.||B. D. Dhawan

According to official statistics, by the second week of December 1971 about 6.8 million evacuees had been housed in camps and another 3.1 million were staying with friends and relatives. As many as 827 state camps and 19 Central camps accommodated one of the largest migrant movements in history. This three-part study concentrates on those who were temporarily settled at the Chandpara and Bokchora camps in the district of 24-Parganas in West Bengal. Part III looks at the migration of the evacuees back to Bangladesh and the manner in which it was achieved. It also discusses some theoretical formulations regarding the refugees. Part II had examined the organisational set-up of the camps, the relations between hosts and guests in and around the camps and the adoptive capacities of the evacuees in their new environment. Part I had dealt with the socio-economic background of the evacuees, the events leading to their uprootment and the trek to sanctuary.||Partha N. Mukherji

This paper seeks to study a case of rapid tractorisation in a dry and, by the standards of the 'green revolution' regions, fairly backward area. On the face of it, agro-climatic conditions in the region make the tractor a most uneconomic and wasteful innovation. In fact, it is found that it is precisely these conditions which have contributed the most to the quick spread of tractor cultivation in the area.||N. S. Jodha
13/4/1974- ||special articles||4363578||On the Latin American View of Underdevelopment||The theory stemming from the work of Latin American, mainly Chilean, economists is here examined from various points of view. The paper is divided into four sections. The first part presents the Latin American perspective by discussing the ideas of eminent scholars. Building upon this, the second part deals with what may justifiably be called the Latin American Theory of Underdevelopment. The third section attempts to place this Latin American Theory in the more general background of the history of economic ideas. The study makes it unnecessary to point out what a promise the work of the Latin American, especially Chilean, scholars holds out for students of society everywhere. Therefore, in section four, only a brief evaluation is attempted and some conclusions are drawn.||Vinod Vyasulu

Ramsay Muir's dictum, ' bureaucracy is like fire; invaluable as a servant, ruinous when it becomes the master', is applicable to the officials of the Historical Division of the External Affairs Ministry, as they were able to hamstring Nehru's original diplomacy which sought to work for a modus vivfendi with China, solving the boundary problems on a compromise basis. The official decision to keep the records of the External Affairs Ministry dealing with the Sino-Indian frontier from 1914 to June 1954 out of bounds for independent scholars has helped the Ministry to maintain till today a curtain of ignorance over the true border legacy of the British Raj. The history of the Sino-Indian frontier still remains hidden to most of us.

28/9/1974- ||special article||4364030||Political Mobilisation and Ethnicity among Adi-Dravidas in a Bombay Slum||Among the first things that hit the eye when setting foot in 'Shantinagar', and other slums like it in Bombay city, are the flags of political parties fluttering in the breeze. Picketed here and there are the flags of the Dravida Munnetra Kazagham, the Republican Party, the Congress, the Shiv Sena and the Muslim League. What does this mean? Are these flags just for show or are they signs of real political life, activity, involvement and consciousness? This paper attempts a partial answer to these questions. The first purpose of the paper is to describe the political life and its extent among the Adi-Dravidas of 'Shantinagar'. The second purpose is to explain this high level of political mobilisation - not in terms of historical origin but rather in terms of ongoing processes which maintain this political mobilisation. The third purpose is to offer some speculations on what such a limited case study can suggest about political processes and events in India. Finally, the paper is offered as some refutation of the suggestion that squatters in 'Shantinagar' are some sort of "living dead" without any kind of social life.||Owen M. Lynch

Considering a village of 500 persons, 250 cattle and 100 houses, it is shown that, despite a 75 per cent dung collection efficiency, a low bio-gas yield of 3 cft per lb dry dung will provide a total energy of about 667.5 KWH per day at a generating cost of about 5 paise per KWH. This energy output is over 30 per cent more than the 500 KWH per day now consumed by such villages from both commercial and non-commercial energy sources. Further the bio-gas energy output is sufficient for 10 pumpsets (200 KWH per day), 5 industries (50 KWH per day), one light in every house (67.5 KWH per day), energy for cooking in every house (200 KWH per day), and 150 KWH per day for miscellaneous purposes. In contrast, rural electrification programmes are only targeting for about 100 KWH per day thus compelling the continued use of non-commercial fuels, and as a consequence, the continued loss of fertiliser and forest through the burning of dung and firewood. The items for a cost-benefit comparison of bio-gas energy production vs rural electrification are tabulated, and appear to favour the former. In addition, the bio-gas plants will produce about 295 tonnes per year of organic manure, corresponding to about 4.4 tonnes of nitrogen per year from which the minimum additional yield of foodgrains may be expected to be about 22 tonnes. This fertiliser output is more than the village's requirements on the basis of current average consumptions of nitrogen per hectare. Further, fertiliser production from bio-gas plants appears to have several advantages over production from large-scale coal-based plants from the point of view of the saving of capital and the generation of employment. Despite these obvious benefits which are likely to accrue from currently available bio-gas plants, it is stressed that drastic reductions in plant cost must be achieved to prevent the Government plans from being woefully inadequate for exploiting the full potential of bio-gas production of energy and fertiliser. The concept of solar energy plantations to grow plant matter for fermentation in bio-gas plants is described; and calculations are presented to show that one acre of a water hyacinth plantation can produce in a bio-gas plant about 165 KWH per day in addition to 1.23 tonnes per year of nitrogen in fertiliser and 0.37 tonne per year of edible protein. The following crucial socio-economic problem will be generated by the installation of bio-gas plants in a village: if the programme is not intended to serve the rural rich only, then the energy demands of villagers who do not own cattle must be satisfied, failing which they will continue burning dung cakes and firewood. The solution to this problem will determine the success of the bio-gas programme from the village and national point of view. The concluding part of the paper contains a listing of a number of major R and D problems. The range and character of these problems require that they be tackled by major institutions.||C. R.

02/11/1974- ||special articles||4364135||What Is a Famine?||The theme of this essay is that greater and more sober attention to the weather cycle, both contemporary and historical, will yield rich rewards in the form of more regularly successful development policies. Policymakers must recognise that over centuries the Indian system has developed certain insurance mechanisms to cope with the consequences of at least some levels of weather cycle failure. Limits on the ability to respond to every level of crisis derives not so much from institutional defects as from a generalised frailness of the economy which is due to poverty that prevents adequate investment in various types of insurance. Policymakers must recognise that resources shifted to regions of weather failure are drained from other regions where suffering may be as great but may be differently distributed. To the extent that annual visitations of rain failure in various parts of the country must be expected and short-run relief must be provided, specific allocations for these statistically probable events should be explicitly assigned within the formal plans and budgets. Considerable effort should be focused on development and expansion of self-insurance schemes that require a minimum of bureaucratic discrimination. The impact of a weather cycle on the poorest classes in the system only highlights problems that derive from their generalised poverty and not specifically from the weather cycle. This means that the position of the poor can be improved only marginally through the regular 'crisis allocations'. Their salvation must come via decisions that accelerate the long- rate of economic growth.||Morris David Morris

The conflict took the form of a confrontation between the Indian Mining Association, affiliated to the Bengal Chamber of Commerce, which had long represented the collective interests of the bigger European coal companies, and the Indian Mining Federation, newly organised in 1913 to promote unity among Indian colliery owners and affiliated to the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce. The conflict between European and Indian coal interests, however, gave way to combination against labour agitation and political unrest at the end of the First War. The Indian Mining Federation and the Indian Mining Association were equally worried over the industrial strikes which took place during the mass upsurge of the Non-Co-operation Movement and were determined, if necessary, to meet the demand for increased wages by a complete lock-out.||Ratna Ray,Rajat Ray

The effort to remove racial economic imbalances has concentrated on the uplift of the Malays. Impoverished Indians and Chinese have generally been left out of these economic development programmes. The poor Indians, in particular, have not had enough political leverage to draw the attention of the government to their economic condition. With an Indian 'rentier' class unable to employ him and with the Chinese capitalists and the Malay ruling class unconcerned about him, the Indian labourer, politically unorganised and, therefore, powerless, is the lost man of Malaysia.||Jawid Laiq

Second, since the budget is a major instrument for implementing economic policies, one may reasonably hope to discern in it the policy-frame for the Fifth Plan.||

Viewing these transactions as constituting a market for leased land, the analysis seeks to bring out the features of this market as reflected in the comparative characteristics of lessees and lessors participating in the market and the pattern of inter-relationship among these participants arising from lease transactions. The results are reported primarily to suggest the utility of the approaches used in analysing the research and policy issues relating to the question of tenancy. However, they could also be of some substantive interest to researchers for the glimpses they provide into the nature of lease transactions prevailing in a sample of villages located in Maharashtra and Gujarat on the eve of the implementation of an important piece of tenancy reform in 1957.||V.

Cities with a sophisticated industrial base or with a pre-eminence of administrative and educational services display higher literacy rates. Low literacy rates are characteristic of cities in which Muslims or Scheduled Castes form a substantial segment of the population. Broadly speaking, south Indian cities are distinguished by higher literacy rates than the north Indian ones.||Gopal Krishan,Madhav Shyam

The author hypothesises that: (i) the level of farm production is significantly higher on farms where the decision-maker is literate than where the decision-maker is illiterate; (ii) the levels of education of farm decision-maker and the levels of farm production have a positive, continuous relationship; and, (iii) the levels of education of the farm decision-maker have either no, or negligible, effect on farm production in situations of extreme farm size. The theoretical model is developed in Section I. The statistical results are presented in Section II. And the last Section contains the main conclusions of the study.||Baldev Singh

A sympathetic review of the work of these institutions would find a lot of solid data on the way things are (or were) and some analyses and judgments on who is benefiting how much, and why. A critical review, on the other hand, might assess the facts and framework as static and past-oriented and the reports as reflecting a judicial and "outsider-critic" posture, rather than that of a participant who faces all the constraints of the real-world situation. The purpose of this brief note is to point to the urgent social need for institutions which will effectively work on the analysis of public policy and design of public systems along with surveys of the alternative futures which may befall us.||J.

30/11/1974- ||review of management, november 1974||4364199||Stock Price Level: A Predictive Analysis||The level of stock prices and their movements over time have always been of prime interest to people-as large investors intent on making a 'killing' on the market, or small ones more concerned with finding a relatively safe depository for their savings. In the last twenty years or so, a number of fairly detailed studies have been made to determine the factors which most affect stock price movements. These studies usually focused on an industry and the individual firms therein, and attempted to isolate the attributes which made the stocks of one company more desirable than another's. Distinct from these 'micro' type studies, other researches of the 'macro' variety have been made. These studies attempted to draw a linkage between movements in the general stock prices and the movements of certain other broad general economic indicators; and hence to try and predict the future levels of stock prices. It is the attempt of this paper also to examine the relationship between the level of stock prices in one time period and some general economic indicators of the previous time period. The paper is divided into five major sections. In the first section, is presented the conceptual basis of the analysis. In the second, a brief review is made of some earlier literature on which our analysis is based. The third and fourth sections cover the data itself and the analysis of the data. In the fifth section, the analysis is summarised and its likely limitations indicated.||Pronab Sen

22/6/1974- ||special article||4363758||India: An Arrangement at Stake||The country is today in the throes of a crisis much worse than any that has plagued it since Independence. The economy has ceased to progress. Per capita income is probably lower than it was a decade ago. Prices are rising by about 30 per cent a year. The government's food procurement and distribution policies are in disarray. The public distribution system for essential commodities is now completely at the mercy of those very traders whom the government had sought to drive out of the wheat trade last year and whom it has often accused of profiteering and anti-social behaviour. The much-advertised Fifth Five-Year Plan has been buried amidst ignominious bickering even before its official commencement. The document itself has not been finalised. The current crisis is the inevitable consequence of the economic and political system that the Indian elite has engineered for its own benefit. Its inner contradictions have paralysed this self-serving system. As the difficulties have become more acute during the past year, economists of all hues have rushed in with their quaint suggestions about money supply, distribution of public outlays among the different sectors, about this control or that licensing procedure. They seem to have proceeded on the assumption that government functionaries do not know what needs to be done. They have not realised that the matters they have talked about - money supply, budgetary deficits and the rest - are just symptoms of a deeper malaise. Our difficulty is not that we have run out of ideas but that our polity has been gravely abused - abused by the very leaders to whom the economists have been peddling their aphrodisiacs. This political arrangement is now straining at the tether. Ideas - old or new, orthodox or unorthodox - will not work till the polity is set right.||Arun Shourie

In view of the great diversity of languages and life styles, we must plan for a highly decentralised TV system in which the satellite plays a small role of providing a national hook-up. In such a system the limited rebroadcast transmitters are part of state-level sub-systems; that is, these receive TV signals from the mother or the central TV station of each sub-system, and not from the satellite. What then is the great point in persisting with the thrice-postponed satellite TV experiment? The futility of half of the experiment - test trial of TV reception by 2,400 community TV receivers fitted with front-end converters and chicken-mesh antennas - is beyond doubt. The investment of about Rs 72 lakhs, with a foreign exchange component of about Rs 5 lakhs, in 2,400 augmentation devices would be a dead loss. And since the test trial is to take place in the UHF band in which ISRO is no longer interested, a successful test trial of satellite technology does not mean anything worthwhile for ISRO's INSAT plan designed in the S-band of the radio spectrum. In short, the experiment can be scrapped forthwith, thus saving about Rs 9 crores.||B. D. Dhawan

There is a well-recognised hierarchy among them. No all of them are untouchable; even among those that are, there are degrees of pollution. There are also religious cleavages among the Scheduled Castes. Despite these differences, however, the Scheduled Castes have been ascribed a clear identity by society and they themselves are growing aware of a shared status. This paper examines some aspects of the historical process by which the Scheduled Castes in Andhra Pradesh - and in particular in the coastal districts of the state - have gained a sense of shared identity.||Uma Ramaswamy

His anti-Brahmin movement had elements of Jyotiba Phule's Satyashodhak movement in Maharashtra and also a secessionist content. Even after Independence, Naicker's movement continued to represent the strong Tamil reaction to Brahminism as also the assertion of Tamil indentity vis-a-vis the rest of India. Much as the dynamics of his movement are incomprehensible to orthodox Marxists, it did not inhibit the communists from making use of Naicker's following at more than one point in the history of electoral politics. Even an integrationist and anti-secessionist force like the Congress found his support welcome somewhere along the way. Ramaswami Naicker needs to be assessed in some detail if only because his politics still matters, albeit in one part of the country.||Mohan Ram

To explain this development, it is necessary to understand the monopoly houses' behaviour with respect to fixed capital investment. For this purpose, the investment decision itself has to be identified. The investment decision is not a simple decision. It has a structure. The identification of this structure has important implications. This paper is an attempt at understanding some of these aspects. In Section I of the paper, a detailed attempt was made to identify the structure of Indian monopoly houses' investment decisions, conceptually as well as empirically. In Section II certain underlying attributes of the structure were sought to be highlighted in terms of the economics of pre-emption.

This paper discusses the special advantages of the bamboo tubewell and the remarkable results achieved in the districts of Saharsa and Purnea in Bihar. The success of the bamboo tubewell in Saharsa and Purnea has thrown into bold relief the pressing necessity to enforce ceiling and tenancy laws. These two districts are well known for extreme inequality in ownership of land. Big landowners are not interested in the intensive cultivation of their holdings and very few among them have gone in for bamboo tubewells. Most of the bamboo tubewells have been sunk by small and medium farmers. Strict implementation of the ceiling law will pave the way for more efficient utilisation of the available land. A considerable part of the cultivated area in the two districts, particularly in Purnea, is cultivated through share-croppers. It is unlikely that these lands will be irrigated by bamboo tubewells until permanent and heritable rights are conferred on the share-croppers. Strict enforcement of ceiling and tenancy laws is thus a condition precedent for the optimum utilisation of groundwater resources in the districts of Purnea and Saharsa.

Ramsay Muir's dictum, 'bureaucracy is like fire; invaluable as a servant, ruinous when it becomes the master', is applicable to the officials of the Historical Division of the External Affairs Ministry who were able to hamstrung Nehru's original diplomacy which sought to work for a modus vivendi with China, solving the boundary problems on a compromise basis. The official decision to keep the records of the External Affairs Ministry dealing with the Sino-Indian frontier from 1914 to June 1954 out of bounds for independent scholars has helped the Ministry to maintain till today a curtain of ignorance over the true border legacy of the British Raj. The history of the Sino-Indian frontier still remains hidden to most of us. [The first part of this article, published last week, covered the period 1947 to 1954.]||Karunakar Gupta

The social importance of the pharmaceutical industry is such that in recent years it has been subjected to increasing enquiry and criticism in several countries. It is an indication of the industry's power that few of these criticisms have led to reforms in its basic structure. Part I of this paper, which appeared last week, examined the main characteristics of the international pharmaceutical industry, highlighting the anomalies and distortions that exist because of the peculiar structure of the drugs market and because of the great oligopolistic power exercised by the leading firms. The implications of the structure of the international pharmaceutical industry for the developing countries, to which many of its less desirable features are transferred wholesale, are discussed in Part II of the article published below. The additional social costs imposed on these countries by their playing host to the drug multinationals are described, using the Indian case as an example. The options open to the governments of the developing countries to reduce the cost of obtaining drugs are also considered.||Sanjaya Lall

25/5/1974- ||special articles||4363676||Environment and Styles of Development||The merits of growth are today being questioned and, curiously enough, both the Left and the Right are dividing up into the opponents and champions of growth. The over-simplifications of the debate notwithstanding, we should not fail to observe the emerging political practice which has several claims upon our interest. The long-term future is becoming operational, the notion of organising possible futures and choosing a desired future is gaining acceptance, an approach to planning which is both global and normative at the same time is beginning to take the place of extrapolation, and the systems approach is replacing the sectoral method legitimised by Cartesianism. The hope of achieving continuous economic and social development hand in hand with rational management of the environment presupposes a redefinition of all objectives and all methods of action. The environment is a dimension of development, and must therefore be internalised at every decision-making level. Problems of resources, energy, environment, population and development cannot, in fact, be correctly understood unless they are examined in relation to one another; and this implies planning within a unified conceptual framework.||Ignacy Sachs

Not only has the exemption limit been raised, there has been also a reduction in rates at all levels of taxable income. Obviously this is an extraordinary measure to have been taken by the government in the present state of the economy when the Exchequer is so much in need of funds. Yet these concessions do not seem to have attracted the attention of the critics of government finance to the extent one would have expected they would.||A. K. Das Gupta
03/8/1974- ||special articles||4363896||Small Farmers' Development Agency: Experience in Surat District||The limited experience of the working of the Small Farmers' Development Agency programme in Surat district suggests that the strategy devised by the Agency for small and marginal farmers in the district is such that these farmers in the relatively backward areas would not be able to benefit much in the short run, whereas farmers in the relatively better-off areas would benefit substantially from the programme. Even in the long run, to what extent the weaker sections in farming in the backward areas would gain from the programme would depend upon the efficient functioning of the infrastructure of the co-operative and other institutions which the SFDA is endeavouring to develop and on the availability of other infrastructural facilities which are a precondition of the success of activities, like dairying, development of which is considered to be strategic by the Agency for the betterment of the weaker sections in these areas. In the light of the Surat experience, two general observations about the SFDA programme may be made. First, since the SFDA programme covers 'potentially viable' small farmers, it deserves to be considered whether the concept of viability should be uniform for all parts of the region or whether it should be determined with reference to the significant variations that might obtain within the region in such matters as customary standards of living. Secondly, having formulated the appropriate strategy, the implementation of which would help small farmers become viable, the SFD Agencies must work out the financial as well as other requirements of putting the programme through. Having worked out the full financial implications of the goal of making small farmers viable, the programmes can be phased out over a few years, keeping in view the availability of financial resources.||Mahendra D.

23/11/1974- ||special articles||4364181||International Pharmaceutical Industry and Less-Developed Countries: I: Oligopolistic Power of Leading Firms||The pharmaceutical industry is one of the most 'multinational' of modern manufacturing industries; the firms which dominate it in the developed countries also operate in almost every less-developed country outside the socialist bloc. The social importance of the pharmaceutical industry is such that in recent years it has been subjected to increasing enquiry and criticism in several countries. It is an indication of the industry's power that few of these criticisms have led to reforms in its basic structure. Part I of this paper, which appears this week, examines the main characteristics of the international pharmaceutical industry, highlighting the anomalies and distortions that exist because of the peculiar structure of the drugs market and because of the great oligopolistic power exercised by the leading firms. The implications of the structure of the international pharmaceutical industry for the developing countries, to which many of its less desirable features are transferred wholesale, are discussed in Part II of the article, which will appear next week. The additional social costs imposed on these countries by their playing host to the drug multinationals are described, using the Indian case as an example. The options open to the governments of the developing countries to reduce the cost of obtaining drugs are also considered.||Sanjaya Lall

The details of the planning model underlying the Approach document were supplied in a Technical Note that was circulated to the panel of economists in April 1973. The same planning model (with a change in the price base from 1971-72 to 1972-73) is said to form the basis of the Draft Fifth Five-Year Plan released recently. The objective of this paper, the first part of which was published last week, is to evaluate the planning model underlying the Approach document. The model is found to be inadequate in its institutional specification and operationally unsatisfactory. The empirical basis for the three major policy-oriented conclusions emerging from it is found to be a poor approximation to the realised experience in the recent past, thereby making suspect their economic feasibility in practice. Because of the inadequate institutional specification of the model and the absence of a simultaneously worked-out policy-frame, the problems of evolving policy measures ex post are shown to be intractable. It is not at all surprising, therefore, that the commitments on self-reliance and removal of poverty have been considerably diluted in the Draft Plan-although certain exogenous factors have been held responsible for this, especially for throwing overboard the objective of self-reliance. Even in the absence of these exogenous factors, the pronounced biases in the numerical parametric specification of the model, the inappropriate institutional specification and the socio-political infeasibilities involved in working out the policy-frame ex post facto for the redistributive objective would have led to the same result.||Suresh D.

The colonial elements in the pattern of entrepreneurship that emerged were collaboration between foreign and native capitalists and the growth of the function of the middleman. The banian was one form of such early collaboration between foreign and Indian business. This brief note presents a document which appears to be highly useful in understanding some of the functions of the early nineteenth century Banian in Bengal and the role which he performed in the economic activities of the period.||Dipesh Chakrabarty,Ranajit Dasgupta

At this stage of the country's economic development, no official 'administrative' statistics would provide a correct picture of the reality regarding wealth distribution. The only method of obtaining such a valid picture is through systematic surveys. However, till such surveys are undertaken, it may be worthwhile to attempt, on the basis of available official statistics, to frame a rough pattern of the distribution of wealth and to indicate broad trends over a period of time. The present study has this modest objective in view.||V. M. Jakhade,S. L. Shetty

It is based on field work there at three points of time (in 1963, 1966-67, and 1970-71), and includes both intensive village work and detailed interviewing of people in the agriculture administration. The question is commonly asked, what kind of a contribution the social anthropologist can make to questions of this kind, over and above that of the economist or person specialising in development problems. The author hopes that the answer to this question will emerge from what follows. What is actually happening can often be seen most clearly by observation on the ground and by looking at who is actually doing what-not just by examining aggregate statistics.||Joan P. Mencher

The banks must be losing around Rs 10 lakhs per year for every 500 cabinets in metropolitan cities. The consequences of the faulty pricing of lockers seem more alarming when it is realised that the benefit goes to the section of the society which, being relatively more affluent, does not deserve it. Avoidance of such a loss could actually subsidise, for every 500 cabinets, the lending of Rs 2 crores under the differential interest rates schemes.||Paul Mampilly

13/7/1974- ||special articles||4363831||India and the World Tea Economy||This article describes the policy failures in the tea sector during the 1960s and 1970s and suggests measures that would enable the industry to continue to expand its output for domestic and international markets while pursuing the possibility of an international tea agreement to regulate export availability of tea and to raise the market price. Obviously, such an agreement would have to cover policies relating to expansion of acreage, replanting, replacement and domestic consumption, on the one hand, and to market sharing and quotas, on the other. Any tea agreement would, at the same time, have to make provision for a well-planned and heavily financed promotion plan designed to expand tea usages. The revival of India's tea in world markets from 1975 to 1985 will require an integrated promotion to expand the exportable surplus even as domestic consumption expands, a working agreement to raise price and export earnings, and a promotional strategy to expand tea's market in competition with coffee and other beverages.||K.

A glance through his writings is enough to convince anyone of the wide range of his work: from industrial evolution and current industrial development, to problems in agriculture and attempts at agricultural reform, to education, the federal problem in India, the Indian Constitution, city and town development, regional planning, to social change, caste and untouchability, social obligations of advanced sections of society, etc. In each of these and other areas, he laid great stress on the systematic garnering of facts, made careful study of the underlying relationships, and suggested immediate and long-term measures that could be adopted without upsetting the existing framework. Joining the Planning Commission was regarded as a natural culmination of his wide-ranging activities and his long and sustained work on the problems of the Indian economy. This article attempts a review of the last phase of Gadgil's life when he headed the Planning Commission.||A. R. Kamat

The Planning Commission's projected 7.6 per cent annual increase in export earnings in the Fifth Plan is very unlikely to be achieved, given present policies. A 5 to 6 per cent growth is a much more likely outcome and the shortfall could amount to Rs 270 crores in the final year of the Plan. A faster growth of exports in the Fifth Plan period calls for new policies. Creating new export capacity and overcoming raw material shortages and supply bottlenecks will call for action in different directions-export turnover subsidies, processing zones, a raw material bank for key export industries and the direct creation of new or expanded export units in a number of fast growing industries where present capacity is limited.||Angus Hone

1/8/1974- ||aborted political change||4363918||The Upsurge in Gujarat||The political upheaval which shook Gujarat for full two months early this year was unprecedented in the history of post-Independence India. No town remained untouched by the upsurge. Tensions also prevailed in some parts of the countryside. The agitation, spearheaded by the student community, took various forms. During the agitation about one hundred persons died and a large number were injured in police firings at different places. The Chief Minister, Chimanbhai Patel, despite his claim of having a majority in the state Assembly, resigned on February 9, 1974. The Assembly was suspended and President's rule was imposed in the state. Later, 95 of the 168 MLAs resigned from the house. Consequently, the Central government was compelled to dissolve the Assembly on March 15, 1974. Corporators of Ahmedabad, Baroda and Surat resigned en bloc and the municipal corporations were superseded. Several Congressmen resigned from the party. Different socio-economic and political groups participated in the agitation for different purposes, raising such diverse issues as corruption, blackmarketing, price rise, denationalisation, rationing, civil liberties, injustice to Gujaratis and Gujarat, etc. But finally all the issues converged on two common demands, resignation of the Chief Minister and later dissolution of the state Assembly. The reasons for making these demands differed from group to group. To the majority of the agitators, it was a demand to overthrow 'corrupt' politicians. The opposition political parties were interested in dethroning the Congress party in the state. Some were interested in discrediting the 'progressive measures' of the ruling party, such as the wheat trade take-over, land legislation, etc. There was thus neither unity nor clarity regarding the steps to follow after the dissolution of the Assembly. This paper is an attempt to observe the major events in the course of the agitation with a view to understanding the agitation as a social phenomenon. The paper seeks to examine the following questions: What role did the different groups play in smothering or accelerating the agitation? How and why did the agitation take different shapes at different stages? Which issues were highlighted by which groups and why? This is an explanatory study based on interviews with those who participated in the agitation, survey data, newspaper reports as well as the writer's own observations. The paper is divided into two parts. The first part deals in detail with the prevailing tensions in Gujarat state. The nature of the agitation and the character of the participants are discussed in the second part.||Ghanshyam Shah

While according to earlier studies wage rates improved significantly in real terms only in Punjab (including Haryana and Kerala), our extension of the series to 1971-72 shows that improvement in real wages took place also in Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. However, these states still account for less than 30 per cent of the agricultural labour force in the country. This study also brings out that inter-state disparities in money wage rates have tended to widen since 1964-65.||A. V. Jose
02/2/1974- ||special articles||4363399||The Sixth Finance Commission: An Evaluation of Its Recommendations||The redistributive bias in the Sixth Finance Commission's recommendations, the dovetailing of Plan and non-Plan expenditure and the attempt to reduce 'discretionary' assistance are noteworthy. The approach adopted by the Commission of devising a scheme of non-Plan resource devolution having the same overall objectives as those of national planning was perhaps the best possible in the circumstances. However, the Commission could have relied on this approach all along and evolved a scheme of need-based resource devolution instead of considering each item of devolution separately. Further, unless the financial discipline in the form of realisation of revenue targets, restraining inessential expenditure, upgrading the levels of social services, improvement in the financial performance of public undertakings, etc, implicit in the Commission's recommendations, is observed, these recommendations will not have the desired impact.

Moreover, the methods of recording have not been standardised making it difficult to compare results of different studies. This is a preliminary report on the pre-harvest physical loss of aman rice caused by field rats in the agricultural farm of the Indian Statistical Institute in Giridih in south Bihar. This preliminary report suggests that further investigations are required in different tracts of India, on research farms as also on farmers' fields to get a clear picture of the pre-harvest loss of foodgrains about which we hardly have any dependable statistics at present. A data-based estimate of the foodgrain losses due to rodents might reveal that, if such losses are prevented or minimised, the present production is enough not only to meet normal national requirement but to have a reasonable reserve for emergencies.||Subodh Kumar Roy

08/6/1974- ||special articles||4363717||Reflections of an Indian Scholar||In India, the author suggests, there is today a wave of what may be called cosmological nationalism, an impetus toward repossessing one's intellectual categories even as one has repossessed one's political fate and one's cultural climate. When there is talk of an Indian sociology and an Indian political science, sometimes what is at stake is a protest against the ill fit of Western social science; sometimes a hope of uncontaminated or less contaminated indigenous categories by which to grasp reality; sometimes a wish that the social scientists and other intellectuals (Indian and foreign) shape up, do relevant social science, and support official visions of the Indian future. Of these only the first two are relevant here. Cosmological nationalism may be, at its narrowest, merely a game for home consumption. At its best, it may be a step toward Indian participation in the reconstruction of a universal social science. The foreign area scholars who work on India and the Indian social scientists have both some unique perspective to bring to that reconstruction.||Susanne Hoeber Rudolph

One has only to see the recent increases in foodgrain prices, steel prices, coal prices, transport costs, prices of imported items such as metals and chemicals, and wage costs to realise that the volume of bank credit could not but have reflected these steep increases. It is idle to say that by an even more stringent credit policy and high interest rate policy we could have hoped to succeed in reversing the price situation.||H. T. Parekh
20/7/1974- ||special articles||4363856||Working Capital and Credit Needs of Foodgrains Distribution in India||This paper attempts to estimate the working capital required for the procurement and distribution of foodgrains. To arrive at the financial requirements for foodgrains distribution, estimates of the marketed surplus are needed. Instead of assuming a certain percentage of the total foodgrains production as the marketed surplus, a different technique was employed to estimate the marketed surplus. Based on the prices and stocks of foodgrains required at the beginning of the months and the marketed surplus of foodgrains, the working capital requirements were estimated for different years. The estimates of working capital for foodgrains show that the available bank credit met only 38 per cent of the maximum working capital required in 1972-73. Hence bank credit cannot be blamed for making possible the hoarding of foodgrains. In fact, by not supplying the necessary working capital for foodgrains, the banking system has forced foodgrain distribution to depend on non-banking sources. It has thus increased the cost of financing the working capital and helped the price increase of foodgrains.||D. K. Desai,V. Ramachandran

The argument that a cut in personal income-tax rates was necessary to check tax evasion could have been taken a little more seriously had the measure been accompanied by a widening of the tax base and by other steps to make the tax system more equitable and efficient, of which the most urgent was the adoption of the family as the tax unit. In fact, the trend is in precisely the opposite direction. Similarly, the campaign for lower tax rates on the ground of incentives is a case of special pleading by the already well-off. To think that the economy will be revived by submitting to their demands is to build one's hopes on myth, not reality.||

Broadly, the distributive disparities affecting the Scheduled Castes are at three levels: between the Scheduled Castes and the general population; between the various Scheduled Castes; and among Scheduled Castes in a particular district or area.||K.

According to official statistics, by the second week of December 1971 about 6.8 million evacuees had been housed in camps and another 3.1 million were staying with friends and relatives. As many as 827 state camps and 19 Central camps accommodated one of the largest migrant movements in history. This three-part study concentrates on those who were temporarily settled at the Chandpara and Bokchora camps in the district of 24-Parganas in West Bengal. Part I deals with the socio-economic background of the evacuees, the events leading to their uprootment and the trek to sanctuary. Part II will examine the organisational set-up of the camps, the relations between hosts and guests in and around the camps and the adaptive capacities of the evacuees in their new environment. Part III will deal with the migration back to Bangladesh and the manner in which it was achieved. [I am thankful to the Department of Sociology, University of Delhi, for having given me a small grant and duty leave for my field work.

The purpose is to construct different scenarios of the probable election results on the basis of electoral trends over time, to assess strengths and weaknesses of different parties and to examine changes in voter alignments and attitudes and their implications for party support. The main data for this analysis come from a survey of public opinion conducted in Azamgarh district during the autumn of 1973. Apart from administering an unstructured questionnaire to 108 respondents in the district, the author travelled around all over the eastern belt of the state conducting informal interviews. These data collected during the field work are supplemented by aggregate data on the performance of parties in previous elections.||V. B. Singh

They comprise households who cultivate land mainly with the help of their family labour and at the same time supply labour to other cultivating class. Some of them own some cultivable land; quite a significant number lease in land mostly on crop-sharing basis; a sizeable section is landless agricultural labour. Almost all the semi-proletariat households are deficit ones in the sense that their bare minimum consumption expenditures exceed their incomes. They are thus forced to take consumption loans both in cash and in kind from the big landowning class. The stipulated rates of interest on these loans are very high and, leave aside the loan, even full payment of interest is beyond the means of the semi-proletariat. The big landowning class, however, does not insist on full payment even in the long run. It often forces the debtors to sell their assets (mostly land) but rarely for complete discharge of the debt obligation. It uses the debt obligation to force upon the direct producers in agriculture a system of unequal exchanges, thereby deriving enormous economic benefits in such forms as cheap and assured labour and better terms for leasing out land.||Pradhan H.

Most relevant, in this context, is the time-phasing of capital expenditures on the projects sanctioned by these institutions in the current and in the previous years. Since there is at present a long time-lag in obtaining and analysing the data on company finances for estimating the capital formation in the corporate sector, our method offers a way out by providing - within the end of a year - an indication of the direction and quantum of investment in the corporate private sector in that year. Even after allowing for price changes, the total capital expenditures by the corporate sector in 1974 would be higher than those in 1973. The new commitments made in 1973 and in early 1974 indicate that investment in certain key industries may however lag behind. Unless there is a dramatic change in the investment climate during 1975 itself, the picture for 1975, moreover, is not encouraging.||C. Rangarajan

30/3/1974- ||review of agriculture, march 1974||4363533||Two Perspectives on Redistribution of Land||Redistribution of agricultural land to achieve equity would be easily recognised as one of those hardy ideas which survive, however lingeringly, despite more than two decades of non-implementation. Given the policy-maker's perspective on redistribution, and on land reforms in general, it is unlikely that the idea of redistribution would ever get out of that twilight zone which separates patently unworkable ideas (recognised as such) from those which are implementable (and implemented) in practice. This, by itself, need not be a matter of much concern but for the fact that with a perspective more in tune with the broad objectives and policies of planning the policy-maker may still be able to squeeze something of value out of the idea of redistribution. More importantly, in the absence of a proper perspective, the opportunities to benefit from the reform-potential of the idea of redistribution may remain unrecognised by the policy-maker as and when they arise. The divergence between the current practice and what it needs to be if the objective is to achieve equity along with elimination of absentee-ownership (in the sense of ownership of land by non-cultivators) suggests that the researcher has possibly been as casual in measuring the scope for redistribution as the policy-maker has been in implementing the programme. Our findings indicate that the measurement of the scope for redistribution calls for far more patience in collecting data and ingenuity in analysing them than are involved in cursory calculations based on distribution of land in a region or a state.||V.

The lower levels of both the caste Hindu and Bodo societies have been wretchedly poor; but the elite among the caste Hindus had been larger, better equipped and better trained as an active partner of a feudal system of exploitation for centuries than the hitherto almost non-existent Bodo elite. Of late, the Bodo elite has been growing in strength and numbers and the conflict for a slice of the pie has been essentially between these elites. The recent agitation over the choice of script for the Bodo language is a manifestation of this conflict. The question of script has got enmeshed with many other issues - political, economic and cultural. This article is an attempt to sort out some of these issues.||M. S. Prabhakar

Medical colleges grew very rapidly and poured out large numbers of physicians who were mostly alienated from the masses of the people. A number of hospitals were opened in the urban areas. Out of the limited resources that were made available for providing preventive services for rural areas, the colonels, with strong "persuasion" from foreign consultants, set aside big chunks for running mass campaigns against specific diseases - malaria, population growth, small-pox, leprosy, trachoma and filariasis. Not only have these campaigns hindered the development of a permanent health services system in the rural areas but almost invariably they have also failed to achieve the set goals. The country was persuaded in the late fifties to invest about Rs 1,010 mn to eradicate malaria by 1966, but after an investment of over Rs 3,500 mn the prospect of doing so by even 1979 do not appear to be particularly bright. The campaign against population growth has turned out to be a similar costly blunder. Social scientists and health educators from abroad helped the colonels to divert attention from the basic malady of the system by raising the bogey of resistance of the villagers to acceptance of the Western system of medicine. Following that reference model, their counterparts in India dutifully echoed their findings and a large number of positions were created to accommodate such professional health educators and social scientists within the system. Findings of a carefully conducted empirical study of health behaviour of rural populations of India have, however, underscored the fact that there is considerable active interest among villagers in acquiring both curative and preventive services. Mostly it is the services which have let the people down, rather than the reverse. Not only are the rural health services very much below what the Bhore Committee's short-term programme had in 1946 described as the "irreducible minimum requirements" and much below the actual demands of the people, but even these very limited services are working at an alarmingly low level of efficiency - one of the main causes for this being the alienation of the health workers and of the institutions for education and training of such workers from the masses of the people.||D.

It gives an estimate of the consumption of 'industrial' and 'agricultural' goods in rural and urban areas over the years from 1952-53 to 1964-65. With these figures it would be possible to construct a major part of the trade between agriculture and industry, or between rural and urban sectors. Apart from shedding light on the issue of inter-sectoral flows, this paper shows that the market for industrial consumption goods in India is, in a sense, shrinking: the percentage of per capita consumer expenditure spent on industrial goods is declining over the years, rather sharply in rural India and mildly in urban. Among various fractile groups of population, the ones at the bottom are increasingly with-drawing from the market for industrial consumer goods. In a word, Indian industry is fast approaching the walls of a restricted market. Although the data presented here cover the period upto only 1964-65, there is no reason to believe that the trend has been arrested since then; in fact, it might have been accelerated further.||Ranjit Sau

1/8/1974- ||aborted political change||4363915||Indian Peasant Uprisings||Indian peasants have a long tradition of armed uprisings, reaching back at least to the initial British conquest and the last decades of Moghul government. For more than 200 years peasants in all the major regions have risen repeatedly against landlords, revenue agents and other bureaucrats, moneylenders, police and military forces. During this period there have been at least 77 revolts, the smallest of which probably engaged several thousand peasants in active support or in combat. About 30 of these revolts must have affected tens of thousands of peasants, and about 12, several hundreds of thousands. The uprisings were responses to deprivation of unusually severe character, always economic, and often also involving physical brutality or ethnic persecution. The political independence of India has not brought surcease from these distresses. Major uprisings under communist leadership since British rule not unnaturally show a continuity of tactics with earlier peasant revolts. Of these, the more successful have involved mass insurrections, initially against specific grievances, and the less successful, social banditry and terrorist vengeance. Both in the case of communist revolts and in that of earlier peasant uprisings, social banditry and terrorist vengeance, when they occurred, appear to have happened in the wake of repression of other forms of revolt. Although the revolts have been widespread, certain areas have an especially strong tradition of rebellion. Bengal has been a hotbed of revolt, both rural and urban, from the earliest days of British rule. Some districts in particular, such as Mymensingh, Dinajpur, Rangpur and Pabna in Bangladesh and the Santhal regions of Bihar and West Bengal, figured repeatedly in peasant struggles and continue to do so. The tribal areas of Andhra Pradesh and the state of Kerala also have long traditions of revolt. Hill regions where tribal or other minorities retain a certain independence, ethnic unity and tactical manoeuvrability, and where the terrain is suited to guerilla warfare, are of course especially favourable for peasant struggles, but these have also occurred in densely populated plain regions such as Thanjavur, where rackrenting, land hunger, landless labour and unemployment cause great suffering.||Kathleen Gough

The existence of a large and growing body of relatively inexperienced managers adds a crucial dimension to this problem. Various organisational strategies have been adopted by banks to attain the desired degree of effectiveness in administering their branches. This article briefly touches upon some of the traditional approaches, such as dispersed controlling offices established in the heart of particular areas, the concept of link branches, and the system of personal visits of headquarters officials to branches. It then discusses in some detail the institution of the Area Superintendent which has been designed by the State Bank of India with the object of providing the controlling authority with yet another instrument of administration. Each bank has naturally to judge for itself whether this new organisational position, or rather this new approach to reducing administrative remoteness, is relevant to its own peculiar needs. As there are rarely any standard solutions in organisational matters, a bank has necessarily to work out a strategy appropriate to its requirement.||Tushar K. Das

The one to benefit most from this electoral phenomenon was, of course, the ruling party. This has caused serious concern about the 'unrepresentativeness' of our electoral system. The widening gap between electoral wishes and poll results has visibly increased with this election. Moerover, while the pre-poll assessments had shown the Congress party all set for a severe drubbing, the results belied such expectations. How did this happen? Why could not the opposition parties, particularly the BKD and Jan Sangh, do better? How could the parties polling less than their tally of votes in the previous elections muster more seats in the Assembly? These are a few important questions, answers to which may throw some light on the working of our electoral system. We propose to examine these questions by focusing our discussion on the following: First, we shall detail briefly the party position in terms of 'then and now', i e, the position brought about by the 1969 elections, the subsequent defections, and the situation obtaining after the 1974 poll. Second, we shall discuss the changing matrix of inter-party competition, and its implications for the future party system in the state. Third, we shall examine the regional support structure of the parties, in terms of their losses and gains between two elections. And, finally, we shall highlight the relationship between the representational apparatus and the party system, as it has grown from one election to another.||V. B. Singh

Their fertility and mortality levels have steadily declined over the past century. In fact, their fertility is so low that despite high life expectancy, the number of Parsis has been declining for more than two decades now. This paper examines the trend in fertility and mortality levels of Parsis. It seeks to examine the transition from high levels of fertility and mortality to low levels and the factors which have brought about this transition. The size and the sex-age composition of the Parsi population are also discussed to facilitate an understanding of their fertility and mortality levels. The article is published in three parts. The first part discussed the size of the Parsi population and the change in the age-sex composition. The level and trends in mortality are examined in the second. The third part will deal with trends in fertility.||Leela Visaria

Inevitably, non-Brahman politics began to develop a centre here as well. But when the non-Brahman challenge was mounted in oona it took on forms that were highly conditioned by the themes of Brahman cultural dominance. Non-Brahmans entered and attempted to control the Ganpati festival, which was founded by Tilak himself with a view to turning a religious occasion into public nationalist propaganda. They engaged in a virulent war of pamphlets and newspapers by an entry into the arena of Brahman literary dominance; they focused their attack not so much on questions of land and Brahman priestly or bureaucratic dominance that troubled the peasantry, but on symbolic issues involving Brahman claims to moral and political leadership. They took up themes that Brahmans had pioneered-themes of nationalism and Hindu unity-and sought to prove that, in these very terms, Brahmans were unfit to lead. Thus it was in Poona that the leadership and alliances developed that were to bring non-Brahmans into the Congress party, and it was in Poona that enemies of Tilak proved to his heirs that the mass leadership to which Tilak had aspired belonged really to them.||Gail Omvedt

27/7/1974- ||special article||4363875||The Oil Crisis: An Economic Analysis and Policy Imperatives||Higher costs and uncertainties of crude oil imports portend a major crisis for India. The estimates are that crude imports may account for around 50 per cent of our export earnings in 1978. The crisis cannot be met without appropriate policies which aim at curbing the misuse of oil products as is currently happening, and at the same time, providing for maximum of essential oil products from a minimal quantum of crude oil. A major proportion of the residual heavystock from crude oil is currently used as furnace oil in industries where alternative sources of energy are domestically available. The same heavystock could, through secondary processes such as hydrocracking, yield large quantities of petrol, kerosene and diesels. About 4.3 million tons of heavystock, if diverted from its use as furnace fuel and reprocessed (through hydrocracking) would yield about 3.2 million tons of kerosene and diesels. The same quantity of these essential products is obtained, through simple refining, by processing about 7.6 million tons of crude oil. Thus, a diversion of 4.3 million tons of heavystock from furnace fuel to hydrocracking would reduce oil imports by as much as 7.6 million tons, reducing the import bill by about Rs 456 crores per annum.||Ramesh Bhatia

The Indian Income-Tax Act bears eloquent testimony to this abiding faith. From book publishing to family planning, not to mention fostering of investment, export promotion, agricultural development, refugee rehabilitation and scientific research, there is hardly any item on the national agenda that does not find some support somewhere in the tax statute. Almost invariably the first act of an individual or a collective body entrusted with or engaging itself in anything with a 'public' pretension is to ask for tax exemption for itself and its donors. Seldom does a committee or study group conclude its report without putting down a plea for some tax incentive among its recommendations. What the saddling of the tax laws with the responsibility for promoting every conceivable worthy cause means to the tax administration and the tax system as a whole does not seem to be anybody's concern. No one bothers to inquire what the cost of a tax incentive is to the community, whether the incentive actually begets the intended benefit and whether allowing a tax concession is always the best method of extending state support for a particular activity.||Amaresh Bagchi

At this stage of the country's economic development, no official 'administrative' statistics would provide a correct picture of the reality regarding wealth distribution. The only method of obtaining such a valid picture is through systematic surveys. However, till such surveys are undertaken, it may be worthwhile to attempt, on the basis of available official statistics, to frame a rough pattern of the distribution of wealth and to indicate broad trends over a period of time. The present study has this modest objective in view. [The first part of this article was published last week.]||V M Jakhade,S L Shetty

The exercise assumes that sufficient buffer stocks would be available to keep prices and quantities of grain consumption constant. It is suggested that, for all grain deliveries, a minimum price be paid immediately, to be followed three months later by a premium which would be increased to a certain maximum when harvests are very poor, or reduced to zero when harvests are plentiful. It is further suggested that minimum prices and premiums (standard and maximum) should be made known before the sowing season. A numerical investigation has shown that, with reasonable values for prices and premiums, acceptable results may be obtained - except probably in Bihar and Rajasthan.||J. Sandee,G. R. Saini

This brief article makes an initial, tentative attempt to suggest some possible lines of enquiry. The Hyderabad economy, while it was of a combined nature, was coming to be dominated by a capitalist tendency. For the large 'feudals', their operations in the capitalist structure were becoming more important than their pre-capitalist exactions. Concurrently with this there was growing at the village level a layer of rich peasants and small landlords, tending to merge into each other. To build a movement on the basis of a multi-class front against the 'feudals', as the CPI tried to do, meant adopting the programme of this last-mentioned layer, who found that the intermediaries - i e, the jagirdars, etc - were impeding their progress. The inability of the Hyderabad State to grant reforms which would have satisfied them was an indication of the weakness, first, of the indigenous bourgeoisie, and, second, of the colonial dependent State whose attempt at developing State capitalism had barely begun. This situation meant that, at an early stage, demands began to be raised which were not simply 'anti-feudal' but were for land and increased wages. And the CPI was completely unprepared for these demands.||Barry Pavier

This is not surprising if it is recalled that when the 'socialistic pattern' was first announced in 1955, Bombay's stock market witnessed a boom. Since subsequent developments seem to have validated Dalal Street's judgment on the character of the 'socialistic pattern', it is pertinent to ask: Is the joint sector really an instrument of control of Indian monopoly? This paper seeks to answer this question. In Section I the author examines the meaning and evolution of the joint sector concept. As a background to finding out its real rationals, Section II illustrates the operation of industrial policy in post-1947 India in relation to the declared objective of reducing the concentration of economic power. In the concluding part the author deals with the nature of the recent capitalist crisis and the extent to which the joint sector is designed to meet the new problems of development of Indian monopoly.||Aurobindo Ghose

It attempts to assess the likely price developments in the period 1974/1980 as the full impact of the 300 per cent oil price increase begins to bite into the competitiveness of synthetic materials and to undermine the balance of payments position of the industrial countries.

The task of environment analysis for corporate planning becomes difficult because of the frequent changes in government policies. Yet it is necessary to formulate an operational framework for environmental analysis for a systematised attempt at strategic planning. We have presented in this paper a list of selected economic and regulatory conditions which have been empirically found to have a significant impact on the business operations of a large and diversified industrial enterprise.||Charan D.

30/3/1974- ||review of agriculture, march 1974||4363534||Notes on Farm Size and Productivity||In this paper the author revisits the debate on the relationship between farm size and productivity with a view to illustrating an approach based on some broad characteristics of rural markets and the nature and extent of participation therein of different groups of peasantry. A large number of studies have examined the hypothesis of the inverse relation between farm size and productivity and suggested a number of explanations, mostly resting on the logic of production decisions in competitive situations. Using data from the published farm management studies carried out in West Bengal, Bombay, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Madras, we examine the explanations already advanced and suggest how the relation between utilisation (and productivity) of inputs and farm size could be interpreted in terms of the unequal and diverse nature of market involvement of different groups of peasantry. The analysis carried out here is merely suggestive of certain hypotheses and the approach is presented only in a rudimentary form. Much more comprehensive data and of a different kind would be needed to develop these hypotheses and to test them.||Krishna Bharadwaj

Two questions still seem relevant from the oint of view of equalisation of educational opportunities for the scheduled castes vis-a-vis others. (1) To what extent can this educational progress be attributed to the special concessions? (2) Is the scheme of special facilities conceived in the spirit of ensuring equality to all the members of the scheduled castes or, in the process, do they suffer from deficiencies that tend to create certain subtle inequalities among them?||Kusum K.

1/8/1974- ||approaches to development||4363914||The Great Leap Forward in China: An Analysis of the Nature of Socialist Transformation||To investigate the rasion d'etre of the Great Leap is to examine problems which are common to all post-revolutionary societies undergoing a process of socialist transformation. The primary problem faced in a post-revolutionary situation is the shortage of capital required for industrialisation, which is a basic pre-requisite for the construction of a socialist society. As the first workers' state in an underdeveloped country, the Soviet Union faced this problem most acutely. It had to generate the resources for industrialisation from an impoverished pre-industrial sector of the economy by pushing down the consumption levels of the masses and alienating powerful elements in the countryside. The use of force necessitated the creation of a powerful and pervasive bureaucratic structure which, in time, usurped the role historically, ascribed to the working class. The Stalinist model of development was almostuniversally taken over by the post-war communist regimes and applied in their respective countries during the early years of their rule. But, within a few years, the counter-developmental tendencies inherent in the model began to make themselves felt, and the pressure to reform the system became irresistible. Recognition of the various problems inherent in the Stalinist model of industrialisation is at least implied in Mao's essays titled "On the Ten Great Relationships" written in 1956 and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions" written in 1957. The Maoist alternative implemented during the Great Leap Forward focuses on an alternative economic strategy. The Great Leap Forward cannot, however, be reduced to a single economic motivation. The Great Leap was the product of a 'vision' rather than a plan. It sought to transform the entire social system.||Prasenjit Duara

The nationalised banks have been ranked on the basis of profitability, volume of business, gross margin, manpower expenses and branch expansion. Some areas for policy changes at the national level are also suggested in the light of the inter-bank comparisons.||Sampat P. Singh

However, the balance sheet is a static position statement of the firm on a certain date. It fails to indicate the dynamic flow of values occurring in the firm throughout a period. The real dynamics of the pressures on cash flows are contained in the firm's income or profit and loss statement. This statement contains all the operational inflows and outflows of values-cash or credit-during a period. The operating cycle concept of working capital discussed here is basically a profit and loss account-based tool.||S. K. Chakraborty

Among the forms of mechanisation in Punjab's agrarian economy, tractors occupy a very important place. Punjab accounted for over 20 per cent of the country's total tractor population in 1970-71. To study the various aspects of tractorisation in Punjab, a field survey was conducted covering 13 villages and 130 tractor-owning households in three districts-Hoshiarpur, Ludhiana and Ferozepur. Some of the results of the survey are presented here.||Kusum Chopra

In other words, there are few studies of changes in voting patterns made in the light of the distribution of political power among the major sub-regions. In several states, such as Orissa, in the absenc of a sub-regional focus, there is insufficient perception of regional politics. The political structure in motion at the sub-regional level has been the most crucial variable in electoral politics in Orissa. Actually, a study of elections from the sub-regional angle affords us a real insight not only into the political conditions of coalition-building but also into spatially dissimilar developments in political recruitment, identification and organisation in the state. The aim of this paper is to analyse the 1974 mid-term polls to the State Assembly by focusing on the sub-regional political process.||Amal Ray

1/8/1974- ||institutional road-blocks||4363908||Socio-Political Factors and Agricultural Policies||The concept of 'trade-off' between growth and improved distribution is used not only to rationalise and perpetuate the prevailing unequal distribution of agricultural land but also to justify the intensive use (per acre) of scarce inputs like fertilisers and water on large farms and in the developed regions when the social product would be greater by spreading such inputs relatively thinly over a larger number of farms in a wider area. In view of their greater capacity to invest and bear risk, large farmers and the developed regions intensify the use of such inputs producing less than socially optimum output. With the introduction of High Yielding Varieties, the divergence between the private and the social optimum is likely to have increased because it is now privately profitable to apply fertilisers in much higher doses than before. A similar argument may apply to the use of irrigation water. The concept of 'productive irrigation' which has become popular after the introduction of HYV can be used for rationalising the appropriation of water by the influential sections in water-scarce regions even when it is socially more profitable to spread the use of water relatively thinly. This suspicion arises because in certain cases 'protective irrigation' practised under traditional irrigation systems has been found to be socially productive as it yields a larger total output. The failure of the current strategy to bring about the promised agricultural growth and employment through the necessary public investments and the redistribution of resources within the agricultural sector has accentuated the problem of unemployment and underemployment in rural areas, particularly because growth of output and employment in the non-agricultural sector has also been slow. The elite has begun to see in this a threat to the existing political system and has, therefore, come out with several ad hoc crash programmes, such as the Crash Schemes for Rural Employment. Such programmes usually fritter away scarce investible resources and thus widen the resource-gap for developmental programmes. Apart from the growing concern with the problem of unemployment, the proliferation of such crash programmes owes very much to their political suitability for the elite. Unlike lumpy investments in projects like major and medium irrigation which are location-bound and which have a long gestation period, Rural Works Programmes offer the promise of immediate gain to a large number of people in wide areas. Secondly, these programmes help those in power to distribute patronage to a large number of middlemen who have to be rewarded and whose services need to be ensured for future.||C. H. Hanumantha Rao
