This paper endeavours to study the specific enclave features of the economy of the Brahmaputra valley arising out of the coexistence of these two sectors of differing nature - the traditional and the modern. It examines the system of land administration, the nature of land use before and after the inception of plantations, and the impact of this unequal ralationship on the regional agrarian economy and society.||Keya Dasgupta

The difference became sharper in the 1970s. Environmental and hygienic conditions are more favourable in Kerala, but the difference does not seem to be great enough to explain a significant part of the mortality differential. The empirical evidence from various surveys shows that the differences between the states in nutritional standard, per capita income, distribution of income and assets, industrialisation and urbanisation, cannot explain the lower mortality level in Kerala. The wider distribution of health facilities in the rural areas of Kerala and their greater utilisation are found to be significant factors. Two important reasons why the health facilities are used more in Kerala have been identified. First, the proportion of literates, particularly among females, is much higher in Kerala. Historically there has always been greater emphasis in Kerala on education and public health. Secondly, the rural poor in Kerala are more aware of their rights to use health and other public facilities than those in West Bengal. The differential awareness can be traced to the historical difference in the social and political movements in the two states. In general, West Bengal has always been characterised by a higher level of economic development and Kerala by a higher level of social development. The lower mortality level in Kerala can be attributed mostly to its higher social development and partly to its favourable environmental and hygienic conditions.||Moni Nag

There is indeed a need for developing a composite yardstick for the estimation of undernutrition taking all these factors into consideration.||C. Gopalan

This paper considers the present forest policy from the point of view of the forest dwellers themselves whose interests have to be primary in any formulation of a new forest policy. It begins with a brief account of the historical evolution of the official forest policy in India and the various changes that have been brought about in forest policy since Independence. It considers and criticises the provisions of the Indian Forest Bill, 1980, and proposes detailed guidelines for a new forest policy. Such a policy, the author argues, should aim, first, at maintaining ecological and environmental balance, second, at meeting the basic needs of the forest dwellers by way of food, fuel and shelter and, finally, at meeting also the needs of forest-based industries as well those of the urban population.||Sharad Kulkarni
