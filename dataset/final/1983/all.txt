In the US the Financial Accounting Standard (FAS)-33 requires supplementary disclosure both on constant dollar as well as current cost bases for all companies, including financial and banking companies. In view of the degree of monetisation and sophisticated banking habits of individuals as well as business organisations in Western economies, a set of proposals evolved for thee economies cannot be considered for implementation in India. The general apathy here towards developing suitable and consistent inflation-accounting standards bearing in mind the needs of business, banking and the national economy as a whole is, therefore, all the more regrettable. There is urgent need to set up a committee consisting of representatives from business, banking, government, accounting profession and academicians to evolve a refined system of inflation accounting suitable to the Indian economy.||C.

Thus, in a situation such as ours, a change of location of tax from the consumers' end to the production end benefits the class of traders and industrialists at the cost of consumers. A tax levied at the producers' end offers scope for legal evasion, whereas this scope does not exist in case of sales tax at the retailers' end.||Pradhan H. Prasad

For the strategies for accelerating regional development we first need to identify the basic problems preventing growth. The hill areas have remained 'backward' for historical reasons, and because of limitations imposed by their geophysical conditions. Nearly three-fourths of the land in hill areas belongs to the government. Policies regarding its use, as well as public expenditure to create infrastructure facilities, affect growth and distribution of income. Therefore, carefully chosen government policy can have a significant effect on the real incomes of the lowest income groups.||Mukul Sanwal

An integrated conceptual approach to micro-planning and to essential forestry, to meet these needs, is therefore called for. Part I of the paper, which appeared last week, underscored the role of planning at the micro-level, and took stock of the basic needs of the people and the materials and resources needed to fulfil these needs. It also specified the tree species for inclusion in essential forestry. Section V and VI of this concluding Part II, appearing this week, describe the agricultural and supportive animal systems, respectively, required by the micro-planning envisaged. Section VII covers the necessary energy resources, and Section VIII the income supplementation that may be necessary. The last, Section IX summarises certain conclusions.||Vinod K. Huria,K. T. Achaya

04/6/1983- ||special articles||4372186||Corporate Takeovers: The Indian Situation||The past few weeks have seen much hectic trading in the shares of Escorts and DCM, reflecting purchases of shares of these companies by non-resident Indians as also defensive operations by their present managements. While the threat of takeover of these two companies has receded, the issues raised by the Escorts-DCM episode transcend the immediate circumstances surrounding the attempted takeover. Indian industry, for long under family management and functioning in a sheltered economy, has been under pressure for a change in regard to both these sets of circumstances. While foreign competition may still be far off, conditions for ensuring domestic competition and greater efficiency and productivity within the domestic industrial sector have been often impeded by the type of management that characterises Indian industry. One of the first requisites for ensuring more competition and efficiency in the industrial sector, the author argues, is to facilitate conditions for change over of managements. Takeovers are an important route for accomplishing this. We, therefore, need an enabling machinery for handling corporate takeovers which avoid placing the financial institutions or the government in a decisive position. The machinery will have to be open and free from official intervention, subject only to a final review by government where takeovers affect the market structure and competition as envisaged under the MRTP Act. An attempt is made here to indicate the elements that would make up a satisfactory enabling system for handling of takeover bids.||S. Kumarasundaram

This article, while analysing colonial and post-colonial forest policies, concentrates on the historical process whereby the traditionally-held rights of the forest communities have been progressively curtailed through the development of forest policy, management and legislation. While the social imperatives behind forest policy have differed in the two periods under review - being the strategic interests of British imperialism before 1947 and after that the needs of the mercantile and industrial bourgeoisie - the impact on forest dwellers and their life-support systems has been a uniform one. The post-colonial state has taken over and further strengthened the organising principles of colonial forest administration - the assertion of state monopoly right and exclusion of forest communities. Section I of the paper deals with forestry in British India and Section II the post-colonial situation. Section III discusses the evolution of forest legislation. In Section IV are set out the author's conclusions. The paper is being published in two parts. Sections I and II were published last week, while the last two sections appear below.||Ramachandra Guha

29/1/1983- ||special article||4371804||Technology and Market Structure under Government Regulation: A Case Study of Indian Textile Industry||The promotion of small-scale production has been and continues to be an important element in Indian ideology and in government policy. The means adopted to promote it in the textile industry consisted of discrimination in the taxation and licensing against large mills and subsidies to small industry through Khadi and Village Industries Commission and through co-operatives. If we look at the country's cloth production as a whole, these policies have had little success in changing the technology mix, but they have had a strong influence, quite unrelated to policy objectives, on the firm size composition. They have prevented the growth of composite mills, and have led to the installation of most of the new looms in extremely small enterprises. Further, they have had a number of unintended and indeed little noticed effects. Under pressures created by them, the mill industry has improved its capital utilisation and the quality of its product, and endeavoured to meet the competition of the favoured powerlooms by means of product differentiation. It has met the competition of new enterprises with new and better equipment by means of small improvements in technology and product which have cumulatively added upto a substantial change. At the same time, however, it has produced less fine yarn than cotton supply permitted, and thereby reduced national cloth output below the potential. The developments in the textile industry have dictated the shape of the textile machinery industry. The small, new spinning mills and the even smaller weaving sheds have created a demad for cheap, simple and sturdy spinning and weaving equipment. The small improvements in the mills have required ancillary equipment such as high-draft systems, carding engines, and finishing machines. And the increase in frame speeds has raised the demand for high-wear goods like bearings. Hence the textile machinery industry has made a mainstay out of ancillaries and wearing items. While well aware of innovations being made abroad in the chief processes, the industry has, after having burnt its fingers on automatic looms in the 1960s, tended to specialise in old and tested equipment, waiting to bring in new technology until the domestic market clearly called for it.||Ashok V.

It aims at a political-economic interpretation of history based on the works of a few scholars who have dealt with the subject from a materialist standpoint. The author has attempted to synthesise the analyses and conjectures of these authors with a view to arriving at a comprehensive and consistent model of the economic structure of the Indus valley society with its dynamics.||Aparajita Chakraborty

Some Preliminary Considerations toward a Sociology of the Novel||Despite the fact that for the last two centuries the novel has been the predominant literary genre, the generic identity of the novel has not been established. The inadequacy of the existing formalist and sociological approaches to theorising about the novel arises from their inability to consider the novel a part of the dynamics of a literary system. The present paper discusses the Hegelian-Lukacsian model and Lucien Goldmann's sociological explanation of it and suggests that it is in the writings of Mikhail Bakhtin that one finds the sociology of the novel. Bakhtin, according to the author, provides an understanding of the systemic function of the novel and its unique relation to social reality.||Prabhakara Jha

This paper disputes this view and argues that Urban problems are related to the failure, even the irrelevance, of the dominant ideology of urban planning and housing programmes and can neither be blamed on growth of large cities nor on rural influx. On the contrary, the inequitable distribution of even those resources as are available to the city authorities and wrong urban and housing planning are the root cause of the urban problem. The argument is elucidated with reference to the growth of hutment dwellings in Pune.||Meera Bapat

In Section I, we give a general background of the districts, data pertaining to them, and various hypotheses which are to be tested with the help of the data. In Section II, we present a review of various investigations conducted by different researchers and their tentative conclusions on the subject. In Section III, results using regression equations are discussed. Some interesting inferences emerge, which are outlined in the concluding Section IV.||A. Parikh,S. Mosley

This paper endeavours to study the specific enclave features of the economy of the Brahmaputra valley arising out of the coexistence of these two sectors of differing nature - the traditional and the modern. It examines the system of land administration, the nature of land use before and after the inception of plantations, and the impact of this unequal ralationship on the regional agrarian economy and society.||Keya Dasgupta

It has been the fastest growing metropolis in the country in the last decade. This increase, however, is not evenly distributed over all the areas. The population of the city proper is outmigrating whereas the suburbs show an increase in density. While, on the face of it, this appears a welcome change, in fact it reflects the displacement of the middle and poorer income groups to more distant areas from place of work. This article argues that, with consciousness of the problems of crowding and unrest, outmigration from Greater Bombay is on the cards.||Malini Karkal

05/3/1983- ||special article||4371928||Development Programmes for the Poor: Do Strategies Make a Difference?||Special programmes for the 'weaker sections' of the population have found an important place in the Five-Year Plans since the Seventies. The increased plan allocations for these programmes were a response to the growing criticism that benefits of economic progress were not reaching the poor. The major promise of these programmes is that benefits will flow to the weaker sections because of the specificity of the target groups and of the activities chosen. The performance of the different programmes for the weaker sections, however, seems to have varied a great deal though their intentions were similar. This leads us to a significant question: under what conditions do benefits of development programmes flow to the weaker sections? The purpose of this paper is to address this issue in a preliminary fashion through an investigation of the experiences of eight programmes: (1) Small Farmers Development Agency, (2) Marginal Farmers and Agricultural Labourers Programme, (3) Antyodaya, (4) Drought Prone Areas Programme, (5) Crash Scheme for Rural Employment, (6) Employment Guarantee Scheme, (7) Food for Work, and (8) Operation Barga. While the primary focus of the paper is on these programmes, supplementary evidence from the experience of other programmes related to those under review is also presented and, where directly relevant, lessons from the positive or negative effect of changes in other programmes are discussed.||Samuel Paul,Ashok Subramanian

Most of the fertiliser promotion campaigns in developing countries, moreover are designed to carry the message to the farmers, that the present level of application of fertilisers in their fields is only a small fraction of the optimum level or is very insignificant compared to the levels on Japanese and Korean farms. But the real issue in the developing countries is not 'how much' fertiliser is applied to the soil, as how efficiently even the existing level of fertiliser is used. This paper analyses this problem in the Indian context, which may be relevent to many other developing countries also.||A. P. Srivastava

The rise in labour-income and labour-share is also largely explained by increase in the agricultural labour population which increased labour-intensity of production. The increase in labour-intensity may be taken as a signal of the dampening of growth of capitalism in agriculture. The small increase in real wage levels that is perceptible despite the sharp increase in the supply of agricultural labour is due to the absence of concentration of enterprise in the hands of a small number of big farms.||G C Mandal

Therefore to find out entirely new explanations for them would be to ignore the traditional structure and process of change affecting that structure. The new issues are land reforms, green revolution, adult franchise, and some other such structural innovations, but the explanations to understand them are mainly traditional ones: caste, family background, regional affinity and language have always played a crucial role in the traditionalisation of these post-Independence devices.

The issues thrown up by the Report are accordingly divided into four groups in this paper. The first section seeks to clarify some aspects of the CSO methods of estimating net domestic product, saving and investment, and to set right the impression created by the Working Group's observations on the relations between, and the relative reliability of, the different measures of these magnitudes. The second section deals with some important omissions of the Report in respect of the types of bias inherent in the CSO procedure. This section is really an adjunct of the first in that the commissions and omissions covered in these two sections emanate from the same source, viz, a superficial understanding of the CSO method. The next two sections examine problems and issues whose importance is of a more general nature and extends beyond the inadequacies specific to the framework adopted by the CSO. The third section attempts to throw light on some conceptual confusions of the Report, and to suggest ways out of the veritable cul-de-sac which it often wanders into. In the fourth section we examine the Working Group's interpretation of some macro features of the Indian economy, and indicate how and why its approach and major conclusions run contrary to economic logic.||Mihir Rakshit

17/12/1983- ||special articles||4372796||Non-Maximising Behaviour of Farmers: Paddy Sales||Standard economic theory treats the Economic Man as a maximising agent. The universal assumption - common to neo-classical and Marxian economics - is that a producer or seller is a maximiser of short-run profit. A close look at the decisions taken by farmers in India, however, suggests that they are guided by considerations other than maximisation of short-run profit. The author has investigated two important decisions every farmer has to take. The first relates to the crop combination selected by him for cultivation and the second to the time of sale of the saleable part of his harvest. Profit maximisation would, in the first case, make the farmer cultivate only such crops as, subject to probabilities, promise to yield the maximum profit in production. In the second case, the guiding principle would make him sell all his marketable surplus of a crop at the maximum price fetched by the crop. In actual fact, farmers cultivate a whole range of crops, obviously not all profit maximising, and they sell their crops in several instalments, spread over the time between two successive harvests. This paper discusses the apparently 'irrational' behaviour of farmers in regard to the pattern of sales of the principal crop, paddy, over time. In two earlier papers published in this journal the author has dealt with crop selection by farmers and with the time-pattern of sales of crops other than paddy.||Ashok Rudra

The most fundamental, and the only, feature that reserves the official policy as contained in the Sixth Plan pertains to the import of goods, services, foreign capital and foreign technology. In any case, the policy package undertaken together would seriously inhibit prospects of India's economic growth in the long run.||Ranjit Sau
19/3/1983- ||special articles||4371982||Some Macro-Economic Propositions around Current Budgetary Policy||The essential feature of the current budgetary policy consists in the following: raising substantial additional resources through indirect taxation, of which the freight, price and duty hikes are but specific examples, for investment in a few key areas, notably energy, while attempting to keep the budget deficit within reasonable bounds that would also not be too offensive to the IMF. In this paper the author discusses not so much the details of this year's budget proposals as certain macro-economic implications of this overall budgetary policy, which surprisingly have drawn rather less attention than they should have. The current budgetary policy, it is argued, is one which not only encourages tax-push-inflation-cum-recession, but also undermines the financial position of the states with serious long-term repercussions, without at the same time being particularly successful in reducing either the current account deficit or the overall budgetary deficit of the Centre and the states taken together.||Prabhat Patnaik

If this claim is intended to create the impression that the long-run rate of growth of the economy has accelerated, it is grossly misleading. For the kind of acceleration recorded in the last three years can be shown to have occurred in every three-year period after a year of negative growth. The Mid-Term Appraisal also suggests that public sector investment exceeded the target in the first three years of the Sixth Plan. Actually, the deflated public investment over the three years adds up to 44 per cent of the five-year target. Therefore, unless there is a notable step up in investment in the last two years, the short-fall of real Plan outlay in the Sixth Plan will be larger than in any earlier Plan. As regards poverty, an unprecedented claim has been made by the Planning Commission in the Mid-Term Appraisal. If the Appraisal's figures of the number of people raised above the poverty line are true, an astonishing rate of reduction of India's mass poverty would seem to have been suddenly and almost miraculously achieved with the beginning of the Sixth Plan. Unfortunately, the Appraisal's calculations have no valid basis whatsoever.||Raj Krishna

It is one of the 'South Indian Villages' surveyed originally by Gilbert Slater and his students in 1916, with this village being the initial one surveyed by Slater personally. Two further resurveys took place in 1937 and in 1961. The main themes of the resurvey are change and continuity in the last 65 years in living conditions, technology, landownership and the village power structure as can be pieced together from the earlier evidence and the present investigation. The paper is published in two parts. In the first part, we deal with demographic factors, education, health and water supply. We move on then to the village economy and discuss costs and returns in paddy cultivation based on pumpset irrigation and the new technology, a feature of the 1960s and 1970s.||S. Guhan,Joan P.

The last named came into existence in 1960. A study of the tenancy arrangement in this frontier region, characterised by a large-scale peasant mobilisation and revolt which occurred a decade and a half ago, is the object of this paper. The results of the study are presented in sections III to VI. Section III deals with the distinct land tenure structure in Intersection and Non-intersection villages - 'intersection' denoting the intersection of both the mass movement and the coexistence of a credit, land and labour market. Section IV contains an analysis of the types of tenurial arrangements in these two types of villages. Section V examines the role of credit in tenurial contracts. Thelast section, VI, in the light of the foregoing analysis, ventures some views on the tenurial contracts of the region under study.||Manabendu Chattopadhyay,Sumit Kumar Ghosh

Given the size of likely demands on government finances, how does the Budget attempt to raise additional resources? Does the Budget aim at any improvement or rationalisation of the prevailing modes of resource mobilisation, especially taxes? This second question is important from the stand-point of raising revenue too, since the Sixth Plan expected to concentrate the major thrust of the tax effort on rationalisation of the tax system and improvement of tax administration, in addition to selective additional taxation. It is to a discussion of these aspects of the 1983-84 Budget that this paper is devoted.||I. S. Gulati

In a society where bourgeois values have high prestige, the acceptance of such values by a few members of oppressed groups can hardly be seen as a sign of regression, unless we insist on ignoring the point of view from which the oppressed would look at their own successful brethren. What we should be worried about is not the fate of this tiny minority, but that of the vast numbers of SC and ST children who stop going to school long before the carrot of a middle class job can appear before them, and whose brief and demeaning educational experience merely proves to them that they are what they were alleged to be. The experience of education, under prevailing curricular norms, serves to assist SC and ST children to internalise the symbols of 'backward' behaviour.||Krishna Kumar

30/7/1983- ||special article||4372362||Theories of City Size Distribution and Indian Urban Structure: A Reappraisal||Computation of urban growth for the six size categories, using their respective population from different censuses, when the towns in these categories vary widely at different points of time, has created a false alarm regarding the high growth of large towns in India. However, the quick calculations attempted by scholars claiming to correct this flaw and to establish an absence of size-growth relationship, does not seem to be free from methodological or other errors. The present paper obtains the growth rates for different size class of towns taking the towns that belonged to each class in the base year. The growth rate of class I towns works out as consistently higher than those of lower categories. It is further shown that the percentage of towns registering more than sixty per cent decadal growth is much higher in the case of the top category. The disparity in the growth rate is also low for towns of this category, which has further gone down in the seventies suggesting strengthening of their economic base. The declassification of a larger number of small towns, high variation in their growth rates, a smaller percentage of the towns registering a growth rate higher than sixty per cent, etc, on the other hand, are indications of their unstable economy. The differences in the pace and pattern of growth at the two levels of urban hierarchy seems to be a reflection, in space, of the dual structure of the Indian economy.||Amitabh Kundu

We have, first, factors like distribution of land which directly affect the income of cultivating households and, second, factors, like rural wage rates and wage employment which affect mainly the income of rural labour households. The following analysis deals with the third set of factors, agricultural prices and production, which affect the incomes of both segments of the rural poor directly. The reference period is 1963-64 to 1973-74, beginning before the so-called Green Revolution and extending well into that phase, so that the results reflect the forces that have come into play during this period of agricultural growth.||Sudipto Mundle

Income-tax payers who, since they enjoy relatively large incomes. are capable of taking some risk are offered rwards for taking no risk and keeping away from any venturesome activities. Thus this type of tax relief is actually prejudicial to economic growth and social justice. Tax exemptions in respect of long-term savings should be so structured as to canalise savings into investments carrying greater risk. The author offers some suggestions as to how this can be done.||M. P. Chitale

The problem, it is argued here, is not so much that agricultural growth has not kept pace with population growth but rather that in the post-colonial economies of Asia gains in agricultural productivity have been largely offset by excessive absorption of labour in agriculture. This in turn has led, via rigidities in the cost of food and fibre production, to high costs and market constraints for manufacturing industry as a whole. This structure of constraints, is one of the basic long-term consequences of colonial policy which retarded industrial growth at a crucial stage of development of these former colonies. The argument is illustrated with a comparison of the experience of Japan with that of two former colonial economies, Java and India.||Sudipto Mundle

26/2/1983- ||special article||4371902||Energy Policies in Brazil||The 'modernisation' of Brazil which took place after 1950 has been synonymous with the adoption of a 'petroleum-based economy'. Since Brazil has meagre petroleum resources, the foreign exchange to pay for imported oil became a fundamental problem, and a policy of heavy borrowing abroad was adopted as the solution. As heavy borrowing abroad continued, Brazil's foreign debt climbed to more than 50 billion dollars which, together with the high interest rates for debt servicing, threatened to lead the country to bankruptcy. This extremely serious situation was sufficiently well understood by the elites in Brazil, who were thus convinced of the need to adopt alternative solutions and to enact energy programmes that were and are innovative. A two-pronged strategy was followed: (i) reducing the consumption of petroleum derivatives through pricing, and (ii) producing large quantities of a new fuel (ethanol) from biomass (obtained from sugarcane), i e, substituting fossil fuels by renewable fuels. The strategy was based on the use of the agricultural sector to solve problems in the industrial and transportation sectors. Even if not applicable in detail to other countries, this strategy indicates the possibility of synergisms between these sectors. The Brazilian government has also shown a remarkable flexibility in facing the energy crisis. More than constituting an attempt to solve the energy crisis, this is a case study of the way 'elites' can be responsive to new ideas when their interests are at stake, even if these new ideas do not originate from the government.||Jose Goldemberg

This note focuses on only a few aspects of the Budget, in particular on two of its flaws. These are of different kinds. By looking at the trade policies - objective (b) above - the author illustrates the problem of yielding too much to the indigenous business lobby.

The first concerns a comparison between countries at various stages of development, while the second relates to differences between poor and rich families within poor countries. There is some confusion in the literature on fertility in relation to levels of living and development, which can be traced to a mixing up of these two-macro and micro-aspects of the relationship. Why do birth rates in poor countries tend to be high? This is a social (or macro) question, but since children are born within families, the answers are sought for in family behaviour. It is not surprising therefore that theories of fertility are micro theories based on family attitudes, etc. Do the poor produce more children per couple than do the rich? The question which theory investigates-why do the poor produce more children?-arises only if the answer to the previous question is in the affirmative. There are masses of data which help us to give an answer. But perhaps due to their abundance, the data are full of ambiguity and seem to have been misinterpreted.||N. Krishnaji

Competition and conflict among interest groups have quickened and the Congress party organisation, which had been the central political institution, the instrument for conflict management, has crumbled. How great an impact have these political developments had upon Indian life in general? In many other developing countries (and in some industrialised nations too), similar or less severe political difficulties have produced more general crises. In India this has not happened and seems, at least at first glance, unlikely to happen soon. Is that an accurate impression? A great deal of research needs to be done before we will be able to answer these questions with any adequacy. What follows is an attempt to set out a framework for discussion which will probably need amending.||James Manor

In fact, because of rising prices of vegetable oils, animal tallows have emerged as an essential industrial raw material. The composition of tallow imports has itself been affected by price differentials between beef and mutton tallows, the cheaper of the two gaining the larger market share from time to time. Use of animal tallows for adulteration could have been prevented if the 'actual user' condition governing the import of tallows had been strictly enforced by the Ministry of Commerce. Imports against OGL, REP, Advance/Imprest licences are also governed by the actual user condition and/or export obligation. Had these conditions been enforced and even a single offender prosecuted, misuse of imported tallows under an otherwise sound policy could not have taken. What is at fault is not the policy but its administration. The government's action in banning import of tallows is unwise as this will lead to rise in prices of both edible oils and soaps. Import of tallows for use in manufacture of soap, grease, etc, must be continued till substitute raw materials are available.||Ram Khanna

01/10/1983- ||special articles||4372556||Non-Maximising Behaviour of Farmers: Crop Selection||Standard economic theory treats the Economic Man as a maximising agent. The universal assumption is that a producer or seller is a maximiser of short-run profit and this is common to neo-classical and Marxian economics. A close look at the decisions taken by farmers in India, however, suggests that they are guided by considerations other than maximisation of short-run profit. The author investigates two important decisions every farmer has to take. The first relates to the crop combination selected by him for cultivation and the second to the time of sale of the saleable part of his harvest. Profit maximisation would, in the first case, make the farmer cultivate only such crops as, subject to probabilities, promise to yield the maximum profit in production. In the second case, the guiding principle would make him sell all his marketable surplus of a crop at the maximum price fetched by the crop. In actual fact farmers cultivate a whole range of crops, obviously not all profit maximising, and they sell their crops in several instalments spread over the time between two successive harvests. This paper presents the results of the author's investigation of crop selection by farmers.||Ashok Rudra

Though the Act provides a definition of 'industry' in Section 2(j), the definition is not very precise and has defied consistent interpretation. As a result, judicial effort has been directed at evolving tests by reference to characteristics regarded as essential for regarding an activity as an 'industry'. The cases decided by the courts, however, show that these tests have not been uniform. The courts have been guided by an empirical rather than a strictly analytical approach: sometimes the tests have been liberally conceived, at other times narrowly. The Industrial Disputes (Amendment) Bill, 1982 seeks to put an end to the floating state of the definition of 'industry'. In the process it has narrowed the concept of 'industry' and opened up a debate on the curtailment of the benefits and protection available to employees under the earlier definition.||K. K. Chaudhuri

30/7/1983- ||review of political economy, july 1983||4372359||Internationalisation of Capital, Neo-Colonialism and International Finance||International finance capital has been the crucial force behind the functioning and development of the world capitalist system since the last decade of the 19th century. A distinctive feature of international finance capital has been its concentration in the hands of a few, whether they be banks or industries. It is important to understand the financial oligarchy controlling this system, as it also influences to a considerable extent the policies of the state in the various countries. In the present paper, three aspects of present-day international finance have been touched upon: First, the economic relations among the relatively powerful nations, comprising both mutuality of interest as well as rivalry. Second, the close control of international financial bodies by nations which are economically stronger. Third, the implications of these two aspects for the poor nations of the world. Section I contains a review of related literature. Section II interprets the current inter-relations among capitalist states. Section III points to the inequities in the functioning of the major international financial institutions. And Section IV analyses the experience of the non-oil developing countries in conditions of international inequity.||Sunanda Sen

This paper presents evidence which bears upon the problem of price distortion, but from a different standpoint. Instead of using tariffs and scarcity premia to measure price distortions, we use comparative price information for commodities at disaggregated levels in India and in India's international trade. The results suggest that tariffs and quantitative restrictions in general have no major distortional effects in India.||R. G. Nambiar

05/11/1983-12/11/1983||special articles||4372675||Poverty in the Mid-Term Appraisal||Progressive reduction in the incidence of poverty is one of the major objectives of the Sixth Five-Year Plan. In his foreword to the Mid-Term Appraisal of the Plan, which was placed before the Parliament in August, the Minister of Planning claims: "A close and detailed evaluation has been made of the performance so far and the prospects for the remaining years of the Plan." This paper argues that this claim is not at all valid with reference to the poverty reduction objective. On the contrary, the assessment in this connection for the first two years of the Plan is extremely brief and unclear and is marked by utter casualness to the point of being misleading. And there is absolutely no discussion of the prospects for the remaining years of the Plan. Parliament and the nation, it appears, have been taken for a ride. The casual treatment by the Mid-Term Appraisal of this supposedly important subject suggests that other parts of this document cannot be uncritically accepted without close scrutiny. This is important because statements appearing in such documents have a tendency to acquire unwarranted and uncritical sanctity. Moreover, if the claims of poverty reduction in the Mid-Term Appraisal are indicative of any trend, we might well expect further reductions or even eradication of poverty by redefining poverty itself.||K.

It discusses the level and determinants of investment within the rural sector as well as the flow of resources to and from the sector in the form of financial liabilities and assets. Rural aggregates have been broken up, as far as possible, to provide estimates for agricultural and nonagricultural households. Separate study of savings behaviour of agricultural households is important, both for understanding the dynamics of Indian agriculture and for situating the Indian experience in the debate on agriculture's resource contribution in the initial stages of industrialisation. Separate treatment of agriculture is required because, despite agriculture's dominance, rural aggregates sometimes give a picture very different from that relating only to agricultural households. The main theme that emerges is that there is no clear evidence of an increase in rural or agricultural savings rates, but there is considerable evidence of a change in the pattern of savings, i e, in asset preference. There have been shifts in preference between financial and physical assets, and also between the components of both groups of assets.||Ashoka Mody

06/8/1983- ||special articles||4372385||De-Collectivisation of Agriculture in China, 1979-82: A Long-Term Perspective||It is in agriculture that the most far-reaching changes have occurred in China's political economy over the past three or four years. Fundamental institutional reform has taken place amounting to a 'de-collectivisation' of the peasantry comparable in importance to the 'collectivisation' in the mid-1950s. A cornerstone of the 'Maoist model' of development was the rural collective structure. It appeared to many outside observers that China under Mao had been remarkably successful in evolving farm institutions that were capable of attaining rapid farm modernisation with a lower degree of inequality than existed in capitalist settings. Do China's recent agricultural reforms lead to the conclusion that this enthusiasm was based on misconceptions of the reality of China's farm sector under Mao? Do they reinforce the view that collective farms do not provide a viable alternative to private ownership for farm modernisation? To begin to answer such questions it is necessary to ex-examine the record of China's agricultural collectives and establish the reasons behind 'de-collectivisation'. It is to this task that this paper is addressed. Section II of the paper summarises the principal stages of rural institutional change from the revolution to the present. Section III examines some of the problems with the methods of rural work organisation and income distribution in the 1960s and 1970s. Section IV looks at policies on rural capital formation and resource allocation. Section V assesses the performances of the collectives in terms of farm output, and peasant income and consumption. Section VI attempts to draw together the threads of the analysis into an explanation of the re-organisation of the past three years. This paper is published in two parts. The first four sections of the paper appears below and sections V and VI will be published next week.||Peter Nolan

Since high growth districts are the predominant users of available tractors and tubewells (and other inputs) in the country, capital intensity per worker is the main determinant of labour productivity in these districts. Fixed capital alone is important, but the addition of variables like gross cropped area and fertilisers results in significant increase in the explanation of variation in labour productivity. This neat relationship, however, gets watered down for the medium, low and to some extent negative growth districts. In traditional agriculture, investment in modern equipment like tractors and tubewells is quite limited and even the working capital requirements are quite low. In these conditions labour productivity depends more on fluctuating output determined by vagaries of monsoons than on quantum of fixed and variable capital.||G. S. Bhalla,Y. K. Alagh

Given the nature of Orwell's own commitment and contribution to those certainties, this critical attempt is, implicitly and sometimes explicitly, a critique of those certainties. It is also, ineluctably, an exploration of the possibilty of a politico-literary criticism. The subject of 'colonial fictions' deserves a much fuller treatment. The author has used colonial fictions merely as a critical 'pretext' for advancing a larger argument about Orwell.||Alok Rai

The report reviews the economic performance of the concerned countries, particularly during the last two decades, diagnoses the root causes of stagnation and decline, and unequivocally recommends a certain course of action for the short and the long term. The World Bank's analysis of the recent record of sub-Saharan economies as well as its suggested strategy are important not only for that poorest part of the world but for the entire Third World. For the Bank has been following this particular line of analysis elsewhere as well, and making very similar pronouncements on economic policies. In addition, the Bank's report raises a few issues of theoretical significance that would bear further scrutiny. In this paper the author first presents a summary of the sub-Saharan economic performance during the last two decades, as set out in the Bank's report. He next describes the main elements of the agenda of action proposed by the Bank: All this is then critically examined. Finally, some observations are made on the pattern of economic development in a country with a limited supply of foodgrains, which seems to be a more appropriate characterisation of sub-Saharan Africa and much else of the Third World, than what is portrayed in, for instance, W Arthur Lewis' model of economic development with an unlimited supply of labour.||Ranjit Sau

It appears that garden-land crops (particularly coconut) have been gaining at the expense of wet-land crops (particularly paddy). Crop area data are, as discussed by the author, inadequate in some respects, but the broad conclusion of a shift in cropping pattern holds even when the data inadequacies are accounted for. Also examined are the technical possibilities of substitution of coconut on paddy-growing lands. The paper is divided into three sections. Changes in rice area are discussed in Section I and it is established that area under rice has fallen in recent years. Section II discusses changes in area under coconut, and juxtaposes these with the changes in area under rice. Finally, Section III discusses possibilities of substitution of coconut for rice.||Jeemol Unni

26/3/1983- ||review of agriculture, march 1983||4372005||Determinants of Fertiliser Use in Indian Agriculture||This paper develops a framework for the analysis of factors affecting fertiliser use in Indian Agriculture. Existing studies are unable to explain the deceleration in fertiliser use and the growing divergence between targets and actual levels of consumption. The paper then tries to explain the variations in fertiliser use [over regions and over time] in terms of a set of physical/technological factors and of relative price, using regression and correlation analysis. It suggests that irrigation is uniformly a dominant influence - especially groundwater. Spread of HYVs and fertiliser-intensive crops (notably those under irrigated area) are found to have a positive effect on fertiliser consumption. Use of fertilisers and relative price, as expected, are inversely related, but the relation is very weak. While most of the observed increase in fertiliser consumption over time can be 'explained' by these variables, they do not help understand why fertiliser consumption has decelerated. The deceleration has happened despite rapid growth of irrigation facilities and qualitative improvement in water supply (due to a phenomenal growth of energised wells and a rise in share of groundwater) and spread of HYVs. Hence a set of hypotheses are outlined, based on our theoretical analysis of the problem. An enquiry into these hypotheses perhaps would prove fruitful.||R. Nagaraj

The Finance Minister says he is promoting savings; rather what he should promote is investment. On the other hand, the Budget is faithful to the letter and spirit of the Government of India's Memorandum to the IMF in connection with the SDR 5 billion loan. The author examines the Budget in the light of the major areas of shift in policy identified in the Memorandum and concludes that it falls in a well-defined structural pattern from which it might be difficult to extricate the Indian economy in the near future.||Ranjit Sau

The destruction of the Somoza dictatorship at the hands of a unified, broad-based popular movement came at a time when imperialism, weakened by the debacle in Indochina, found itself incapable of decisive intervention. In the wake of the Nicaraguan revolution, both the Carter and the Reagan administrations were - with differences in approach, in style and in rhetoric - to seek to reverse the situation and to reassert Washington's control over a region traditionally regarded as its 'back yard'. The experience of the past six years suggests, however, that there can be no easy return to the interventionist and counter-revolutionary solutions that imperialism has always taken for granted. This paper will examine the experience of the two administrations, set against the history of US interference in the affairs of this small Central American nation.||Susan Ram
09/4/1983- ||special articles||4372069||Origins and Development of Hindu Mahasabha Ideology: The Call of V D Savarkar and Bhai Parmanand||The early work of both Bhai Parmanand and Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. Hindu Mahasabha leaders of all India standing from the Punjab and Bombay Presidency, not merely glorified some periods of Indian history prior to the arrival of the British which, in their view, presented instances of Hindu-Muslim unity against the alien conqueror but also suggested that such unity was still possible. In course of time, however, both Parmanand and Savarkar became leading proponents of militant Hinduism and of particularist and even exclusivist concept of Hindu nationhood. This paper, an attempt to trace the ideological origins and development of Hindu Mahasabha, considers the events and circumstances (as well as the prejudices and material interests) that marked (and influenced) this transition of Parmanand and Savarkar from being protagonists of Hindu-Muslim unity to being the ideologues of Hindutva.||T.

24/9/1983- ||special article||4372536||Sex Inequalities in the Dual System of Education: The Parsis of Gujarat||This paper presents findings on sex inequalities in school envolment and educational opportunities in the dual system of education, vernacular (Gujarati) and English, among 551 Parsi households in Gujarat. The survey sample involved both rural and urban populations to isolate the effects of urbanisation as a factor in educational development. Detailed interviewing techniques with a family-centred focus facilitated the application of control variables such as rural/urban, age, years of education and medium of instruction, plus family characteristics such as household income and parents' medium of instruction and years of schooling, to determine the effects of sex on types of education which were received by school-age persons. The results revealed some surprising findings which are contrary to the stereotypical view of the Parsis, which are also shared by community members, and by South Asianists, that there is no sex discrimination in the provision of educational opportunities to the children. On the positive side, again contrary to expectations, the data showed that among the rural population, there is a strong effect of even the mothers' meagre education (6.6 years) and medium of instruction (English) in affecting the daughters' opportunities to study in the elite English medium schools.||Ketayun Gould

The study concludes that the distribution of elementary education, in its stock form as well as in its current flow pattern, is clearly equitable, secondary education is fairly equitable and higher education is a monotonically increasing function of incomes. The same is more or less true with respect to the distribution of public expenditure on education. The study also highlights rural-urban differences.||Ajit K. Dasgupta,Jandhyala B. G. Tilak

An ambitious effort had made in the Planning Commission to start the work of annual forecasting, but it seems to have been given up. The budget contains, as one of its components, a 'Plan Budget' and a table is given about the broad allocations of state plans in the document 'Budget at a Glance'. There is a danger that such fragmentary information put together may give only a rather partial and somewhat distorted picture of the Plan, but the risk is worth taking.||D. T. Lakdawala

1/5/1983- ||literature of politics||4372133||From Politics to Literature: A Consideration of Jonathan Swift and George Orwell||Since its origins in the seventeenth century English Revolution, political journalism in England has not only had a significant impact on the growth of modern English political institutions but has also influenced the development of English literary culture. This has been a process of mutual benefit and enrichment. Political journalism, which functions as a branch of rhetoric in that its aim is to persuade, draws on the traditional resources of literature like irony and satire to achieve its effects. At the same time, being also an attempt at objective reportage of contemporary social reality, political journalism helps to widen the scope of creative literature by introducting elements into it which had earlier been outside its purview. This paper attempts to study the close connection, and at times even creative fusion, between political journalism and creative literature by bringing together two representative artist-journalists, Jonathan Swift (1667-1745) and George Orwell (1903-50), from among the many that literary history has to offer, for comparison and contrast of their works both as to the content and the methods of their art and reportage.||Aparna Mahanta

The difference became sharper in the 1970s. Environmental and hygienic conditions are more favourable in Kerala, but the difference does not seem to be great enough to explain a significant part of the mortality differential. The empirical evidence from various surveys shows that the differences between the states in nutritional standard, per capita income, distribution of income and assets, industrialisation and urbanisation, cannot explain the lower mortality level in Kerala. The wider distribution of health facilities in the rural areas of Kerala and their greater utilisation are found to be significant factors. Two important reasons why the health facilities are used more in Kerala have been identified. First, the proportion of literates, particularly among females, is much higher in Kerala. Historically there has always been greater emphasis in Kerala on education and public health. Secondly, the rural poor in Kerala are more aware of their rights to use health and other public facilities than those in West Bengal. The differential awareness can be traced to the historical difference in the social and political movements in the two states. In general, West Bengal has always been characterised by a higher level of economic development and Kerala by a higher level of social development. The lower mortality level in Kerala can be attributed mostly to its higher social development and partly to its favourable environmental and hygienic conditions.||Moni Nag

The Study Group was expected, firstly, to study the factors influencing corporate investment and, secondly, to suggest, after assessment of the sources of funds in the private corporate sector, the manner in which resources for the desired level of investment, as contemplated in the Sixth Plan, could be raised. The purpose of this note is to assess the methodology adopted by the Study Group to make the revised estimates of investment by the private corporate sector for the period 1982-83 to 1984-85 and of individual sources of financing the estimated investment. It also evaluates some of the specific recommendations made to stimulate resource mobilisation efforts of the private corporate sector.||Vinay D. Lall

A woman in poverty has low access to cooking fuel, spends the longest time obtaining it, and puts it to use in stoves which are not only fuel-inefficient, but which also subject her to serious or fatal disease. Cooking energy also increasingly determines a woman's nutrition level, and that of her family. It is, therefore, essential that all innovations in the cooking energy system be undertaken only in continuous interaction with the women whose lives they will most affect. This interaction must be initiated at the idealconceptual stage, and not when the prototype is ready for testing.||Srilatha Batliwala

19/3/1983- ||special articles||4371987||Corporate and Personal Income Taxes: Economic Issues and Policy Alternatives||The Finance Minister fortunately, has not made any fundamental structural changes in the system of direct taxation of income. Such a change should not be made through the annual Budget but through the replacement of the Income-tax Act, 1961, which is now over two decades old and has become a complicated and unworkable piece of legislation. The replacement of the income-tax law should, however, be preceded by a detailed assessment of the shortcomings of the existing legislation, with quantitative evidence, to the extent possible, on its operative effects and also an evaluation of the likely effects proposed alternatives. The minor surgeries that the Finance Minister has attempted in the 1983-84 Budget has many positive elements, though it seems that the economic implications of all proposed measures were not given adequate consideration. This paper attempts to assess some of the economic implications of major changes proposed in the system of direct taxation of income and to identify areas in which changes remain to be made to make the income-tax law workable and appropriate in the present-day context.||Vinay D.

27/8/1983- ||special articles||4372456||Handlooms Face Liquidation: Powerlooms Mock at Yojana Bhavan||A substantial portion of powerloom production of cloth, it is well known, is shown as handloom production. This is not an innocent error; it is a smoke-screen for concealing the cannibalisation of handlooms by powerlooms. The resultant loss of employment in weavers' households is unimaginable; and one-half of those who lose their jobs are women since women engage in pre-weaving processes and, in certain areas, in weaving as well. The hands of the Textile Commissioner's organisation, which knowingly puts out fictitious estimates of production in the powerloom and the handloom sectors, are not clean. The record of the Planning Commission is worse since it continues to reproduce figures put out by the Textile Commissioner despite the fact that more than one official, high-powered study, including one conducted within the Planning Commission, has exposed the falsehood of these statistics. In the face of the systematic destruction of handlooms, it is not easy to put faith in the Sixth Plan's claims that it regards employment as India's critical problem and the consumer goods sector as one of the most eligible areas for traditional labour-intensive techniques of production. If the number of those below the poverty line in the country is growing, a major culprit is thoughtless, cruel and unwarranted mechanisation.||L. C. Jain

A quick field investigation conducted in Gujarat revealed that a substantial portion of women's working time and energy is devoted to such tasks. Among the poorer households, difficulties in collecting firewood and fuel are on the increase, increasing women's drudgery. People seem to be caught between a process of immiserisation caused by increasing pressure on scarce resources (and their poor command of the resources to begin with), on the one hand, and the process of development which has led to valuable alternative uses for resources so far considered waste (and available to them free of cost), on the other. Thus, the increasing drudgery of rural women is an inseparable part of their overall deepening poverty in the rural areas.||D. Nagbrahmam,Shreekant Sambrani

This paper examines the economic aspects of this revolution. So far no outsiders worth the name are involved in this transformation, either in the formation of the new economic basis or of the new social order, except through the agency of the state. And the state structure itself at the top and its legislative wing are completely manned by representatives of the local people. Has the traditional tribal economic basis disintegrated? Far from that, it is still predominant. But most of its production relations including exchange and distribution relations are now coloured by shades of the new, emergent economic basis. It may take a long time, generations perhaps, before the old mode of production completely disappears. It all depends upon whether or not the institutions and principles, such as common property in land, distribution according to need and reciprocity, on which the tribal solidarity stood are consciously preserved and strengthened.||S.

The knowledge and insights required for the latter task can result only from studies of organisations in the course of their normal day-to-day functioning. This is a study of labour-management relations in the banking industry under normal working conditions. The author's measure of labour-management relations is based on the perceptions of the supervisory staff who are placed in the middle of the organisational hierarchy between labour and management. The study seeks to examine the influence of certain aspects of organisational culture, structure, and processes upon the climate of labour-management relations. The respondents were asked to evaluate, first, the climate of labour-management relations, and then, the various aspects of culture, structure, and processes of their respective banks.||Baldev R.

Accounting now needs to undergo yet another change to adapt itself to the changed economic environment of price instability and rapid developments in technology. The change that is being suggested is a modification to the existing accounting practice of reporting only historical cost information. Current cost information on the activity of the enterprise is necessary for meaningful decision making by the user of the financial statement. In India, the initiative has to come from the government because of the strong linkage between the accounting system and the regulatory framework of the government. The accounting profession and industry too need to strongly express the need for inflattion adjusted accounts.||J. Ramachandran

The author finds that the phenomenon of banks' sanctioned credit limits exceeding their deposits has perhaps disappeared and this phenomenon cannot be attributed to the existence and predominance of the cash credit system of bank lending. There has been an improvement in the utilisation of sanctioned credit limits. The importance of the cash credit system has not at all declined and there has not been any progress in the use of bill finance system. No noticeable and consistent decline in inventory levels has occurred, and while norms have beenwell implemented in respect of finished goods inventories, they have been only partially implemented in respect of raw materials inventories and receivables. The ratio of bank borrowings to inventories has tended to increase rather than decrease and the actual level of bank finance for working capital requirements has tended to exceed the maximum permissible bank borrowings under method II. Finally, the quarterly budgeting system has mostly been unimplemented by banks and their customers.||L M Bhole

15/1/1983- ||special articles||4371753||Agricultural Growth in China and India: Role of Price and Non-Price Factors||The increase in agricultural production achieved in China in the 1950s was based largely on the restoration and fuller utilisation of the traditional infrastructure of irrigation located largely, in the south. With the relatively high yield levels already achieved during this period and the very limited scope for extension of cultivated area, the only way of maintaining adequate rates of growth and correcting the regional imbalances was through large-scale investment for increasing further the area under irrigation (particularly in the north). Apart from the ideological considerations generally mentioned, a major reason for the far-reaching organisational changes introduceed from the early 1960s through the commune system was, therefore, essentially to mobilise rural labour on the necessary scale for undertaking such investment and for other related activities. The resumption of high rates of growth in agricultural production in China from 1970 can in fact be attributed to the substantial infrastructure that was built up in the course of the 1960s through investment in water and soil conservation (as well as in chemical fertilisers) The role of prices was, however, underrated and even neglected during this period. Apart from the possible failure to raise foodgrain and other prices selectively and by slow stages, there was clearly a strong tendency to assume that the opportunity cost of peasant labour was equal to or very close to zero. This in all probability is the main explanation for the changes in agrarian policy, in regard to both organisation and prices, that have been taking place in recent years in China. But the large-scale investment activity in agriculture which the organisational innovations made possible was an important and even indispensable phase in its development. Prices and other material incentives can evoke substantial increases in output only after the other constraints have been effectively relaxed.||K. N. Raj

Ataullah Mengal's 'Declaration of Independence'||The plight of small nations or nationalities situated in crucially strategic regions on the borderline between two great systems has ever been one of tragedy, threat of extermination, and an all-too-familiar manipulation of local aspirations towards self-determination by more powerful and cynical regimes. Baluchistan, Pakistan's largest province, presents a modern version of the classical dilemma of a small nation under siege. The dilemma is further aggravated by the developments preceding and since the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. This article, based on an interview with Ataullah Mengal, the Baluch leader who headed the only elected government of Baluchistan, considers the background of Baluch nationalism and the consequences of the 'Declaration of Independence' which, as Ataullah Khan Mengal makes clear in his interview, has been forced upon the Baluch in order to ensure their mere survival as a nationality. The interview itself is appended at the end of the article.||Lawrence Lifschultz

To quantify the implications of this objective, it is necessary to obtain reasonably good estimates of the labour force participation rates or the proportion of people who work or seek work. If these rates are available by sex and age, it becomes possible to calculate the number of new entrants into and withdrawals from the labour force. The two major sources of data on this subject are the decennial censuses and various Rounds of the National Sample Survey. The latter provide reasonably stable estimates of labour force participation rates only for the country as a whole, of course for rural and urban areas separately. The size of the sample limits the number of age groups for which estimates can be attempted. The census does not face the constraint of sample size. However, the 1971 census tables on the subject have been affected by a serious underenumeration of workers who worked 'secondarily' or in addition to some non-economic main activity. The published 1961 census tables provide a more comprehensive inventory of the labour force. However, they have been compiled for only broad age groups. This analysis of the level and nature of work participation by sex, age and marital status, is therefore, likely to prove useful to researchers on this subject.||Pravin Visaria

After Independence, priority was initially given to major irrigation projects, such as the Kosi project in north Bihar. This paper aims to study the changes in production pattern in the Kosi area and in a non-Kosi area. In doing so it looks at the varying practices of farmers according to size-class and crop. It concludes that the trends in area, production and productivity of the two main crops - viz, paddy and wheat - showed a weaker trend prior to introduction of HYV. Indeed, the difference made by the Kosi project was more evident after HYV made production profitable.||R. P. Singh

Attempts by the Western scholars to study and analyse the Soviet economy have, therefore, to be relied upon. This paper is an account of the findings of merican Societologists. It concludes that such studies have depicted a rather grey picture of the Soviet Union towards the year 2000. The American scholars suggest that the socialist system is losing momentum in its race with the capitalist world. According to them, its problems - viz, retardation in growth of national income and of different sectors, declining labour and capital productivity, lagging technology, shortage of foodgrains and livestock products, imbalance between demand for and supply of consumer goods, shortcomings in the management of enterprises, etc, - are specific to the socialist system with its highly centralised bureaucratic planning, strong party control and lack of personal initiative. These scholars also maintain that Soviet defence expenditure is exceedingly high, comparing the size of national incomes of the USSR and the US. In addition, the USSR's natural resources are fast depleting, the rate of growth of population and manpower is declining, and there is a growing regional imbalance in the location of resources and markets. Further still, the American view picturises the rulers of the Soviet Union as incapable of any imaginative and major improvements in the system, beyond tinkering with it.||R. G. Gidadhubli

There is indeed a need for developing a composite yardstick for the estimation of undernutrition taking all these factors into consideration.||C. Gopalan

It is one of the 'South Indian Villages' surveyed originally by Gilbert Slater and his students in 1916, with this village being the initial one surveyed by Slater personally. The main themes of the resurvey are change and continuity in the last 65 years in living conditions, technology, landownership and the village power structure as can be pieced together from the earlier evidence and the present investigation. The paper is published in two parts. In the first part, the authors deal with demographic factors, education, health and water supply. They move on then to the village economy and discuss costs and returns in paddy cultivation based on pumpset irrigation and the new technology, a feature on the 1960s and 1970s.||S. Guhan,Joan P.

2/7/1983- ||special articles||41626927||Barriers in Rural Development||Two prominent themes dominate current debates on problems of rural development in India: first, that rural development ought to receive higher priority and larger resources than it has received until now; second, that a decentralised pattern of organisation for formidating and implementing rural development programmes needs to be evolved. Viewing development as a process in which dissimilar communities and groups of people react to new economic opportunities, it is interesting to ask the question as to how this process would work itself out in the prospective rural context. This paper considers a relatively limited aspect of the question, viz, the factors which are likely to hinder the even spread of the development process across a typical planning area like a district or a block. It examines factors attributable to the characteristic features of the local level rural economies in India so that, while the author's data and illustrations are drawn from field studies done in the single district of Tumkur in Karnataka, his findings could be taken as having a fair measure of generality beyond the study area.||V M Rao

There has been conversion of whole communities, not merely the segment of each which impinges on the organised sector. Indeed, dowry as an organised-sector phenomenon is easily explained. But it is as a wholly unorganised sector phenomenon that the switch from bride-price to dowry is intriguing. First a search is needed for the necessary and sufficient conditions that have led to this; and second for an answer to the question as to whether and in what circumstances the system of dowry payment is more widely punitive in its incidence than the bride-price system. This paper examines both issues, and concludes that a dowry system which evolves from a bride-price system on account of a decline in female contribution to family income alone, without any other parallel developments, will have a punitive incidence no greater than that of the system replaced. For a dowry system to be more extensively punitive, there would be other accompanying developments that would make dowry lose its purely compensatory character.||Indira Rajaraman

The succession of recessions, the advance of inflation, and the doubling of unemployment in the West between the 1967 and the 1973-75 recessions and its doubling again from the latter recession to the present one, as well as restructuring of the world economy, arising from differential declines in productivity and consequent shifts in the political-economic balance of power in the West, have posed insurmountable, and still growing, obstacles to the effectiveness of formulation and implementation of political-economic policy at both the national and the international levels.||Andre Gunder Frank
10/12/1983- ||special articles||4372774||Culture and Cultural Planning in India||Modern India's cultural renaissance and the anti-colonial struggle were both expressions of the people's search for a national identity. The cultural workers of the pre-independence period did not live and work in ivory towers. They were deeply involved in the social challenges of their time. The anti-colonial struggle at its best assumed the form of a cultural movement and the cultural movement grew as an anti-colonial mobilisation in the realm of consciousness. Today, material prosperity has failed to enrich the quality of life. Exposure to commercial films has resulted in a massive disorientation of consciousness in urban areas. The most creative in the field of art and culture view their environment as entirely hopeless. Also, political parties and their workers do not seem to have much time left for regenerating culture. India's transformation into a civilised society crucially depends on the co-operation between science and culture and between scientific and cultural workers. The legacy of the West, with its acute antagonism between science and culture, is not helpful. The need is for a scientific humanism (or scientific culture) and for a humanistic (or culture oriented) science. Universities and research institutes have a part to play in bringing about this transformation. [The paper is being published in two parts. The concluding part will appear next week.]||P. C. Joshi

Capacities built over the past three decades are far in excess of present levels of production. This has happened in spite of the existence of the Industrial Licensing System (ILS) which was supposed to regulate and co-ordinate investments in order to achieve an optimal allocation of limited capital resources. Excessive capitalisation implies misallocation of foreign exchange as well as scarce national resources. In the protected Indian market and with a variety of fiscal and monetary concessions and subsidies, the large-scale organised sector is able to flourish regardless of this vast squandering of resources. This co-existence of private gain and social loss calls for a deeper inquiry, covering also an examination of the very rationale of the policies being pursued and the structure that today exists for planned national development. The survey also brings out that violations of the ILS are more prominent in the case of trans-nationals and Indian monopoly houses. The violations are of various kinds. Given this operational ineffectiveness of the ILS, it is time that available policy alternatives are considered and a co-ordinated action plan is prepared to remedy the situation. [This paper is based on a Report on "Functioning of Industrial Licensing System" prepared by the Corporate Studies Group of the Indian Institute of Public Administration, New Delhi. The members of the Corporate Studies Group are S K Goyal, K S Chalapati Rao, Nagesh Kumar, Anil Nauriya, B M Gupta, Kamal Mitra Chenoy, K V K Ranganathan, M R Murthy and D N Sharma.]||

This article, while analysing colonial and post-colonial forest policies, concentrates on the historical process whereby the traditionally-held rights of the forest communities have been progressively curtailed through the development of forest policy, management and legislation. While the social imperatives behind forest policy have differed in the two periods under review - being the strategic interests of British imperialism before 1947 and after that the needs of the merchantile and industrial bourgeoisie - the impact on forest dwellers and their life-support systems has been a uniform one. The post-colonial state has taken over and further strengthened the organising principles of colonial forest administration - the assertion of state monopoly right and exclusion of forest communities. Section I of the paper deals with forestry in British India and Section II the post-colonial situation. Section III discusses the evolution of forest legislation. In Section IV are set out the author's conclusions. The paper is published in two parts. Sections I and II appear below, while the last two sections will be published next week.||Ramachandra Guha

This happens naturally when one is dealing with cross-section data. Unless one is dealing with pooled time-series and cross-section data, the problem of considering the effects of price variations of a commodity does not arise.

28/5/1983- ||review of management, may 1983||4372152||Reporting of Industrial Capacities: Review of Company Annual Reports||This paper presents the main findings of a review of the information on industrial licences held, capacities installed and actual production as reported in nearly 2,000 Annual Reports of companies. In assessing the effectiveness of the Industrial Licensing System (ILS) on the basis of information disclosed in the Annual Reports of companies, it is necessary to keep in mind that the primary decision whether or not a product falls in the Scheduled Industry list, to attract the provisions of the Industrial Development and Regulation Act (IDRA), is that of the company managements. The responsibility of ensuring that false claims are not made by companies rests with the Ministry or Department of Company Affairs. The administration of the IDRA, however, is the responsibility of the Ministry of Industry (Department of Industrial Development). If a unit undertakes manufacture of products falling under a Scheduled Industry but does not apply to the Central government for grant of an appropriate industrial licence, or if an undertaking does not possess an industrial licence for the goods manufactured on the plea that the item was not a Scheduled Industry, who would be the arbitrator? It is not very clear. Similarly, the nature of action that can be taken against those who give incorrect information under the Companies Act regarding their obligations under another statute - the IDRA - is a matter which can be decided by legal experts alone. This paper only points out the contradictions in the information and the reporting practices in the organised corporate sector. The main thrust of the review is to highlight various short-comings of the ILS, as revealed by the information provided by the companies themselves. [This paper is based on a Report on "Functioning of Industrial Licensing System" prepared by the Corporate Studies Group of the Indian Institute of Public Administration, New Delhi. The members of the Corporate Studies Group are S K Goyal, K S Chalapati Rao, Nagesh Kumar, Anil Nauriya, B M Gupta, Kamal Mitra Chenoy, K V K Ranganathan M R Murthy and D N Sharma.]||

Three criteria can be applied. First, the experiments should achieve a limited objective of developing new ways of managing activities and demonstrate its usefulness. Second, these should be institutionalised within the experimental area. Third, the new methodologies and systems should be diffused in all the project districts. This paper seeks to evaluate the India Population Project as a case study in management interventions in established bureaucracies in a social development programme.||Rushikesh Maru,Nirmala Murthy,J.

There are several possible explanations, but foremost among them one would rank the sheer intellectual challenge posed by the extraordinary complexity and uniqueness of India's monetary experience in its evolution from a silver to a gold exchange standard. In the life and work of Keynes India loomed large, but, surprisingly, even the prolific symposia published on virtually every aspect of Keynes' life and work do not contain a single piece on Keynes' Indian Connection. The present essay is contributed in the hope that it will stimulate interested scholars to research this fascinating theme.||Anand G. Chandavarkar

30/7/1983- ||review of political economy, july 1983||4372357||Towards a Correct Reading of Lenin's Theory of Imperialism||Lenin's has been the most authoritative of all the theories put forward so far to explain the phenomenon of imperialism. For the same reason, it has been subjected to the greatest amount of sniping by both enemies and misguided adherents of Marxism. Lenin set out to do two things at the same time: he outlined the general problematic of explanation of potential or actual armed conflicts in the phase of monopoly capital, and at the same time he applied his theoretical framework to explain the First World War, the particular conflagration which set the background for the October Revolution. Lenin provided the axioms and relations which would demonstrate that capitalism in the phase of monopoly capital was globally unstable as an inter-national state system, and he imposed particular restrictions on those relations to show how the First World War came about. The present paper attempts a restatement and interpretation of Lenin's theory, so as to bring out its logical structure and its enormous explanatory power, without robbing it of scientific content in the process. The richness and complexity of Lenin's theory can lift its extension to comprehened contemporary problems out of the barren field of a scholastic exercise.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi
09/4/1983- ||special articles||4372067||RDAs: Their Limitations and Application||This paper illustrates the many types of problems encountered in uncovering data on which to base recommended daily allowances (RDAs). The latter are, therefore, neither sacrosanct nor immutable but represent an informed judgement of current experimental data and everyday experience. Various conceptual difficulties are outlined, the major one being the hgih degree of variation among individuals and even in the same individual. In consequence RDA values also have little applicability to individual diets, expect in extreme instances. Regulatory applications in assessing known or new foods again come up against problems of the individual. Estimates of malnutrition from dietary intake data considered in relation to RDAs are now known to be in serious error because of the wide range of individual homeostasis. Projections from RDAs via corresponding balanced diets to national food supplies do enable policy decisions, but do not solve the problem of equitable distribution according to nutritional need.||K.

12/2/1983- ||special article||4371849||The Era of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah||The era of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah was marked by a single-minded assertion by the people of Kashmir of their 'identity'. The question of its external affiliation - constitutionally, politically and emotionally - had, more or less, been stabilised during the life-time of the leader who had symbolised Kashmiri aspirations uninterruptedly for over half a centry. This paper attempts a retrospective assessment of the era of Sheikh Abdullah and the prospects for the future development of Kashmiri identity within the state as well as in the country. The paper is divided into four sections. Section I traces the historical assertion of Kashmiri identity in the context of political awakening in the state which first took the form of Muslim consciousness and opposition to Dogra rule but which soon shed its exclusive Muslim character and became a struggle against monarchy itself. Section II delineates the various regional identities within the state of Jammu and Kashmir and the attempts of the National Conference, representative organisation of the overwhelming majority of the population in the Valley, to incorporate them within its fold. Sections III and IV, consider the continuing efforts to evolve a composite identity for the state and the obstacles in the emergence and consolidation of such an identity. Sections I and II of the paper appeared last week. Sections III and IV are published below.||Balraj Puri

Consequently, the Nambootiris have also lost the status, power and authority which they enjoyed in the villages during the pre-reform period. The gain of land by the groups which were traditionally dependent on the Nambootiris as cultivating tenants, viz, the Ambalavasis, Nayars, Maniyanis, Vaniyas and the Tiyyas, has brought about a marked improvement in their economic condition, and altered the traditional patron-client and reciprocal and redistributive relationships which charactensed the pre-reform village economy and society. It has also transformed the pre-reform subservient socio-economic relations of these groups, towards the Nambootiris, into egalitarian relations. The remaining four groups, viz, the Mavans, artisans and service castes, harijans and the Mappilas, have not benefited much by the redistribution of land, especially wet land.||P Radhakrishnan

Many, and particularly those at the government end, will feel that it would be best, for the next few years at least, to see how things work out, and not to think in terms of further changes. Certainly, further hurried modifications or fresh provisions would be unwise, but this should not prevent continuing critical examination of the Act and its working, and further amendment when found necessary. This paper critically examines the changes proposed to be made, through the amending bill, pertaining to Piracy, Compulsory Licensing, Protection to Authors and Corporate Copyright.||Samuel Israel

The identity question of the Bengali Muslims has been an oscillation between the two poles; and the question continues to generate controversies and passions in Bangladesh. The problems encompass the Bengali language itself, Bengali cultural heritage as a whole, Bangladesh's demarcation from West Bengal as a unique cultural entity, Islam, and secularism. This paper identifies and briefly examines three distinct movements in the Bengali Muslim quest for identity; unity in Islam, unity in Bengali and unity in Bengali Islam.||Jnanbrata Bhattacharyya

26/11/1983- ||review of management, november 1983||4372726||Women's Employment and Organisation Modes||While the need for more part-time jobs or the scope for self-employment may not be denied, it is arguable whether part-time home-based self-employment is what is best for women and what they themselves would prefer. Does home-based production lead to maximisation of output and income and therefore improvement in the economic condition of women? Does it contribute to improving their social status? If not, what is the best mode of organising economic activity for women? And is this alternative feasible in practice? Are there any intermediary solutions? This paper is an attempt to answer these questions. The first part examines the issues with specific reference to (a) the economics of collective production vs decentralised atomistic production, (b) ownership and control of assets and income, and (c) non-economic considerations. The second part reviews various organisational strategies adopted by poor self-employed women to overcome the disabilities experienced in individual enterprise.||Pushpa Sundar

Neither the ideological orientation of the novel nor its formal construction seems to have won the complete approval of the critics. This paper briefly reviews the 'problem' of Godan and offers some suggestions towards an alternative reading fo the novel, attending not so much to the characters as to the discursive levels of the text, and identifying the specificity of the textual structure in the conflict of ideological discourses. Its central argument is that Godan articulates a specific moment of modern Indian history rather than presenting a timeless portrait of Indian peasantry; the significance of the novel lies precisely in its ability to represent all the ideological voices of that moment entering into resonance or into conflict.||Prabhakara Jha

The extent of which commercialisation - the increasing absolute and relative importance of commodity exchange for cash - conditions this paucity of investible surplus is thus a relevant issue. Exchange relations cannot be divorced from the relations of production. If production conditions differ between various sections of the peasantry, so will exchange relations and so too will the outcome of these relations in terms of investible surplus and in terms of poverty and nutritional welfare. This paper examines production and exchange relations of rainfed agriculture to assess the nature of poverty. It uses data, provided by the All-India Co-ordinated Research Project for Dryland Agriculture, for a random sample of 261 producers in Hyderabad and Anantapur districts of Andhra Pradesh, in Bangalore district of Karnataka and Ramanathapuram and Tirunelveli districts of Tamil Nadu, all officially classified as drought-prone.||Barbara Harriss

09/7/1983- ||special articles||4372287||Estimation of Nutritional Intakes||Until the mid-sixties the nutrition problem was looked upon as one of protein deficiency, mainly the deficiency of quality and animal foods. This Western myth was exploded subsequently by scholars who showed with a wealth of data that calorie deficiency was of much greater concern. In almost all classes, there was no group that was protein deficient but not calorie deficient. It was then taken for granted that adequate calorie intake is a sufficient condition for adequate protein intake and utilisation. Recently, however, this preoccupation with calorie has given way to an understanding of the ill-effects of the imbalance of other nutrients as well. This paper estimates the intake of different nutrients as well as of calorie. It finds that income is the major factor influencing the intake of various nutrients. Among its other findings is that intakes of calorie and protein increase with the size of land holdings. Moreover, it is definite that the calorie situation has deteriorated between the 60s and the 70s. Inequality in real incomes seems to have increased between the 60s and the 70s, since it is evident that the gap in the shares of calorie from cereals and from substitutes, as also the gap in the calorie intake among different expenditure groups, have widened.||Rajaram Dasgupta

Section I of the paper deals with the heterogeneity in terms of population size, population density, sex ratio, proportion of population that is urban, etc. Section II presents the pattern of population growth in the four States and Pondicherry, by regions within each State and by districts. Section III looks at the components of population growth, namely, births, deaths and migration. Section IV discusses the socio-economic conditions and changes in these conditions which lead to these demographic characteristics. Finally, Section V indicates likely trends in population growth in the future. The data are drawn mainly from the decennial Censuses of India, National Sample Survey reports and Sample Registration Scheme. Data provided by demographic surveys, statistical abstracts and individual scholars have also been put together.||P. Hanumantha Rayappa,N. R. Prabhakara

01/10/1983- ||special articles||4372555||Joan Robinson: An Appreciation||Throughout her very productive life as a creative economic theorist, Joan Robinson maintained that economics was not a 'game', played for its own sake. She was profoundly concerned with the social relevance of economics. She attached much greater importance to the seriousness and integrity of an economist than to her/his ability to solve complicated intellectual puzzles. Her sympathies for developing countries were profound and the significance of her work in analysing the phenomenon of underdevelopment is not yet fully appreciated. The portrait of Joan Robinson as a great polemicist is the one generally known, but her substantive contributions in different branches of economics have been much greater. What is more, she has left us with a very rich set of questions to which we can devote ourselves profitably for years to come, be it in her treatment of markets, or of long-period growth or analysis of comparative economic systems or the methodological issues of bringing in real 'time' in economic models.||Sukhamoy Chakravarty

Despite this limitation, however, the acute difficulty encountered by Finance Ministers in enhancing the investment component of incremental resource mobilisation in the recent years has been obvious. Financing of revenue expenditure out of potential or actual savings is clearly harmful. The economic effects of raising 'additional' resources, which are often largely in the nature of intra-public sector transfers, similarly need thorough examination. All the more so, when the same tax base is often exploited by governments at different levels. In today's circumstances, it would be too much perhaps to expect the Central Budget to be a vehicle of such fiscal reforms, but, at the same time, in their absence the effectiveness of the budget as an instrument of development does become limited.||N.

Therefore, the banking industry must be on a sound footing. While in India, there is stress on the social responsibility of banks, the significance of liquidity and profitability is not to be neglected. The financial viability of the banking system is certainly essential, not only to instill public confidence but also to make banks capable of discharging their social responsibilities. Further, the rate of profit is taken as an indicator of the operational efficiency of banks, and this has an added relevance when Indian banks are operating branches in foreign countries. This study aims mainly at assessing the productivity and profitability of Indian scheduled commercial banks during the period 1969-80. Section I presents an analysis of the broad pattern of earnings, expenses and level of profit during the period. Section II discusses the trends in profitability ratios. The data used in this study are compiled from the RBI publications: Statistical Tables relating to Banks in India, Trends and Progress of Banking in India, and Banking Statistics.||V. B. Angadi,V.

29/1/1983- ||review of political economy, january 1983||4371798||The Bigoted Julaha||This paper investigates the origins of a colonial portrait - that of the 'bigoted Julaha'. The 'bigoted Julaha' was a firmly established colonial stereotype in northern India by the end of the nineteenth century. Yet, as an explanation of a particular group's involvement in communalist politics, the argument of 'instinctive bigotry' has little to commend it. Widespread dissatisfaction with historiographies that depended on such empty stereotypes has led, in more recent days, to the growing popularity of certain alternative trends, represented by, on the one hand, Western liberal scholars and their Indian counterparts and, on the other hand, a Marxist-oriented nationalist historiography. For both groups of scholars the question of economic interests is central: their microscopes are riveted on the economic roots of the discontent that went to make up communalism at the grass-roots level. Yet no satisfactory answer is forthcoming as to why discontent over material conditions should be channelled into communal conflict. In the last few years, however, more than one writer on the subject has called for an analysis of communalism in wider terms, encompassing not only 'interests' but also 'ideas or (religious) traditions' and the 'lay of social relationships' which provide the context wherein special affinities are experienced and expressed. Several scholars have now begun to explore the field of peasant consciousness and ideology; others have focused on the notion of a 'community consciousness' to explain important aspects of politics among Muslim peasants and mill workers between 1890s and the 1940s. In taking a brief look at the history of the north Indian Muslim weavers, formerly known as Julahas, and attempting to identify the origins of their reputation for bigotry and fanaticism, this paper does not directly tackle the question of consciousness: nonetheless, the author hopes that it makes a marginal contribution to the debate in this area.||Gyanendra Pandey

This study of child labour in Sivakasi, where 45,000 children work, in the match and fireworks industries, seeks to go beyond the surface reality and investigate : (1) the basic socio-economic reasons for the perpetuation of child labour in Sivakasi; (2) extent to which the local and Central governments have been negligent and apathetic to the plight of the working children; (3) how government policy affects the Sivakasi match industry; (4) extent of violation of laws binding on employers of children; and (5) laws relating to child labour in general. The other issues discussed here are the working conditions of child labour, occupational hazards, rights child workers have in a. factory, employer-labour relationship, and the compulsions that force parents to send their children to work.||Smitu Kothari

This power, which they continue to wield, has its chief economic base in sugar, i e, both cultivation of sugarcane and its processing. An attempt is made in this paper to understand the main mechanism — payment of sugarcane prices — through which the rich peasant cultivators of sugarcane use the industrial extension of their agrarian operations to further their accumulation of capital. For the purpose, cane prices paid to growers by three co-operatives in Ahmednagar district over a seven-year period, 1974-75 to 1980-81, are analysed. This span of time covers the most recent sugarcane production cycle, from a trough in 1975-76 to the next trough in 1979-80. The discussion is broken up into six sections. First, the mechanism through which a co-operative sugar factory arrives at the cane price is briefly looked at. This price consists of two parts, namely, a support price for sugarcane fixed annually by the Government of India and a share in the profits accruing to the co-operatives chiefly from the marketing of sugar. Official policies pertaining to prices of both sugarcane and sugar are, therefore, discussed in Section II. Sugarcane prices fluctuated a great deal over the period 1974-75 to 1980-81. Two sets of factors have been identified as influencing cane prices. They are referred to as external and local, and are briefly studied in i Sections III and IV, respectively. In Section V, the sugarcane price paid by a loss-making co-operative is discussed. The whole discussion is then summed up in the final section.||Ignatius Chithelen

Rather, the 'Great Leap Forward' was seen as a model for inspiration and this period was characterised by mass campaigns combined with ambitious targets for economic development and imports of foreign technology. The first steps in the direction of an economic policy similar to the economic reforms in Eastern Europe were taken in China only in 1978 and by the following year market socialism was on the agenda. Even so, the agreement was not unanimous and discussions on the theme 'market versus plan' seemed to reflect contradictions between statists (bureaucracy) and market reformists (technocracy), with the technocracy as the leading force. The bureaucracy and the technocrats together, however, apparently agreed to slowly push the Great Leap Forward group - exemplified by Hua Guofeng and Chen Yonggui - out of the centre of the political scene. Towards the end of 1981 and subsequently market reforms came under criticism and it seemed that the plan-supporters, or the bureaucracy, emerged in the leading role. What will be the consequence if market reforms are slowed down and the planning system is to be reinforced? Will the political struggle in China then take the form of sharpened conflict between bureaucracy and technocracy, or will groups advocating specifically Chinese economic strategies, such as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, return to the centre of the political scene?||Peer Moller Christensen

30/7/1983- ||review of political economy, july 1983||4372358||International Relocation of Production and Industrialisation in LDCs||The international relocation of manufacturing production has, it would seem, contributed to the rapid growth of manufactured exports and industrialisation in a few countries of the third world. It has become fashionable to focus on the recent development experience of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan with the prescription that their experience can be replicated advantageously in other third world countries. Such an approach to the East Asian experience, as "export-led industrialisation", implies, first, that the production of manufactured exports was the leading factor in their growth process and, second, that this pattern of growth constitutes genuine industrialisation. This paper questions both these propositions and critically evaluate the notion that similar export-led industrialisation can work across the board in other third world countries. Section I of the paper analyses recent trends in the international relocation of manufacturing production. Section II attempts a broad quantitative assessment of LDC participation in world industrialisation and trade. Section III narrows the focus to examine the relocation of manufacture in the LDCs by the transnational corporations. Section IV examines economic factors behind the international relocation. Section V discusses the possibilities of replicating the East Asian experience in other LDCs. Finally, Section VI examines the wider implications of the attempt at a similar path for other LDCs.||Deepak Nayyar

The projection exercise is carried out at base year prices so as to avoid the difficulties in making allowance for price rise during the period of projection. The basic assumptions made in this study are related primarily to changes in population and consumption expenditure. Government policies regarding agricultural development are assumed to remain unchanged. Besides, interregional homogeneity of consumer behaviour is also assumed. Section I of the study deals with the methodology, data base, commodity and period coverage in the study. The basic assumptions are analysed next, while Section III is devoted to a discussion of the findings of the study. Demand for foodgrains on an average increase by 16 per cent during each quinquennial period. Among cereals, demand for Wheat grows faster than that for rice. Among the other food items the demand for milk is seen to increase at a faster rate than that for sugar, meat, fish, eggs and edible Oil.||R Kannan,T K Chakrabarty

26/11/1983- ||special articles||4372729||Non-Maximising Behaviour of Farmers: Sales||Standard economic theory treats the Economic Man as a maximising agent. The universal assumption is that a producer or seller is a maximiser of short-run profit and this is common to neo-classical and Marxian economics. A close look at the decisions taken by farmers in India, however, suggests that they are guided by considerations other than maximisation of short-run profit. The author investigates two important decisions every farmer has to take. The first relates to the crop combination selected by him for cultivation and the second to the time of sale of the saleable part of his harvest. Profit maximisation would, in the first case, make the farmer cultivate only such crops as, subject to probabilities, promise to yield the maximum profit in production. In the second case, the guiding principle would make him sell all his marketable surplus of a crop at the maximum price fetched by the crop. In actual fact farmers cultivate a whole range of crops, obviously not all profit maximising, and they sell their crops in several instalments, spread over the time between two successive harvests. This paper presents the results of an investigation into the apparently 'irrational' behaviour of farmers in regard to the pattern of sales of their crops, other than paddy, over time. The author had dealt with crop selection by farmers in an earlier paper.||Ashok Rudra

Some of these estimates have been in the nature of 'informed guesses'. Others have attempted to articulate and deploy analytical methods which have the advantage of facilitating discussion and assessment of the techniques used, and not just the results obtained. A third category of writers present estimates which purport to be based on the application of analytical techniques, but do not delineate their methods in sufficient detail to permit adequate assessment. The principal objective of this paper is to present a critical survey of the second category of estimates of the unaccounted economy in India. Some reference will also be made, in passing, to exercises from the third category. A second objective is to outline a taxonomy for the various estimation approaches that have been essayed in India and abroad. This is done in Section III, immediately following a brief Section II, which draws some key conceptual distinctions. Sections IV through VII evaluate four studies recently conducted for India, each exemplifying a different approach to the problem. Section VIII draws together the estimates produced by the various approaches for ready comparison and comment. The final Section offers some concluding remarks.||Shankar Acharya

Applied with moderation and supplemented by suitable changes in credit policy, these measures will impart a healthy tone to business behaviour. If the same approach is applied also in respect of government activities, it will eventually restore health to government finances. The author substantiates his argument by referring to some specific proposals of the Budget - those disallowing 20 per cent of certain types of business expenses, limiting deductions in the nature of incentives to 70 per cent of business income, extending the facility of long-term savings to HUFs and discontinuing deductions available in respect of contributions to approved programmes of rural development.||M.

05/2/1983- ||special articles||4371826||The Era of Sheikh Mohammed Abdullah||The era of Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah was marked by a single-minded assertion by the people of Kashmir of their 'identity'. The question of its external affiliation - constitutionally, politically and emotionally - had, more or less, been stabilised during the life-time of the leader who had symbolised Kashmiri aspirations uninterruptedly for over half a century. This paper attempts a retrospective assessment of the era of Sheikh Abdulla and the prospects for the future development of Kashmiri identity within the state as well as in the country. The paper is divided into four sections. Section I traces the historical assertion of Kashmiri identity in the context of political awakening in the state which first took the form of Muslim consciousness and opposition to Dogra rule but which soon shed its exclusive Muslim character and became a struggle against monarchy itself. Section II delienates the various regional identities within the state of Jammu and Kashmir and the attempts of the National Conference, representative organisation of the overwhelming majority of the population in the Valley, to incorporate them within its fold. Sections III and IV, which will be published next week, consider the continuing efforts to evolve a composite identity for the state and the obstacles in the emergence and consolidation of such an identity.||Balraj Puri

First, the profit rate varies directly with the size the company, what is more, the degree of fluctuation over time varies inversely with the size of the company. Second, the growing divergence between the profitability of the typically big and the small companies and the relative instability in the profit of the latter connote that typically a small company operates in a more uncertain and less rewarding environment and that, as a result, it can hardly aspire to climb the ladder in the corporate jungle. Third, it can be said that in the corporate sector, small and the big capitalists do not enjoy a uniform rate of profit. For their investment decision they do not, therefore, look up the same schedule of marginal efficiency of capital, if they at all care to look at it.||Ranjit Sau

Indeed, such an analysis cannot be carried out without bearing in mind the interests of the four major groups in the industry - viz, the several lakhs of jute growers, the 2.5 lakh employees, the few industrialist families, and the State. The present study concludes that there is no crisis in the jute industry. In fact, the industry has gained by exploiting the jute growers and the workers and by receiving generous public assistance. Profitability and productivity have increased substantially, despite erosion of capital stock.||Swapan Kumar Sen

(ii) What determines the share taken as rent under the crop share mode of payment? (iii) Why are cash rents significantly lower than the value of crop share rents in Haryana and Punjab? (iv) Given that both the typical cash rents and the typical share crop rents are far below what the landowner could earn by selling his land and investing the proceeds in, say, a fixed deposit account why do not landlords sell? In this paper, some non-conventional answers to these questions are formulated, which are consistent with the facts of recent experience in Haryana.||Sheila Bhalla

The fragmentation arises not only from various characteristics relating to the land but also government rules and regulations which may not apply to all the land in the urban fringe area uniformly. Divergence in value exists not only over space but also over time. As such, this fertile ground for speculative activity. The speculative activity is further encouraged by a relatively low element of risk and uncertainty in the market. This in turn originates in the fact that the speculator is sure of being able to pass on the 'costs' of even 'government intervention' to the consumer. The speculators, operate in an oligopolistic land market, and have been able to manipulate the provisions of the various Acts to their own advantage. The public policy measures, therefore, have not only been ineffective but have in fact led to a worsening of the situation in the land market.||Kiran Wadhva

It is useful, therefore, to bring out not only some of the methodological problems, but also the absurdities of some of the results obtained insofar as India is concerned owing to deficiencies of the data base.||Arun Ghosh

It is generally believed that the new direction given to the banks since their nationalisation in 1969, and the slackening productivity, have led to a declining trend in the profits and profitability of the banks. It is even held that, unless the present trend is reversed, the financial viability of our banking system may be undermined. Since commercial banks constitute the most important channel for financial intermediation in India, it is necessary to find satisfactory answers to some of these nagging doubts about our banking system. The questions that need to be answered are: (a) Has there actually been a declining trend in the profits and profitability of Indian commercial banks in the seventies? (b) What are the main factors that affect the profit performance of commercial banks in India, especially of Indian banks? This study attempts to examine these issues in greater depth.||S. K.

The paper argues that while certain steps taken by the government may have helped this upsurge, the upsurge itself cannot be solely attributed to any 'Islamic revivalism' or resurgence of 'Islamic fundamentalism' but rather to the initiative taken in this regard by some oil-rich Muslim countries in West Asia who have encouraged and in many cases generously financed Islamic missionary activities in Bangladesh. An equally crucial factor contributing to the upsurge of Islamic activities in the country has been certain internal developments including the imposition of restrictions upon political activities, the co-option by the regime of hitherto discarded rightist elements who now form its support base, the sagging economy and the consequent acute economic distress - all of which have driven the masses of the people to the promised comfort and peace of Islam.||Emajuddin Ahamed

An integrated conceptual approach to micro-planning to meet these needs is, therefore, presented in this paper. Central to such planning is the concept of essential forestry, designed to furnish fuel, timber, fruits, fodder, and manure, and to serve as a pivotal point to open up ways of meeting other basic human requirements. This paper will appear in two parts. Part I, appearing this week, comprises four sections. Section I underscores the role of planning, at the micro-level, from below. Section II takes stock of the basic needs of people and describes the materials necessary to fulfil these needs. Section III enumerates the resource endowments that can make available these materials. Section IV specifies the tree species that must be included in essential forestry to meet the various needs. Sections V and VI which are part of Part II, to follow, describe the agricultural system and the supportive animal system, respectively, required by the micro-planning envisaged. Section VII covers necessary energy resources, and Section VIII the income supplementation that may be necessary. The last Section IX summarises certain conclusions.||Vinod K. Huria,K. T. Achaya

It tries to bring out that inter-period comparison in output instability - especially of the periods pertaining to the pre-HYV and the post-HYV phases of Indian agricultural history - is not as sure a guide to assessing the stabilisation role of irrigation as is contemporaneous comparison between irrigated output and rainfed output fluctuations during a given period. The paper concludes that during drought farmers in the state follow a strategy of protecting crop yield at the expense of shrinkage in irrigated acreage, especially of crops needing summer irrigation. On the other hand, in years of above normal rainfall, farmers are known to maximise production, utilising extra water availability, by expanding acreage under irrigation. This imparts considerable instability to irrigated farming in the state, a major part of which is traceable to area instability. However, further investigations are called for since the instability in irrigated farming is found to be no different from the one existing under dry farming.||B. D. Dhawan

This paper considers the present forest policy from the point of view of the forest dwellers themselves whose interests have to be primary in any formulation of a new forest policy. It begins with a brief account of the historical evolution of the official forest policy in India and the various changes that have been brought about in forest policy since Independence. It considers and criticises the provisions of the Indian Forest Bill, 1980, and proposes detailed guidelines for a new forest policy. Such a policy, the author argues, should aim, first, at maintaining ecological and environmental balance, second, at meeting the basic needs of the forest dwellers by way of food, fuel and shelter and, finally, at meeting also the needs of forest-based industries as well those of the urban population.||Sharad Kulkarni

Both before and after Independence, the white sugar mill industry has been closely guided by State policy and intervention. In this paper, we are concerned with the growth of the modern sugar mill industry and the political economy of State intervention in the period 1932 (when tariff protection was granted) to 1947.||Sanjaya Baru

The far higher than expected rate of increase in population, revealed in the results of the 1981 Census, however, would have an impact on this original aim. This paper explores the implications of this unexpected change for the Plan objective. In doing so, it keeps to the analytical frame of poverty reduction and income redistribution set by the Sixth Plan. The authors attempt to demystify the logic of the Sixth Plan exercises; to estimate the population in the base year and on that basis look at the incidence of poverty in the base year; to examine the possibility of attaining poverty reduction targets through growth alone; and then to re-examine the extent of redistribution required to attain the poverty reduction target. They also examine the vital question of equity in redistribution across the rural-urban divide and consider certain wider issues connected with the feasibility of redistribution postulated in the Sixth Plan. Lastly, a postscript looks at new data that have become available.||K. Sundaram,S. D. Tendulkar

22/10/1983- ||special articles||4372630||Financing Regional Development at State Level: Case for a Location Tax||The National Committee on the Development of Backward Areas has recently reported that the major Central government incentive for development of backward areas - the Central Investment Subsidy - and the concessional finance provided by the all-India term-lending institutions have mainly benefited States and Union Territories which were not classified as industrially backward by the Pande Working Group and that most of the districts which received substantial benefit are "in close proximity to relatively developed industrial centres". As regards concessional institutional finances, the Committee points out that 55 per cent of such assistance has gone to units in backward areas of States not considered to be backward and further that "a significant proportion of the finance" to backward districts was not on concessional but on normal lending terms. The allocation of resources mobilised at the State level to centres located far away from growth points in the State seems to be no better. The author here proposes a location tax as a fiscal mechanism to financial resources from economic activities in developed locations of a State for financing the development of backward areas. Such a tax, apart from allowing for transfer of resources, would also offer tax-preferential treatment to economic activities in the backward areas.||V. D. Lall

25/6/1983- ||special article||4372261||Premchand and the Peasantry: Constrained Radicalism||The overwhelming concern of the fiction of Premchand is the village which is perceived at times ('romantically') as the sole bastion of humanity in the face of industrialisation and consequent social erosion and at times ('realistically') as the scene of unrelieved exploitation and consequent dehumanisation. While this tension in the perception of the village continued till the very end, Premchand's work showed a general shift from romanticisation to confrontation with reality. With the passage of time, there was also a tendency to curb the 'winged irresponsibility' of the creative writer and to look for more realistic solutions to the ills of rural society. This paper traces this shift and attempts to analyse the tensions that underlay that transition. It notes that while Premchand's writings are marked by a profound understanding of, and sympathy for, the oppressed peasantry, they are also marked by an inability to accept the dynamic potential of sections within the rural society to revolt against such oppression and bring about radical social changes. This sharpness of perception of social reality, and an inability to see the possibility of changes in the condition of the oppressed peasantry ever being initiated by the oppressed themselves, only reflected the intellectual and political dilemma of one who, born in a colonial society, merely aspired for a juster social order in accordance with his intellectual aims and despite his instinctive class affiliations.||Geetanjali Pandey

This paper presents a critical assessment of the movements restriction policy of the government of Tamil Nadu. It focuses mainly on the following issues: (a) The influence of zonal arrangements (i e, inter-district movement restrictions) on the volume of procurement. (b) The impact of movement restrictions on market price. It arrives at certain conclusions about the relation between procurement levels and method or source of procurement, nature of movement restrictions, differential between open market price and procurement price and between prices in surplus and deficit regions, and non-price factors.||T.

The studies of nutritional conditions of children below 5 years of age in the two villages of Sahajapur and Kuchli provide firm evidence of (1) remarkably high incidence of undernourishment, even of the 'severe' and 'disastrous' types, and (2) systematic sex bias reflected in higher deprivation of girls vis-a-vis boys. The sex bias is reflected both in (i) the greater prevalence of undernourishment of various degrees among girls than among boys, and also (ii) in the lower growth dynamics of girls vis-a-vis boys. Interestingly enough, the village with the better over-all nutritional record has much sharper sex discrimination. The economic benefits accruing to the children of Kuchli through land reform, etc, seem to have primarily benefited boys vis-a-vis girls. The performance of girls in terms of nutritional criteria are broadly similar in the two villages, and it is the better position of boys in Kuchli that seems to make both the average nutritional record of Kuchli noticeably higher and also the extent of sex bias clearly greater. The authors discuss possible influences operating on the two villages which may throw light on the various contrasts between them as well as some policy issues related to the respective roles of land reform and direct nutritional intervention.||Amartya Sen,Sunil Sengupta

17/12/1983- ||special articles||4372795||Culture and Cultural Planning in India||Modern India's cultural renaissance and the anti-colonial struggle were both expressions of the people's search for a national identity. The cultural workers of the pre-independence period did not live and work in ivory towers. They were deeply involved in the social challenges of their time. The anti-colonial struggle at its best assumed the form of a cultural movement and the cultural movement grew as an anti-colonial mobilisation in the realm of consciousness. Today, material prosperity has failed to enrich the quality of life. Exposure to commercial films has resulted in a massive disorientation of consciousness in urban areas. The most creative in the field of art and culture view their environment as entirely hopeless. Also, political parties and their workers do not seem to have much time left for regenerating culture. India's transformation into a civilised society crucially depends on the co-operation between science and culture and between scientific and cultural workers. The legacy of the West, with its acute antagonism between science and culture, is not helpful. The need is for a scientific humanism (or scientific culture) and for a humanistic (or culture oriented) science. Universities and research institutes have a part to play in bringing about this transformation. [This is the concluding part of the paper which has been published in two parts. The first part appeared last week.]||P. C. Joshi

To address this issue the authors have formulated a simple model which characterises demand and supply in the formal and informal credit markets as well as the links between them. The authors then identify those parameters of the model, the empirical magnitudes of which are crucial for assessing the efficacy of official monetary-credit policy in altering the cost of funds in the informal market. Finally, these parameters have been estimated using anual time series data for the period 1951-52 to 1976-77.||Shankar Acharya,Srinivasa Madhur

Fundamental institutional reform has taken place amounting to a 'de-collectivisation' of the peasantry comparable in importance to the 'collectivisation' in the mid-1950s. A cornerstone of the 'Maoist model' of development was the rural collective structure. It appeared to many outside observers that China under Mao had been remarkably successful in evolving farm institutions that were capable of attaining rapid farm modernisation with a lower degree of inequality than existed in capitalist settings. Do China's recent agricultural reforms lead to the conclusion that this enthusiasm was based on misconceptions of the reality of China's farm sector under Mao? Do they reinforce the view that collective farms do not provide a viable alternative to private ownership for farm modernisation? To begin to answer such questions it is necessary to re-examine the record of China's agricultural collectives and establish the reasons behind 'de-collectivisation'. It is to this task that this paper is addressed. Section II of the paper summarises the principal stages of rural institutional change from the revolution to the present. Section III examines some of the problems with the methods of rural work organisation and income distribution in the 1960s and 1970s. Section IV looks at policies on rural capital formation and resource allocation. Section V assesses the performances of the collectives in terms of farm output, and peasant income and consumption. Section VI attempts to draw together the threads of the analysis into an explanation of the re-organisation of the past three years. This paper has been published in two parts. The first four sections of the paper appeared last week and sections V and VI are printed below.||Peter Nolan

The subjective consciousness of discrimination, which is today fairly widespread among Sikhs in Punjab, has been accentuated and used by interests who have been dissatisfied with the direction of mainstream Akali politics in particular and Indian politics in general. The marked difference between the level of the Akali Dal's mobilisation for the 'nehar roko morcha' as a purely economic protest and of the present agitation is a reminder of the formidable mobilising potential of religion. To understand the Akali agitation and the demands raised by it, the author reviews briefly the social and historical context of Punjab politics and the ideology and leadership of the Akali Dal before analysing the immediate social and economic context of the agitation.||Harish K.

Clearly, the assumptions of the method are irrelevant in the Indian context and the method is too simplistic.||J. C. Sandesara

This article first reviews literature on this concept. It then raises the main issue: Can such a concept account satisfactorily for Calcutta's economy? In other words, is it valid in Calcutta's context, and how could it be improred? It incorporates a survey of informal sector units operating in a Calcutta slum.||Emmanuel Romatet
