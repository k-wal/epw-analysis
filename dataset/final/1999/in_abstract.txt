Cited as the most important crop, the reason quoted by the farmers is its capacity to take care of basic food requirement of the family. But how far is it true? Is it pertinent to consider only the general aversion to risk-taking in rural area and consequently the preference of a safer rice-culture? Are there not other factors for its popularity? This empirical analysis along with the underlining logic, will enable us to formulate hypotheses regarding risks taken in a restrictive environment.||Veronique Alary

As a result, while population has grown, agricultural productivity has not increased and resources have been degraded. Food availability has declined. A way out is to commercially use the biophysical features unique to the areas while protecting the environment.||Shantanu Nagpal

Not only have the WUAs increased their irrigated area but also the water use efficiency has been found to be higher after the irrigation management was transferred to the members of WUAs. The WUAs have considerably improved the recovery of water charges thereby bringing revenue to the government. Moreover, the WUAs, by charging much higher amount from their water users, have accumulated funds for the maintenance of their micro structures and continue to survive and thrive even after management subsidy of the government has ceased to exist.||Niranjan Pant

The present paper, based on empirical evidence, examines the scope of agricultural diversification by analysing various dimensions of the suggested alternative. It discusses prospects of the diversification alternative and its implication on employment, income, natural resources and ecology. An attempt is also made to propose future strategy for agricultural and economic development of Punjab in the post-green revolution period.||Ramesh Chand

The comparison questions whether the economic knowledge and the analytical methods used for planning and financing resettlement are adequate for achieving the goals of resettlement policy. Historically, research on involuntary resettlement has emerged primarily within the fields of anthropology and sociology. Economic research on displacement and resettlement, the author argues, is virtually missing - but would be indispensable to improving resettlement outcomes. The paper argues that the method of cost-benefit analysis, and the conventional project risk and sensitivity analyses used in projects entailing resettlement, are incapable of answering displacement's economic and financial challenges and in practice tolerate the structural underfinancing of resettlement operations. The author calls for a constructive "alliance" between economic and sociological knowledge on resettlement and argues that in-depth economic knowledge is indispensable to achieving two fundamental goals of resettlement policy: reduced displacement and development of resettlers' livelihoods, once they have moved.||Michael M.

Both agree that 'augmentation' is the solution. But true augmentation can only come from efficient use of water and tapping other sources of water. In the case of a natural resource such as water, requirements are to be brought down to the level of availability of river flows, not the other way around.||Ramaswamy R. Iyer

Firstly, such a regime clashes with the 1993 convention on biodiversity wherein 170 countries have upheld the need for diversity. Secondly, the increasing patenting of life forms in the developing countries by the MNCs under the pretext of bio-prospecting will lead to a patent regime overwhelmingly in favour of the developed countries. Moreover the 20-year period of product patent rights together with the monopoly marketing rights eliminates the possibility of competing with the MNCs on equal footing. In such a scenario, what should India's position be on this issue?||Biplab Dasgupta

But this term of administrative convenience has now been adopted by the tribals themselves to mean the dispossessed, deprived people of a region. There is no claim to being the original inhabitants of that region, but a prior claim to the natural resources is asserted vis-a-vis the outsiders and the dominant caste. The tribal identity now gives the marginalised peoples self-esteem and pride.||Virginius Xaxa

While the benefits of globalisation go to the seeds and chemical corporations through expanding markets, the cost and risks are exclusively born by the small farmers and landless peasants. While the commercial private seed supply system needs strong state regulation, farmer seed supply should function free of state interference with strong community control and public participation. Strong biosafety regulation with public participation is both a democratic and an ecological imperative.||Vandana Shiva,Ashok Emani,Afsar H. Jafri

After independence, conservation did become a goal. But forest management remains bureaucratised. Forestry research receives only a small part of plan allocations. Funding is often decided on purely technical criteria with no reference to local community needs. Production potential, limits to sustainable extraction and impact of the market must be considered when prioritising forest research activities.||Tapan Kumar Mishra

The situation calls attention to the problems of commercial agriculture in the region and to the role of the state in inducing such conditions. Internal social complexities such as the growth of local usury and the increasing individualisation of agriculture also compound such distress.||A. R. Vasavi

It is these reports that will survive as the archives of democracy in India. The Lentin Report on the deaths due to contaminated glycerine at the state run J J Hospital in Mumbai is such a document, a contender for the Great Indian Novel. The report examines four institutions, the hospital, the industry, the Food and Drug Administration and the politician, in painstaking detail showing how individual acts of corruption, each insulated in itself, together led to the tragedy. And, typically, its findings lie unattended till today.||Shiv Visvanathan

Though the city does possess a criss-crossing structure of social web independent of the state, its citizens lack democratic trust in government agencies which remain inaccessible and unaccountable to their grievances. In such circumstances, the judiciary happens to be the only arm of government, providing rudimentary relief to citizens. Given the intransparency of the doings of other government agencies, the judiciary remains the only recourse to compel these agencies to function responsibly and thus stage a semblance of public sphere.||Hans Dembowski

Two types of measures need to be introduced in the short run to minimise environmental degradation and realise sustainable development: economic instrument and government regulation. China has endeavoured to introduce and implement environmental legislation and management with some success. However, the introduction of economic instruments can only be effective in the context of a perfect market system and legal framework. Although China's market-oriented reforms have made good progress, there are as yet many imperfections.||Luo Deming

Yet, recent decades have also brought dismantling of community-based health and welfare programmes, with no discernable progress in extension of universal social security to the countryside. Rapid increases in absolute and relative population above age of 60, rising dependency ratios in which a shrinking labouring class must support the aged and infirm, and galloping inequality that threatens to make China's income distribution the most unequal in the world, all highlight the importance of effective and reliable welfare and pension programmes. The paper concludes that social welfare, poverty and inequality, slighted in China's race to growth, will confront it in the years to come.||Mark Selden

Ideas of free gifts of nature and control over nature dominate economic thought. This article presents an analysis of neo-classical thought in response to the ecological challenge, and enunciates the general principles of a new 'ecological economics'. It sees the macroeconomy as an open system with a unidirectional flow of entropy; suggests an accounting of environmental depreciation on the lines of capital depriciation; and proposes local-level collective control over natural resources.||Mihir Shah

Embankments under the MFCS have created a problem of waterlogging which damages crops, and the residents have no option but to breach the embankments.

In each case, the paper covers very briefly the background to and nature of the dispute, the approach to a resolution, the major features of the treaty, the manner in which it has been operating, the difficulties encountered, and how these can be resolved. It then sets forth some explanations and reflections that arise from these cases, including the complex interaction between water issues and political relations: the twin dangers of big-country insensitivity or arrogance and small-country pathology; the need to guard against a doctrinaire approach to the question of 'bilateralism' versus 'regionalism'; and the importance of not equating inter-country co-operation exclusively with a few large projects.||Ramaswamy R.
