As a result, while population has grown, agricultural productivity has not increased and resources have been degraded. Food availability has declined. A way out is to commercially use the biophysical features unique to the areas while protecting the environment.||Shantanu Nagpal

The present paper, based on empirical evidence, examines the scope of agricultural diversification by analysing various dimensions of the suggested alternative. It discusses prospects of the diversification alternative and its implication on employment, income, natural resources and ecology. An attempt is also made to propose future strategy for agricultural and economic development of Punjab in the post-green revolution period.||Ramesh Chand

Also an examination of media created 'messages' to dispel some of the myths about the movement, in particular, the question was Chipko about economics or deep ecology and was it feminist.||Jayanta Bandyopadhyay
04/9/1999-10/9/1999||perspectives||4408367||Beyond Growth and Globalisation||The early critique of undifferentiated, undirected growth, emerging from the north as well as the south, has been diluted over the years. The idea of 'sustainable development' co-opted social and environmental agendas into a mainstream now geared to market liberalisation and globalisation. It is time to reassess and join forces in a new critique of growth, and redefine progress.||Richard B. Norgaard

While the benefits of globalisation go to the seeds and chemical corporations through expanding markets, the cost and risks are exclusively born by the small farmers and landless peasants. While the commercial private seed supply system needs strong state regulation, farmer seed supply should function free of state interference with strong community control and public participation. Strong biosafety regulation with public participation is both a democratic and an ecological imperative.||Vandana Shiva,Ashok Emani,Afsar H. Jafri

The situation calls attention to the problems of commercial agriculture in the region and to the role of the state in inducing such conditions. Internal social complexities such as the growth of local usury and the increasing individualisation of agriculture also compound such distress.||A. R. Vasavi

Though the city does possess a criss-crossing structure of social web independent of the state, its citizens lack democratic trust in government agencies which remain inaccessible and unaccountable to their grievances. In such circumstances, the judiciary happens to be the only arm of government, providing rudimentary relief to citizens. Given the intransparency of the doings of other government agencies, the judiciary remains the only recourse to compel these agencies to function responsibly and thus stage a semblance of public sphere.||Hans Dembowski

Two types of measures need to be introduced in the short run to minimise environmental degradation and realise sustainable development: economic instrument and government regulation. China has endeavoured to introduce and implement environmental legislation and management with some success. However, the introduction of economic instruments can only be effective in the context of a perfect market system and legal framework. Although China's market-oriented reforms have made good progress, there are as yet many imperfections.||Luo Deming

Ideas of free gifts of nature and control over nature dominate economic thought. This article presents an analysis of neo-classical thought in response to the ecological challenge, and enunciates the general principles of a new 'ecological economics'. It sees the macroeconomy as an open system with a unidirectional flow of entropy; suggests an accounting of environmental depreciation on the lines of capital depriciation; and proposes local-level collective control over natural resources.||Mihir Shah

Apathy of the government machinery towards these environmental problems has provoked popular movements linked to people's access to natural resources and to health concerns. But an institutionalised approach to these problems is needed.||Ecological Economics Unit

This case study of Koyna sanctuary and the people of the area is such an attempt.||Milind S. Bokil
