Cited as the most important crop, the reason quoted by the farmers is its capacity to take care of basic food requirement of the family. But how far is it true? Is it pertinent to consider only the general aversion to risk-taking in rural area and consequently the preference of a safer rice-culture? Are there not other factors for its popularity? This empirical analysis along with the underlining logic, will enable us to formulate hypotheses regarding risks taken in a restrictive environment.||Veronique Alary

Moreover, in passing external assistance earmarked for the states, the central government makes a reduction in transfers it would have otherwise made to the states. From the country's perspective these fungibility results could be good; domestic spending priorities - inter-sectoral and inter-regional - are unaffected by foreign aid. For the donors, however, the results indicate that success of their projects, as measured by the conventional benefit-cost analysis, does not tell the whole story; the marginal use of their money and its overall development impact could be different from that intended.||Shikha Jha,Vinaya Swaroop

This article attempts to demonstrate that such prioritisation is conceptually flawed, particularly during this era of globalisation. This article argues that international relations is relatively insensitive to the question of justice, both on the diplomatic plane and within the mainstream scholarly discourse on the subject. Historically, the guiding principles of international relations have been stability, predictability and order at the cost of justice. The article argues that this legacy is among its 'original sins'. It also explores, in the context of the ongoing process of globalisation, the abiding continuity of some of the recurrent 'sins' of international relations and the implications of this continuity for critical security. Suggestions for remedial action follow logically from this analysis.||Aswini K. Ray

Based on a new data set that corresponds to the current border, we show a distinct turnaround at the time of partition in 1947 - the stagnant performance of agriculture in India and Pakistan during the colonial period was turned into a sustained growth since 1947, with a stronger performance in India especially in terms of per capita food production. Empirical investigation in this paper gives support to the view that institutional changes have significant effects on agricultural production in India and Pakistan. Farmers have responded to changes in institutions and policies, adjusting their crop mix and production technology.||Takashi Kurosaki

Institutions, for the present purpose, are defined as outcomes of the strategic interaction between members of the private sector and the monetary authorities. In a generalisation of the credit transmission approach we consider an aggregate monetary economy consisting of three agents: a firm, a bank and a household. The relationship between pairs of them is characterised by bilateral private information. Bonds, loans and savings are contracts in the level of output, the rate of interest on bonds, loans and the deposit rate. It is shown that the contracts have a common functional form. This renders the model dynamically unstable. We consider the potentially stabilising role of monetary policy in two cases. In the first, the monetary authority operates the discount window. Formally, we introduce a parameter in the objective functions of the private sector agents. In the second, the central bank enters as a player with the interest rate on government paper as a strategy. We examine the relative merits of the two policy regimes.||Romar Correa

A macro-level field study of the leather tanning industry in Tamil Nadu shows that gender subordination is built into the system.

Poverty of ideas in anthropology will be overcome if Indian practitioners learn to identify plethora of social problems afflicting Indian society, and operationalise and actualise ideas in response to them.||Biswanath Debnath

A perilous consequence of this trend is that instead of illuminating the functioning and dynamics of society and culture in particular and general terms, it confines itself to the question of policy prescription. By directing their energies to the 'issues of usefulness', anthropologists have come to think that the future survival of anthropology is incumbent upon its immediate market value. The future of anthropology can be enhanced, instead, by giving primacy to an interpretive understanding of societies and cultures, thereby making comments on existing policies for development and social justice more perceptive and relevant.||Vinay Kumar Srivastava

The traditional view considers that in the long run, domestic debt has a negative impact on economic growth while the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis implies the neutrality of domestic debt to growth. In India, domestic debt has been incurred mainly on the coinsideration that it shall be used for investment purposes. The issue is empirically examined using the cointegration test and the Granger causality test for India over the period 1959-95. Cointegration and the Granger causality tests support the Ricardian equivalence hypothesis between domestic debt and growth.||Charan Singh

The matter should be analysed at two levels. In order to understand the reality we have to ascertain the origin, evolution, and effects of caste. And to change the system we have to devise a strategy. For redressing the caste bias, a caste census is not necessary. A village presumably represents a small number (maybe, two or three) of adjacent castes. Then, the Human Development Index (HDI), computed village by village, can mimic the caste profile of the population. Such an index can help development-planning to eradicate, first, caste bias and then caste itself. A village-level version of the HDI can be used for an indirect estimate of caste bias, making the proposed caste census of 2001 redundant. The census instead should collect data on health, education, and earnings of the people.||Ranjit Sau

It studies the governance structure of inter-firm relationship as an interaction between various agents, including the role of policy. Based on a case study of Bhilai Steel Plant and its ancillaries, it is argued that the governance structure evolves in the process of interaction, determined by the responses of agents to policy. Further, the realisation of policy objectives depends on the decision-making process and responses of agents.

The WUAs have considerably improved the recovery of water charges thereby bringing revenue to the government.

The analysis is based on data published in the Economic Review of the government of West Bengal. This publication provides information on the number of new registrations and employment in such units by districts. Based on these data we first constructed time series of number of registered units and employment as on March 31, every year, and then calculated the growth rates of the two series, in alternative ways, separately for each district. The growth rates are obtained by fitting trend curves as well as by averaging year-to-year growth rates. Considerable interdistrict variations in growth rates are observed. Attempts have also been made to examine the inter-temporal districtwise variation in the absolute number of newly registered units and in their employment. No clear trend in the interdistrict disparity in this respect is noticeable.||Robin Mukherjee,Pranab Kumar Das,Uttam Kumar Bhattacharya

The literature distinguishes three competing models of the money supply process, namely, 'pure portfolio approach', 'pure loan demand approach' and 'mixed portfolio-loan demand approach'. While the first corresponds to the money multiplier approach, the latter two are the accommodative and structuralist views of money endogenenity of the post-Keynesian monetary theory. Using RBI monthly data, this study finds the endogenous nature of money supply in India where a paradigm of mixed portfolio loan model operates. It supports the structural approach implying that the policy stance of the monetary authority and private initiatives of banks are important in money supply determination.||Deba Prasad Rath

This has liberated them from the role of passive voter-supporter in the overall environment of subjugation and subordination, to actively shifting their traditional party loyalties in favour of new parties espousing their interests. If the SCs in varying degrees have deserted the Congress, in various states, the growing class differentiation amongst them has resulted in the lower class dalits opting for exclusively SC-based parties like the BSP, the Left Front or the left-of-the centre regional parties. Yet, as the CSDS survey shows, though political institutions of Indian democracy have gained support of the SCs, there has been a erosion of their confidence in the political parties. This alarmingly signals that the support extended by the dalits to the parliamentary system should not be taken for granted.||Pushpendra

The paper begins with discussion of auction design which is not really its focus. It merely underlines the possibilities and hindrances that exist towards taking up constructive design and evaluatory exercises that would make the process efficient. An efficiently functioning market sets the tone for transmission of policy signals to decision-making agents in the economy. It is in this context that the paper makes an attempt to model and understand the cut-off yield for T-Bills. The process is looked at from the point of view of the RBI, the merchant banker of the government and an independent monetary authority, it is also viewed from the point of view of the players in the market who demand these T-Bills. The exercise is conducted using co-integration technique and the OLS for the 14-day T-Bills. It is also argued that for evaluatory as well as forecasting/modelling exercises to be carried out, data gaps need to be eliminated. The paper ends by underlining the tentative nature of the research reported here and suggesting fruitful lines for further research in this area.||Abhay Pethe,Chiragra Chakrabarty

Acute large-scale famines, which used to occur periodically before independence, have now been eliminated. In spite of this, a large proportion of poor households across India does not have access to adequate food due to lack of purchasing power. About 35 per cent or around 325 million Indians are classified as 'poor'. Over 70 per cent of the family income in this category is spent to meet food and nutritional needs alone. The quinquennial consumer expenditure surveys of the NSSO make the estimation of the per capita intake of different food items and consequent supply of energy, proteins, fat, iron and calcium, possible. In this paper these estimates are presented at the all-India level according to expenditure class categories. According to this analysis food and nutrition deficiencies are much larger than what one would conceive by looking into poverty estimates.||Abusaleh Shariff,Ananta C. Mallick

Some economists argue that regulations by the government distorted the market mechanism and made import substitution industries profitable. In this view, investment has shifted from import substitution industries to export industries after deregulation and trade reforms. The article examines this view by comparing two industries: the machine tool industry, which is mainly an import-substitution industry; and the apparel industry, which is an export-oriented industry. As far as we can conclude from the ASI data, capital has not shifted from import substitution industries to export industries after economic reforms. It seems possible to suggest that industries supplying the domestic market, rather than export industries, contributed to increase in industrial production.||Shuji Uchikawa

The comparison questions whether the economic knowledge and the analytical methods used for planning and financing resettlement are adequate for achieving the goals of resettlement policy. Historically, research on involuntary resettlement has emerged primarily within the fields of anthropology and sociology. Economic research on displacement and resettlement, the author argues, is virtually missing - but would be indispensable to improving resettlement outcomes. The paper argues that the method of cost-benefit analysis, and the conventional project risk and sensitivity analyses used in projects entailing resettlement, are incapable of answering displacement's economic and financial challenges and in practice tolerate the structural underfinancing of resettlement operations. The author calls for a constructive "alliance" between economic and sociological knowledge on resettlement and argues that in-depth economic knowledge is indispensable to achieving two fundamental goals of resettlement policy: reduced displacement and development of resettlers' livelihoods, once they have moved.||Michael M.

Presently, privatisation, partnership arrangements and promotion of community-based projects have emerged as the only options for undertaking investments in basic amenities due to resource crunch in the government. This changed perspective and a consequent decline in public investment, however, are likely to accentuate the disparity in the levels of amenities across the size class of urban settlements.||Amitabh Kundu,Soumen Bagchi,Debolina Kundu

Contrary to the predictions of neoclassical growth theory that interstate differences in income levels tend to reduce as they approach the steady state equilibrium, our analysis shows widening interstate disparities. To understand the causes of this divergence, the article examines the determinants of interstate differences in growth rates and analyses the role of interstate transfers - explicit and invisible - in determining the geographical spread of investment and incomes. It finds that divergence in income levels has been mainly caused by the allocation of private investments which in turn, has been influenced by the inequitable spread of infrastructure. The inequitable nature of public expenditure spread across states is attributed to the inability of the intergovernmental transfer mechanism to adequately offset the fiscal disabilities of the poorer states as well as regressive nature of the invisible interstate transfers.||M.

Price stability is needed to create a stable and non-inflationary environment for resource allocation. Stable price expectations are necessary for long-term contracts. Successful inflation targeting requires credibility of the enforcing agency, usually the government and the central bank. Credibility in turn requires that the target be chosen carefully. This article reviews inflation targeting experience so far and analyses the issues related to it. It argues for developing an inflation model for India. Inflation targeting in India should wait until financial sector reform agenda is accomplished.||R. Kannan

It checks the validity of estimates for a few variables derived for 76 natural regions from the survey data with similar estimates based on the 1991 Census. After ensuring consistency between these estimates, regional variations in many important socio-economic characteristics - for which the NFHS is at present the only source - are studied through maps generated from a GIS software. The spatial patterns that emerge from this analysis highlight the limitations of state-specific models of demographic change, and provide some interesting evidence on much debated nexus between poverty, malnutrition and disease. The paper concludes with a presentation of survey data on health and living conditions in the slums of Delhi.||P. N. Mari Bhat,Francis Zavier

Its growth illustrates several intuitions of recent international literature on small firm dynamics. An export recession in 1996-98, however, showed that the growth had happened without basic changes in the technological and organisational capability of the industry. Using the example of an export-oriented weaving region, the paper describes the origin and presents conditions of the industry, its major handicaps, how it tries to address its handicaps, and what kind of policy initiatives may be needed to deal with them. The paper also suggests that some recent changes in organisation and technology in the industry can be seen as attempts to deal with these weaknesses.||Tirthankar Roy

The significance lies in the Samiti's women being the custodians of essential values and ideology of the RSS, which the other front of the latter have diluted and imperilled in their electoral preoccupations. And if at all the electoral battle is won, the Samiti women, being exemplars of purity and domesticity, will share along with their male counterparts of the RSS the bright future of Hindu rashtra as defenders of tradition against the west and partners in internal colonisation of Muslims and Christians.||Tanika Sarkar

With the erosion of rituality a large part of the support system of caste has collapsed. Caste now survives as a kinship-based cultural community but operates in a different newly emergent system of social stratification. By forming themselves into larger horizontal social groups, members of different castes now increasingly compete for entry into the middle class, changing its old pre-independence character and composition. This new and vastly enlarged middle class is becoming, even if slowly, politically and culturally more unified but highly diversified in terms of the social origins of its members.||D. L. Sheth

The black economy should, therefore, have been a significant factor in analyses of the economy. Its non-inclusion in analyses resulted in a partial understanding of the Indian economy and often incorrect policy pronouncements. This paper describes the institutional practices of the black economy and incorporates it into the short run macro analysis of the Indian economy. The need to incorporate the black economy is not simply an empirical matter, but a theoretical necessity. The circular flow of incomes changes with the black economy. Black incomes are first defined. Transfers are not included, but their implications for national incomes, savings and velocity of circulation are presented. The theoretical analysis yields counter intuitive results with regard to tax evasion, investment and savings, subsidies, balance of payments, etc. The empirical trends since the 1970s, say, with regard to unemployment, inflation, the fiscal gap, current account deficit or investments and savings can be better explained using this framework.||Arun Kumar

Since membership of a caste group was not a voluntary choice, but determined by birth and hence a coercive association, the liberal view of the self as a totally unencumbered and radically free subject seemed plagued with difficulties. Though the nation state envisages a political community co-extensive with one cultural community, it need not, Ambedkar argued, necessarily lead to abolition of discriminatory caste practices in civil society. To restore the cultural rights of stigmatised populations, unredeemed by the nation state, propelled Ambedkar to seek solution in Buddhism.||Vidhu Verma

The online content scenario in south Asia is reviewed along dimensions of number of Web sites, local relevance, community involvement, directories, search engines, ad revenues, and third party audits. In the south Asian context, despite regional variations, the status of online content still leaves a lot to be desired along these dimensions. Content will continue to play as important a role as infrastructure in making the Internet a useful tool for individuals and organisations. The paper concludes with a set of policy recommendations for enhancing the growth of local content in south Asia.||Madanmohan Rao,Imran Rashid,Hasan Rizvi,Rajib Subba

The econometric model applied explains for a substantial proportion of the cross-country variations in child labour. The elasticities estimated would enable us to forecast the percentage change in the employment of child labour resulting from a given percentage change in any one of the explanatory variables consisting of the level of development (GNP per capita), poverty, income inequality, school enrolment, parental education, dominance of agriculture and age structure of the population. The range of policy options for combating child labour is indeed large and the weights to be attached to the individual elements of the socio-economic policy package are clearly guided by the explanatory power of each of the above causal factors.||Iftikhar Ahmed

Despite transferring the administration of schools to the panchayats, the scheme has failed to generate in parents and the panchayats an active demand in terms of supervising and supporting the school, taking an interest in the teaching-learning process and thinking about educational issues. This relative passivity of parents and panchayats, despite decentralisation and community control of schools, do not augur significant change for the school system and the teacher as yet.||Rashmi Sharma

12/6/1999-18/6/1999||special article||4408079||Liquidity Effects on Term Structure of Government Securities: Some Evidence on Market Integration||An empirical examination of the term structure of interest rates in the Indian economy suggests cointegration (or long run stable relationship) among interest rates but existence of multiple common trends. The absence of a unique common trend implies that long run movements of any one interest rate are not dominated by the movements of the other interest rates. The presence of cointegration, however, suggests a long run interlocking of interest rates across markets and a possibility of their common response to changes in expectations about future monetary policy and/or economic fundamentals. The interrelationship between transitory (cyclical) components of interest rates reveals that yields, especially, of dated government of India (GOI) securities became closely aligned to money market conditions beginning from the second half of the calendar year 1996. Since short-term transitory components often stem from policy impulses, the closer synchronisation of the said yields with call money rates observed during this period could, perhaps, be attributed to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) decisions to integrate the two markets by allowing primary dealers to participate in the interbank call money market.||Himanshu Joshi

This paper presents the findings of a formal attempt to explain inter-bank variations in NPAs for the year 1996-97. The specification tests for the impact of region of operation on domestically-owned banks, as measured by percentage branches in each of a set of state clusters. One cluster of three eastern and seven north-eastern states carries a robust and statistically significant positive coefficient; another cluster of the southern and some of the northern states carries a significantly negative coefficient. These findings bear out those of Demirguc-Kunt and Huizinga on the significance of the operating environment for bank efficiency. No sustainable improvement in the performing efficiency of domestic banks is possible without prior improvement in the enforcement environment in difficult regions of the country. Another finding of some importance is that it is not foreign ownership in and of itself so much as the banking efficiency and technology correlates of the country of origin of the foreign bank which determine NPA performance in the Indian environment.||Indira Rajaraman,Sumon Bhaumik,Namita Bhatia

But does India need that sort of a regime? In thoughts as well as in actions, the reign of this particular liberal consensus for about half a century has exacerbated social fragmentation, religious intolerance, and economic underdevelopment. There is no sign of change for the better in this consensus. The conservative consensus differs little from its rival. It invokes Hindu epics, which, in fact, glorify civil wars that had divided the people. The epic age of Indian spiritualism is marked by great diversity of thoughts which cannot possibly be contained within any one culture. And the other beliefs that emerged subsequently deserve no less respect. The conservative agenda is thus incoherent. Communalism and casteism are the two main threats today. The basic problem has two dimensions: inter-religion, and intra-religion. This paper suggests a possibility of resolution, inspired by two universal truths, namely, human sanctity, and human rights; the former justifies the domain, while the latter enumerates the content. The first one is an ancient revelation in all religions; the second one is of recent origin. The basic ideals of India include secularism and equality in the civil society, full employment and growth in the economy, and democracy in polity. This paper tests the prevailing conservative and liberal consensus in the light of such standards. And, above all, it explores a possible path towards these ideals.||Ranjit Sau

This article argues that the Dangi's 'vadilcha goth' or tales about ancestors are an engagement with modernity and its paradigmatic trope, history. The subaltern practice of anomalous and hybrid histories, in the Dangs, produces a multiplicity of pasts quite different from those multiple histories which historians conceive of and increasingly call for.||Ajay Skaria

Firstly, such a regime clashes with the 1993 convention on biodiversity wherein 170 countries have upheld the need for diversity. Secondly, the increasing patenting of life forms in the developing countries by the MNCs under the pretext of bio-prospecting will lead to a patent regime overwhelmingly in favour of the developed countries. Moreover the 20-year period of product patent rights together with the monopoly marketing rights eliminates the possibility of competing with the MNCs on equal footing.

In all cases, restructuring revolved around the economic and institutional organisation of the sector and the advantages of introducing competition to raise the overall efficiency in the sector. In India, the reforms already initiated, at the federal level, have been the enactment of laws which enable setting up of regulatory commissions at the central and state levels; provide for separation of generation and transmission as distinct activities; recognise central and state transmission utilities as government companies; allow setting up of private transmission lines within the overall supervision of operation of the government transmission utility; and provide for regulation of transmission by the central and state regulators. Orissa and Haryana had initiated reforms before central legislation and others followed later. This paper attempts to study the initiatives taken in different parts of the world and the benefits of restructuring wherever visible. For India, the paper studies the present stage of restructuring and identifies the programme for the future.||Pradip Baijal

Failure to contain wasteful expenditure and reluctance to raise additional resources on the part of the states are the main causes. Tax wars among state governments to attract private investments in the wake of economic reforms as well as competitive populism on the part of ruling parties and contenders for power led to this. The last blow has been the pay revision of employees forced upon the state governments by the centre's unilateral decision to implement Fifth Pay Commission Report. Consequently, states are starved of funds to meet the essential investment needs in social and infrastructure sectors. Large borrowings are resorted to by several states just to meet the current expenditure. Almost all the indicators of fiscal health of the state economies are steadily deteriorating. The paper reaches the conclusion that unless drastic measures to correct the situation are resorted to without delay, finances of several states will collapse.||N. J. Kurian

However, although several plants are under construction, till early 1999, generation had commenced at private plants totalling less than 2,000 MW. In contrast, some state undertakings have completed their projects even earlier than scheduled. Independent power producers (IPPs) claim that their progress has been hindered by problems such as litigation, financial arrangements, and obtaining clearances and fuel supply agreements. On the other hand, the state electricity boards have been burdened by power purchase agreements (PPAs) that favour the IPPs with such clauses as availability payment irrespective of plant utilisation, tariffs reflecting high capital costs and returns on equity, etc. The process of inviting private participation in the power sector and the problems experienced seem to have spurred on the restructuring of the power sector, including the formation of Central and State Electricity Regulatory Commissions. However, some important problems have not been addressed. Additions to the generation capacity without corresponding improvement of the transmission and distribution facilities is likely to further undermine the system efficiency. What is more, issues like the reduction of 'commercial losses' appear to have been ignored. Most importantly, investment in infrastructure has been a state responsibility because the intrinsically long gestation coupled with the relatively low returns from serving all categories of consumers have rendered such projects commercially unprofitable. Whether or not private participation can take on such tasks is to be seen.||Antonette D'Sa,K. V. Narasimha Murthy,Amulya K. N. Reddy

It uses this information to assess the performance on these outcomes of India relative to other countries and of individual Indian states relative to the all-India average. The paper's main conclusions are: (i) While income does have some influence on health outcomes, technical progress and other factors are substantially more important. Less than a quarter of India's dramatic reductions in IMR and TFR between 1975 and 1990 can be explained by income growth. (ii) India's performance on IMR falls short of what would be expected given results of other countries of its income. (iii) By contrast, India's performance in reducing TFR is substantially better than would be predicted from its income. (iv) Not surprisingly states vary substantially in the performance relative to their income level and the all-India average values of IMR and TFR.||Anthony R. Measham,Krishna D. Rao,Dean T.

Hindutva's chances of holding state power more securely lie in a more complete hegemonisation of this now overwhelmingly capitalist class. Hindutva pursues this political aim in part by adapting its hitherto excessively shrill and narrowly petty bourgeois ideology to the more settled nature, proclivities and imperatives of the ruling class.

The variation is also depended on whether the firms want to be market leaders, followers or imitators. Depending upon the firm's strategy, efforts are made to build the firm's absorptive capacity. Tiny firms operate basically at the lower end of technology and hence learning is at the operational level and efforts are not made to retain humanpower. The linkage has, however, resulted in learning on productivity improvement through time, inventory and resource management. The firms that have joint ventures with buyers make special efforts to train and retain humanpower. They also have technological collaborations with world market leaders in their respective fields.||N. Mrinalini,G. D. Sandhya

The author concludes that the neoliberal regime in India has so far failed to improve the macro-economic management of the economy and to achieve a better level of macro-economic capability.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

Certain rigidities within the coal sector as also in the macro-economic environment imply that the gains of economic liberalisation can only be consolidated through the creation of a regulatory agency. This experience is not unique to India. Even mature market-oriented economies have come to accept the utility of regulatory agencies in simulating competitive conditions under less than perfect free market conditions. This paper seeks to sketch the outlines of an ideal regulatory mechanism based on the experiences of other economies which have gone through the process of liberalisation/privatisation in the recent past and, against that background, to set out a proposal for a regulatory body for the Indian coal sector, keeping the specific conditions and requirements of producers and consumers in view.||Suchitra Sengupta

This paper uses four sets of pooled equations for predicting stable levels of per capita consumption of rice and wheat in physical terms in rural and urban India. Foodgrain demand and the own-price, cross price and income elasticities of demand are estimated for all states. A formula that is based on the concept of subsidising real consumption through PDS is proposed.||Raghbendra Jha,K. V. Bhanu Murthy,Hari K. Nagarajan,Ashok K. Seth

China has embarked on attaining self-sufficiency in urea production. They consider this strategy crucial for attaining self-sufficiency in grain production. This is also part of their modernisation plan of the domestic fertiliser industry. This article (which is a sequel to another special article published in January 9, 1999 issue of the EPW entitled 'New Fertiliser Policy: A Practical Approach') studies the Chinese policy and its implications for the policy of India on expanding the domestic production capacity. The paper calls for a rational approach to the issue of domestic production after taking a considered view on the various aspects related to it.||Sanjay Kumar

However, since 1970s the share of the secondary sector in the State Domestic Product has been stagnating around 33 to 34 per cent. Further, the state is experiencing significant changes in the industrial composition wherein capital and intermediate goods industries are becoming dominant. The manufacturing sector is itself undergoing major structural changes. Over the period 1979-80 to 1994-95 the state realised a high growth rate in fixed capital resulting in decrease in employment. The rising capital intensity and thereby substitution of capital for labour, low growth rates of output and value added, all do not indicate satisfactory performance of the state on the industrial front. However, there is a revival in the manufacturing sector in post-reform period.||L. G. Burange

Till 1997 the PDS was a more or less universal programme, which distributed food to rich and poor cardholders alike. This universal set-up changed in 1997, when the government of India introduced targeting. The implementation of targeting proved, however, difficult. Based on fieldwork in two Indian states, Karnataka and Bihar, the paper discusses some of these difficulties. In particular, it focuses on some misconceptions and wrong assumptions underlying the introduction of the targeted PDS. Politicians and policy-makers have overlooked vested interests and institutional constraints, which often make it impossible or at least very difficult to implement the policies as they were meant to be implemented. The paper argues that policy discussions are insufficiently grounded in the day-to-day political and bureaucratic realities at the state and local level, and that this is, in part, related to the institutional organisation of the policy-making process itself.||Jos Mooij

For a developing economy like India where it is of utmost importance that limited resources be efficiently channelised, elections held at such frequent intervals impose a heavy cost. In addition to the large visible cost of campaign expenses and expenses incurred in its administration, there is a large hidden cost on account of the fact that politicians make every attempt to appease various lobbies around election years.

Moreover, the Morley-Minto reforms of 1909, which aimed to restore faith in the representativeness of the colonial state and thus with over the moderates within the Congress, also instituted representative politics in terms of Hindu and Muslim identities. It was this legitimacy given to religious identities which, the paper argues, spawned Hindu nationalism as reflected in the Hindu Subhas in Punjab, who, as against the Congress extremists' call for boycott of representative politics, argued for Hindu unity so as to enforce greater representation of Hindus in legislative bodies.||John Zavos

Data on 84 three-digit industries within the organised manufacturing sector is used here. An index of subcontracting intensity is introduced and it is shown to have increased in aggregate manufacturing between 1970 and 1992-93. It is shown that subcontracting practices are concentrated in labour-intensive industries and greater in industries producing consumer non-durables.

Though the city does possess a criss-crossing structure of social web independent of the state, its citizens lack democratic trust in government agencies which remain inaccessible and unaccountable to their grievances. In such circumstances, the judiciary happens to be the only arm of government, providing rudimentary relief to citizens. Given the intransparency of the doings of other government agencies, the judiciary remains the only recourse to compel these agencies to function responsibly and thus stage a semblance of public sphere.||Hans Dembowski

This intolerance that puts the blame on readily identifiable scapegoats - the religious minorities for instance - provides fertile ground for the seeds of communalism and majoritarianism. The net result is that the nation has been narrated in a new model - that of majoritarianism that serves to exclude rather than include, marginalise rather than integrate, and keep out rather than embody large sections of its own inhabitants.||Neera Chandhoke

The results of the investigation indicate: (i) so far as the function of domestic savings mobilisation is concerned, Indian stock market development from the 1980s onwards has not played a prominent role, (ii) if there is further deregulation of the stock market to attract more foreign portfolio inflows into India, there seems to be no way to avoid similar problems as Mexico, Korea and Thailand, such as more volatile movement of domestic stock prices and unstable BoP positions, (iii) bank credit to the commercial sector has no positive correlationship with indicators of stock market development.

The regulatory climate in south Asia has only recently welcomed private sector ISPs, but a key challenge lies in creating a level playing field between government-owned and private sector ISPs. Work has begun on initiatives to extend the Net beyond urban concentrations to rural areas via Internet kiosks, community centres, wireless delivery and non-PC devices, but much innovation and investment is still called for here. From the ability to improve software and education to boosting handicrafts and human rights, the Net has a lot to offer to a wide array of humanity in south Asia. But without a progressive ISP environment, the Internet will continue to exacerbate the digital divide between rural and urban, non-English and English-speaking south Asia.||Madanmohan Rao,Sanjib Raj Bhandari,S.

In this paper, I first examine the volume of the food subsidy over the last three decades. Secondly, using data for the 1990s from the accounts of the Food Corporation of India (FCI), I examine the components of the foodgrain subsidy, the relative contribution of different components to total costs, and the growth in different components during the current decade. Thirdly, I attempt to compare the efficiency of the FCI with that of private trade. The data from FCI performance budgets show clearly that the increase in procurement price was a critical factor in the increase in economic costs of rice and wheat. The procurement price, however, is a variable over which the FCI has no control as the central government sets the procurement price based on the recommendations of the Commission on Agricultural Costs and Prices. Despite the absolute increase in many components of costs, there was an improvement in the operational efficiency of the FCI during the 1990s. Lastly, no unambiguous finding emerged from a comparison of wholesale market prices and economic costs of the FCI. The FCI compared favourably with private traders in the distribution of rice in a large number of states. In the states of northern and central India, however, private traders had lower prices for grain. The presence of systematic rural-urban price differences indicated the imperfections of grain markets.||Madhura Swaminathan

Yet, recent decades have also brought dismantling of community-based health and welfare programmes, with no discernable progress in extension of universal social security to the countryside. Rapid increases in absolute and relative population above age of 60, rising dependency ratios in which a shrinking labouring class must support the aged and infirm, and galloping inequality that threatens to make China's income distribution the most unequal in the world, all highlight the importance of effective and reliable welfare and pension programmes. The paper concludes that social welfare, poverty and inequality, slighted in China's race to growth, will confront it in the years to come.||Mark Selden

In an era of increasing regional identities, there is need to understand the determinants of regional economic growth. A critical examination of the relationship between public policies and regional economic growth is provided in this paper. The main lesson that emerges from the review of regional development literature is that a single incentive or development activity cannot lead to programme or project success. The empirical analysis tests the efficacy of public infrastructure investments in the development process of 15 Indian states. The empirical analysis highlights that investments in social infrastructure have the closest linkage with economic growth across lagging, intermediate, and leading states. The empirical research suggests that the composition of public investments is important in facilitating growth, and public investment is a necessary but not sufficient condition for regional economic growth. Sensitivity towards scale and spatial issues, model specification and development of conceptual linkages should be central to future work on infrastructure productivity.||Somik V. Lall

In the scenario of liberalised external trade in foodgrains, we examine the cost effectiveness of variable levies on trade as an alternative option to stabilise domestic prices. We find that the use of variable levies is much more effective in stabilising prices and reducing food insecurity as compared to buffer stocks. Buffer stock operations are also found to be less effective in reducing food insecurity under free trade as compared to the case of autarky or no trade.||P. V. Srinivasan,Shikha Jha

In such a context, we have identified many important empirical patterns and regularities, notably the existence of business cycles, the counter-cyclical nature of inflation, the twin deficits problem, the impact of absorption on reserves, the evolution of the debt-income ratio, the relationship between real interest rates and growth, the sustainability of the fiscal stance, amongst others, which could act as theoretical guideposts for the formulation of issues in the role and conduct of macro-economic stabilisation policy.||M.

The distances involved are modest, and techno-economic viability appears straightforward. This paper examines in detail the policy, technology, and economics of an overland pipeline supplying natural gas to Pakistan and India. Such a pipeline would be shared by both countries, and would represent a unique opportunity for co-operation. As pipelines exhibit significant economies of scale, shared pipeline would offer the lowest price natural gas for both countries. Pakistani consumers would obtain cheaper gas than from a lower capacity pipeline for their exclusive use, also benefiting from transit fees paid by Indian consumers. An alternative to land-based pipelines through Pakistan for India would be liquefied natural gas, which is more expensive due to the capital-intensive nature of the liquefaction process. However, any overland gas pipeline does not depend solely on economic viability, but on political acceptance as well. This study addresses some of the potential concerns, briefly discussing options for overcoming security of supply worries. Through co-operating on such a venture, one that offers the promise of significantly helping to build the infrastructure of both countries, there is the possibility of the neighbouring countries becoming partners in progress, instead of languishing as prisoners of geography.||Rahul Tongia,V.

If the infrastructure design does not meet the requirements of pedestrians, bicyclists and non-motorised rickshaws, all modes of transport operate in sub-optimal conditions. However, re-designing existing roads will not only provide a safer and convenient environment for non-motorised modes, it will also improve efficiency of public transport vehicles and enhance the capacity of the corridor when measured in number of passengers transported per hour per lane.||Dinesh Mohan,Geetam Tiwari

However, the term 'competitiveness' necessitates a much wider landscape than merely ensuring free markets. It indicates the capabilities of a firm or a sector or a nation to compete successfully. Analysis shows that there are no systematic efforts to build capabilities and hence enhance the competitiveness after liberalisation.

It relates FDI flows to changing industrial structure and to trade flows. An econometric analysis is done to identify key determinants of FDI flows to Asian countries. Japan has been the main source of FDI flows to Asia. Japanese FDI has helped cost reduction and export promotion in the host countries. But, in the process, Japan has created a large trade surplus with these countries.||Bishwanath Goldar,Etsuro Ishigami

This paper, based on an analysis of Singapore's experience, offers several suggestions for economies contemplating a move from non-contributory to contributory fully funded schemes. While pre-funding of retirement financing is desirable, to ensure intended results, it is essential to give considerable attention to design, implementation, and regulatory issues. In particular, great care needs to be exercised in undertaking the investment of accumulated funds in a prudent, yet remunerative manner.||Mukul G. Asher

This premise is crucial to our treatment of the budget. Looking at the statistics and arithmetic in the budget for 1999-2000, the general impression which emerges is that the budget allocations do not conform with many of the commitments of the budget speech, particularly in the case of economic services - agriculture, irrigation, rural development and industries. For social services, however, the budget does seem to promise a somewhat better package. Of the lessons that need to be learnt and which are very much hinted at in the budget, viz, learn to let go and learn to pay, are of essence. Internalising especially the last of these lessons by the principals (the public) involves facing and resolving contradictions in their own actions. Unless we stop pointing fingers and realise that there is no free lunch to be had, no budget, however well formulated, can really achieve anything.||Abhay Pethe,Mala Lalvani

The Jesuit scientists of the period were inaugurators of a discourse on India and Indian historical astronomy marked by ambiguity, where fascination and dismissal so together; where the enchantment with the new world and its distinct knowledge forms provide the occasion for enriching the self in cognitive and cultural terms, and through an act of distantiation, of redefining the self as superior.||Dhruv Raina

Oppressed Castes in Politics||Among the oppressed the appeal to caste is for unification of similar 'jatis' into larger collectivities and political mobilisation for power so as to subvert the very relations of the 'varna' order. Caste appeal here is, therefore, far from being casteism. On the other hand, the self-perceived transcendence of the traditionally hegemonic middle class from caste consciousness has rapidly collapsed in the last decade. There has been a steady decomposition of the consciousness of the middle class into articulated caste interests of brahmins, thakurs and so on. Within the Muslim communities there has been a shift away from concerns of security to those of equality and dignity - a politics in affinity to that of the dalits and the OBCs for recognition. They are therefore no more a vote bank; it is a case of alignment of interests of a secular nature, a social coalition of oppressed forces. This fusion of opposite tendencies and intercession of contrary forces has rendered the process of democratisation more and more complicated so that simple judgments become one-sided and are a sure source of misunderstanding.||Javeed Alam

The applicability of the neoclassical and Marxist approaches to the study of interlocked factor markets is examined with empirical data collected from three villages through an intensive survey. It is argued that the Marxist approach is more powerful in studying interlinkage as it addresses the problem in the context of a differentiated class society. However, the autonomous role of class relations should not be overstressed. The macro variables that shape class relations and the enforcement device of the dominant class are to be given due recognition. This article appears in two parts. This, the first part, analyses features of tenancy prevailing in the survey area and explores causes for the existence of tenancy and its persistence.||Mamata Swain

Whatever route Indian firms take to deal with competition from MNCs, it is imperative for them to keep track of global strategies of these firms. Often the strategies undertaken at the local level are only part of the global strategies, because it is difficult for any firm to allow significant differences in approach in different markets. After the second coming of the international varieties of Cola drinks, the market has witnessed a high-profile tussle between the global giants - Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. This tussle and the respective problems faced by the two firms in the Indian market are extremely instructive. This paper argues that the events in the Indian soft drinks market can only be explained with reference to the global fight between Coke and Pepsi and their respective global strategies. Moreover, these two firms are so dissimilar that their relative successes and failures can throw light on some of the important issues in industrial organisation.||Arijit Biswas,Anindya Sen

Moreover, by asserting that the living standards of the oustees were better in the resettlement sites, the reports evidently consider market-determined monetary values as the norm of 'development' against which the original villages, with their non-monetised inputs of production and consumption, constitute a lack of 'modernity'. On the other hand, the qualitative fieldwork based information reporting conducted by the author at the selective resettlement sites reveals immiserisation of formerly self-sufficient adivasi societies, and creation of new labour nomads in south and central Gujarat.||J.

This politics of pragmatism makes party ideology almost irrelevant. But voters do support parties on the basis of their policies. The MGP has not been able to translate its 'bahujan' ideology into votes and seats. The BJP has offered a softer version of hindutva than elsewhere in the country, but has not found many takers. The Congress is in a relatively strong position, but voters are unhappy with its unashamed practice of 'pragmatic' politics.||Peter Ronald deSouza

Empowerment through the class struggle was a different story altogether; but that story has now been played out and it offers hardly any new prospect. There is no doubt the prospect of empowerment through caste war; but that is something that will appeal only to those who have put their minds to sleep. So in the end, the Indian way of securing empowerment for the unempowered seems to be by the safe way of providing, as extensively as possible, quotas on the basis of community, caste and gender. But can the belief that quotas, no matter how extensive, can by themselves bring about a radical or even a perceptible redistribution of power be anything more than wishful thinking?||Andre Beteille

Is this true in the Indian case? This article examines statistical evidence to answer this question. It finds that since liberalisation, trade has shrunk India's manufacturing base both in terms of value addition and employment. The intermediate and capital goods industries have suffered more. Manufacturing is also shifting from high-skilled and capital intensive production to low-skilled and labour intensive production. Existing wage disparity between skilled and unskilled workers has worsened.||R. G. Nambiar,B. L. Mungekar,G. A. Tadas

The state now has a two-party system, mainly at the cost of the Congress. The traditional social support bases of the Congress have been either won over or neutralised by the BJP. Gujarat's electoral experience shows the gradual and then sudden rise of the BJP, its split and decline in 1997 and re-emergence in 1998. While both the major parties are ridden by factional fighting, the lesson the voters appear to have drawn is that even a disciplined and committed party like the BJP goes the Congress way when in power.||Priyavadan Patel
09/10/1999-15/10/1999||special articles||4408506||Is Poverty Now a Permanent Phenomenon in Pakistan?||Around mid-1990s, there was growing awareness and recognition that after two decades of poverty reduction, these positive trends had either slowed down, or worse still, had been reversed. Many studies which analysed and explained these trends, argued that poverty in Pakistan had been reduced due to a combination of factors, including high and sustained growth over a fairly long period of time, by the role and contribution made by remittances from the West Asia, and by a public policy which was not so much focused upon poverty alleviation per se, but dependent more on overall government spending. Since 1988, when the government started following an IMF and World Bank structural adjustment programme, almost every single macro-economic indicator with some poverty reducing impact, began to worsen. Over the last decade, growth has slowed down markedly, development and social sector spending has been slashed, inflation has increased, manufacturing sector growth has been exceptionally low, and remittances have fallen to their lowest levels in 20 years. Hence, all the factors which may have had a positive influence on poverty alleviation, have deteriorated, possibly explaining why poverty returned to Pakistan and why it has continued to persist. With every government committed to such a stabilisation and restructuring programme, and with its own poor record of targeting for poverty alleviation, it is more than likely that poverty in Pakistan is going to grow and persist well into the future.||S.

It first pinpoints the essential features of that conflict, stressing that the problem has both exogenous sources in the form of the broader regional conflict between India and Pakistan, and endogenous sources, in the form of the existence of several fundamentally different political allegiances and preferences among the socially heterogenous population of Kashmir. It also explains why neither plebiscite nor partition present viable means of resolving the Kashmir conundrum, using analogies and examples from Bosnia-Hercegovina and Quebec in the process. The article then develops one by one three interlocking dimensions of an alternative peace-building approach which takes account of the complex intersection of multiple, cumulating 'domestic' and 'international' factors that collectively define the contemporary Kashmir problem. This three-track approach is inspired by the ongoing strategy of building peace in northern Ireland and derives much of its substance from the central aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. The approach takes into account the legitimate concerns of Indian and Pakistani state elites with basic issues of territorial sovereignty, national interests and security, while accommodating the equally legitimate aspiration to self-rule of a large segment of the population of Kashmir.||Sumantra Bose

In each case, the paper covers very briefly the background to and nature of the dispute, the approach to a resolution, the major features of the treaty, the manner in which it has been operating, the difficulties encountered, and how these can be resolved. It then sets forth some explanations and reflections that arise from these cases, including the complex interaction between water issues and political relations: the twin dangers of big-country insensitivity or arrogance and small-country pathology; the need to guard against a doctrinaire approach to the question of 'bilateralism' versus 'regionalism'; and the importance of not equating inter-country co-operation exclusively with a few large projects.||Ramaswamy R.

Those who stop studying after school are not equipped to work in the rural or the urban sectors. Too high a proportion goes on to college and add to the numbers of the educated employed. Vocational training, which has been neglected in India, could prepare students for work in the large unorganised sector of the economy.

The need for private sector entry has been justified on the basis of enhancing the efficiency of operations, achieving a greater density and penetration of life insurance in the country, and for a greater mobilisation of long-term savings for long gestation infrastructure projects. In the wake of such coming competition, the LIC, with its 40 years of experience and wide reach, is in an advantageous position. However, unless it addresses strategic issues such as changing demography and demand for pensions, demand for a wider variety of products, and having greater freedom in its investments, LIC may find it difficult to adapt to liberalised scenario.||Ajit Ranade,Rajeev Ahuja

Its implication for competition will be significant. Countries that have already put competition policies in place and firms that have been improving their capabilities are the ones that are going to benefit the most. This paper discusses the nature of competition that Indian textile firms are going to face domestically and abroad in a few years from now. Some of the characteristics of competitive firms that will emerge in the ensuing period are indicated. The paper presents a summary of comparison of Indian primary textile firms with those of China and Canada (based on a primary plant level survey in the three countries). In addition, some processes that are helping the Chinese textile industry grow rapidly are discussed. It is argued that competitiveness of Indian firms would be contingent on developing long-term distinctive capabilities. Three key strategies, namely, Commitment, Co-ordination and Co-operation, for developing distinctive capabilities are presented and illustrations of initiatives at the firm level, industry level and the government level that would form part of the implementation package for each strategy are provided.||Pankaj Chandra

While largesses offered to rural areas and farmers alienated urban and non-agriculturist votes, the non-materialisation of such manna angered the disappointed would-be-beneficiaries. Corruption was also an issue though there was little to choose between the two rivals on that score.

The BSP undoubtedly has instilled self-respect among the UP dalits through its strategy of single-mindedly pursuing electoral power.

But it has done little, despite an abundance of promises, to confront the structures and processes responsible for the poverty of the masses. No progress in human development is possible without a determined attack on these structures and processes. This paper describes the marginalisation process operating in agriculture and suggests that the process is likely to get intensified in the coming years. It is also argued that all the major determinants - the policy environment, the markets and modernised agriculture - tend to bypass the poor rather than work towards their development. The paper concludes with a brief description of a recent successful case of self-reliant development of a village community and its implications for interventions by NGOs and activists.||V. M. Rao,H.

The tenacity of ethnicity and finely differentiated versions of south Slav nationalism, sharpened by frequent foreign imperial dominations of the region in the past, defeated Tito's design as well as international efforts to save Yugoslavia from Balkanisation. Instead of integrating the eight ethnic groups comprising Yugoslavia into a single nation, certain political and economic dynamics of the federal system tended to unintentionally reinforce ethnic nationalism within each federal unit, especially the larger and more assertive ones. The serbian domination of the state power structure, unwarranted by population size or economic strength, provoked the assertion of non-serbian ethnic identities. If the croats and the slovenes succeeded in achieving a state and an economy of their own within the parameters of a nation, the Bosnian Muslims and the Kosovo Albanians became victims of the serbian repression unleashed against them.||Dawa Norbu

It is these alternatives that this paper seeks to explore. It considers not just algorithm of numbers but their philosophical foundations. Since algorithms and axioms are finally based on philosophical ground beliefs, it is only by analysis of these beliefs that clarity can be achieved for alternative conceptions. Before discussing the Indian views and their consequences, it first states the general problems about numbers posed by the western tradition for which solutions have been sought and discusses the attempted solutions to the important problems. It is only in the light of this that the Indian alternative can be properly appreciated.||Chhatrapati Singh

Most new employment must be in small and medium enterprises, which have achieved some of these things elsewhere. Reviewed here are policies tried in India and elsewhere: protectionism plus privileges for small firms; 'real services' to promote flexible specialisation (Italy, Spain); long-term relationships between large firms and subcontractors (Japan); liberalisation to the limit (Britain, the US); education and training; promoting entrepreneurship, etc. Recent work on industrial districts suggests that Indian variants of flexible specialisation are emerging and can be promoted by suitable policies.||Mark Holmstrom

But though that statement is not true even of the urban economy, when the rural economy is brought into the picture, the role of the domestic economy and of women within it are both sharply brought out. In order to comprehend the rural dimensions of the Asian crisis, the authors take the example of Thailand, with some supplementary material from Malaysia and Indonesia.||Dev Nathan,Govind Kelkar

High-yielding varieties (HYVs) of sugarcane were introduced to certain parts of the district in the late 1970s and early 1980s which has dramatically increased yields of cane per acre. The empirical study is focused on a region which is generally associated with the development of capitalist farming, on the assumption that any proposition which could be proved for these areas is likely to hold for other regions undergoing similar processes of change. We analyse the various impacts of 'new technology' on two different villages and examine the resultant changes at the household level. The study examines the effects of the 'new technology' on process of differentiation of the 120 sample households. A clear picture emerges that capitalist farming is expanding and economic differentiation is increasing.||Kalim Siddiqui

The second half of the 20th century is characterised by a loss of faith in the institutions of the state and looks towards civil society to preserve essential human and democratic rights. As against this, the paper advocates a return to an earlier rights-based conception of civility by enforcing universal laws through the instrument of the state. Since the state alone can create conditions necessary to protect the institutions of civil society from internal disruptions, the paper argues against detachment of civil society from the state. Instead, the institutions of civil society are very much part of democratic constitutional state, which alone will ensure social equality and non-discrimination along with individual liberty.||Gurpreet Mahajan

More recently, infrastructural problems, among other developments, have prompted the reopening of the long-standing debate on the sustainability of this growth, which is examined in this paper from the perspective of high technology organisations that have been driving formal job creation in the recent past. Presented here are four short case studies of companies active in the field of information technology and services: one a large-scale public sector enterprise; three indigenous firms that originated as small-scale enterprises and two companies started by multinational corporations. The studies demonstrate the new challenges facing these companies and the consequences of the ongoing shift from an older paradigm of state intervention toward the new paradigm of entitled liberalisation.||James Heitzman

Some are highly quantitative, others rely more heavily on verbal description. In a relatively few cases the same village or set of villages has been restudied, and in one extreme case over a span of nearly 150 years. After briefly surveying some of the most useful of these longitudinal studies, the author describes in some detail his own 27-year study of a set of four Badaga villages in the Nilgiri Hills of Tamil Nadu. All were clustered together, but represented different phratries and social strata in this traditionally peasant millet-farming community of 1,60,000 people. Some conclusions are drawn about the nature of modernisation here, and evidence is produced to suggest that the process - which involves universal schooling, reduced fertility rates, television viewing, and changing attitudes towards the family itself - is having a levelling effect on these particular villages, with the one that would traditionally have been lowest in status now showing many progressive features.||Paul Hockings

But only Korea achieved rapid industrial change by maintaining investment momentum. A bureaucratic approach to industrial governance and populist policies limited the development of the Brazilian and Indian state-owned steel industries. A comparative study of the these late industrialising countries tells us that both innovative behaviour and institutional capability are necessary to organise capitalist production.||Anthony P.

Congress has been a 'catchall' party and at the aggregate national level its support has cut across caste and class divides. But a study of election results from individual states shows that Congress support does vary with caste and class depending on its major rival. At one time the Congress had acquired and cultivated a diverse social profile through active political mobilisation. Today, it is reduced to picking up the leftover votes that other political parties have not mobilised.||Anthony Heath,Yogendra Yadav

It is discovered that there are well-defined relations between stock prices in the long run in each of these markets. Hence market segmentation is strongly ruled out. Second, the short-run behaviour of stock prices is such that no stock price can be considered to be independent of the others. Short-run price movements are mostly random or unstable, but the impulse response function analysis suggests that the instability does not persist for long. Finally, there seems to be a marked difference in the reaction in the two markets for the same stocks in terms of the responses to firm specific and market specific shocks. This may point to differences in the types of traders in these two exchanges.||Raghbendra Jha,Hari K. Nagarajan

But this is likely to increase substantially as a result of the implementation of the recommendations of the Pay Commission for central government employees. According to one estimate, if the salaries of the employees of state governments, state financial and aided educational institutions, local bodies and state-owned enterprises are revised to the level of central government employees, the revenue expenditure of the state governments will increase by Rs 20,000-30,000 crore a year.

In such a scenario, the task before the Congress leadership would be to disintegrate the mythical maratha vote and to seek to build new alliance of the poor maratha with other non-maratha castes including the dalits. This will virtually mean writing a fresh text in the politics of the state.||Suhas Palshikar

In case of the agrarian informal sector, pre-capitalist institutions of patronage perform this role of providing social security. In the case of the new industries, the process of flexibilisation has led to the generation of informal segments within the organised sector. Social security in this case is a complex issue since, firstly, it involves migration of labour from rural areas to what are termed as new townships; secondly, the labour in the new industries is recruited on contractual or casual basis; and thirdly, insecurity of employment prevents unionisation of labour. It is in this context that this paper attempts to define social security; conceptualise in what forms and through what institutions it finds an expression; and finally analyse what attributes enable access to these institutions.||G.

Through an analysis of the Indian nutritional supply and accessibility, this article focuses on the determining factors of production, distribution and consumption of lipids. It demonstrates that there is a much more severe deficiency of fats (and of calories) than that of carbohydrates and proteins, especially in rural India. This leads us to assess the role of food(-grain) policies following the green revolution.||Bruno Dorin

The present study attempts to open a solution channel by considering TFPG as a result of interaction between economies of scale and technical change. Thus, it seeks to lay emphasis on proper management of scale economies and technical change for producing a desired TFPG. For that purpose, estimation of TFPG is carried out with the help of translog cost function, which gives information on these two components simultaneously. The empirical findings of the exercise on data of aggregate manufacturing sector and eight selected industries of India indicate that both scale economies and technical change have registered a declining trend in recent years producing in the process a declining TFPG. There exists, therefore, a good case for prescribing policy measures that lead to better exploitation of economies of scale and technical change in India.||Gopinath Pradhan,Kaustuva Barik

Despite certain minor problems of definitions and measurements left unresolved by this exercise, the resulting integration helped us to detect the structural changes that have occurred in the real and financial sectors of the Indian economy over the entire sample period, in general, and between the pre- and post-liberalisation phases, in particular. In such a context, we have identified many important empirical patterns and regularities, notably the existence of business cycles, the counter-cyclical nature of inflation, the cyclical variations in income distribution, the twin deficits problem, the impact of absorption on reserves, the evolution of the debt-income ratio, the relationship between real interest rates and growth, the sustainability of the fiscal stance, amongst others, which could act as theoretical guideposts for the formulation of issues in the role and conduct of macro-economic stabilisation policy. In this first part, we use a consistency accounting matrix which specifies the linkages between sources and uses of funds as well as between institutional sector accounts. It is seen that the resulting framework ensures the numerical consistency of data drawn from different sources in such a way that both the sectoral budget constraints as well as the overall economywide budget constraints are simultaneously satisfied.||M.
