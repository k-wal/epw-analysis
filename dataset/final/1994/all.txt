The government's efforts to revitalise the movement gave birth to the concept of ujamaa villages which was rooted in an assumption of equal rights for all citizens, men and women. However, neither this nor the subsequent amendments to the co-operatives acts have been successful in empowering women. This article discusses the two types of co-operatives, the integrated models where both men and women are members and the women-only co-operatives, with a view to assessing their respective roles in empowering women and in changing their status.||Margareth R.

It is reflective, more generally, of a specific manifestation of a social process that has as its underlying basis deeply ingrained constructions of power and misogynous attitudes. This paper takes up a segment of the 'sati' debate and argues that much of the Sanskrit material that articulates traditional prescriptive codes of conduct for women has been misread and misinterpreted, skewing our understanding of many of the underlying social paradigms from which institutions such as sati have arisen and through which they have been preserved.||Sally J.

More critically, one needs to subvert the growing tendency among communalist forces to speak as non-'pseudo-secularists'. The most challenging of all tasks, however, would be to submit the dissensions among secularists to an inner critique not by assuming any consensus, but by opening up the differences through which new coalitions can be formed as part of a larger ongoing struggle to secularise society. It is now widely accepted that there can be no secularism without a process of secularisation, but the challenge of actualising it through concrete social, political, economic and educational measures is an enormous task. All we are capable of doing at present is to register our emergent resistance towards earlier certainties of secularism, dismantling, and in the process rebuilding, what has been received in the name of the secular.||Rustom Bharucha

The Muslim castes which have been particularly vulnerable to Hindu missionary efforts have been those which are only nominally Muslim and retain many Hindu customs and beliefs. Most of the mass conversions have occurred among Muslim Rajput groups. The Hindu missionaries, too, have shown an inordinate interest in converting the socially dominant and powerful Muslim Rajputs and not the 'lower' Muslim castes who form the majority of the Indian Muslim population. Finally, the mass conversions have mostly occurred in the backward regions of northern India where feudalism is still largely intact and where brahminism has not been challenged by assertive 'lower' castes.||Yoginder Sikand,Manjari Katju

In the context of environmentally sound technologies, the processing techniques for bagasse should become widely diffused in the industry to produce biomass fuel and other goods. If the existence of bagasse processing technologies is well documented, very few studies have been done on their economics. Referring mainly to the cases of Brazil and India, a look at the different costs (capital, operational, and final production cost) of technologies for drying, compacting, storing and transporting bagasse will partially explain their slow diffusion. A macroview at bagasse economics will show that the structure of the technology market is also one of the reasons for this lack of propagation. Moreover, in spite of an important potential demand, the lack of an existing market for bagasse-based products seems to be the key deterrent. The author also discusses a few conditions for the emergence of a bagasse market and the importance of pricing of bagasse.||Pierre Audinet

This paper critically examines this debate and concludes that the new series supports the Prebisch-Singer hypothesis. The terms of trade of primary products vis-a-vis manufactures have a statistically significant declining trend over the period 1900-86. The eruption of the debt crisis in the 1980s accentuated the situation. This is a deterministic trend, not simply the permanent effect of a temporary shock.||Prabirjit Sarkar

Inequality and poverty differences among SCs, STs and other households, rural-urban disparities and inter state variations in these respects are considered. The eastern region as a whole suffers from economic backwardness and large incidence of poverty and this is specially true for SCs and STs. Rural-urban disparities in consumption also exist with the urban sector better-off than the rural sector. Also, the SCs were found to be comparatively better-off than the STs. However, the generally held view that large inequalities exist among SCs and STs is ill-founded. State level comparison shows Assam to be performing better than the others, with lower poverty levels and more egalitarian distribution of consumption.||Mridul Saggar,Indranil Pan

31/12/1994- ||review of agriculture, december 1994||4402192||Indian Agriculture: Emerging Perspectives and Policy Issues||The process of economic reforms and the gradual opening up of Indian agriculture to world markets is likely to turn the terms of trade in favour of agriculture, creating a better incentive environment for agriculture than has been the case in the preceding decades. To fully exploit this opportunity, a major reform in supply-side factors is needed as well as a clean sweep to dismantle all export controls on agricultural commodities, including foodgrains. It is these supply-side factors - technology, fertilisers, irrigation, infrastructure and credit - that raise aggregate supply response and are the prime movers behind accelerated and sustainable growth of Indian agriculture. With the broad policy changes in supply-side factors discussed in this paper, India can feasibly benefit from the changing economic scene in the country and abroad by accelerating the growth of its agricultural sector, providing momentum to the overall growth of the economy and leading to greater employment, regional and sectoral equity, faster poverty reduction, more efficient resource use and better protection of the environment than before.||C.

Two years in China, three semesters teaching in an American maximum security prison, and membership of an 'anti-war' mission to Cambodia at the time of the Tet offensive have influenced the author's perspective on Tiananmen, torture and Pol Pot. Without seeking to forget these by 'looking the other way', the author believes that an attempt to see ourselves as others see us, by 'looking the other way' from East to West, may also have its value. The point is not that our memories are too extensive, but that, on the contrary, they are too limited.||Philippa Tristram

Indeed, Hitler had already found how to cure unemployment before Keynes had finished explaining why it occurred. It was a joke in Germany that Hitler was planning to give employment in straightening the Crooked Lake, painting the Black Forest white and putting down linoleum in the Polish Corridor. With the passage of time, the economic, political and cultural fallout of the Keynes-Hitler sodality has tended only to become more sinister, not less.||Narindar Singh

Quite in line with this, the introduction of joint forest management systems (JFMS) in 11 states of India is easily promoted and readily interpreted as a major shift from state regulation towards people's participation in forest management. It is important, however, to not only examine this issue in terms of its claims but also carefully perceive and interpret these claims as well as their underlying limitations. There is a need to relate the discussions on JFMS and people's participation to wider theoretical questions about the very essence of people's participation.||Dolly Arora

It is found to be a significant source of manufacturing employment. Particularly, during the period 1981 to 1991, most of the addition to the manufacturing employment has come from non-household non-factory segment. Registered small-scale (SIDO) units are found to be a small but growing segment of manufacturing. It is observed that wages in small-scale units are lower relative to the large-scale sector but labour productivity is not proportionately lower in 1987-88. This suggests that the shift to non-factory employment may be due to labour cost advantages of small-scale production. The production of reserved items is not found to be a dominant activity of SSI units. The estimated output share of reserved items in industries with larger share of the number of reserved items is not found to have increased. This questions the policy of product reservation for the small-scale sector.||K. V. Ramaswamy

The dictates of globalisation have required lowering of customs duties and reduced public investments. Both of these have meant a narrowing of the home market and dependence on the private sector to promote growth. This has required incentives to capital through tax cuts which have led to larger budgetary deficits and lower public investments. These and other policies have shifted the distribution of national income in favour of the propertied and further narrowed the home market and reduced the prospects for growth. The new economic policies have not induced the expected supply side responses due to lack of demand in spite of the rise in budgetary deficits but have resulted in cost-push inflation. This has simultaneously caused the fiscal crisis and slowed down growth. With one-time adjustments mostly exhausted and elections round the corner, the fiscal situation can only worsen and the manner in which this will happen will prevent growth from reviving. The resort to fudges to dress up the new economic policies is proving a one-way street to fiscal and economic crisis.||Arun Kumar

But in its principal aspect it has functioned less as a means of ascertaining and enthroning the will of the majority than as a means of sharing out patronage, power and property among the rich and the powerful. From the village sarpanch to the MLA, most of the elected representatives today are leaders of gangs armed to the teeth, and the consequent terror is a decisive factor in deciding elections.||K.

However, the task of stabilisation has been far from successful. Even without implementing the really painful prescriptions, demand and business expectations have posed problems. Uncertainties and shrinking employment opportunities have compounded the difficulties. Structural adjustments, in terms of institution building, organisational changes and redefining the role of government, particularly in actively easing infrastructural bottlenecks and creating basic capabilities for the large number of the underprivileged (in whose name all the reforms are being undertaken) have been patchy and hesitant. A quick and substantial integration with the world economy has, however, been attempted and is bound to have transitional costs in agriculture and the capital goods sector.||Anup Sinha

The budget reflects the government's concern for reviving this segment of the economy. However, the efficacy of the instruments chosen is not assured. The slow growth of capital goods production suggests that this is very likely due to slack investment outlay. The private sector appears to be waiting for recovery. In the absence of a strategy to precipitate private activity the government is going to be left waiting for private investment. A simple measure that might have helped a little is recommended in this essay. But even this can only be a palliative. The most elementary analysis of events in the past three years points to the reason for the slow growth of industrial activity. This is the slow growth of capital spending by government.||Pulapre Balakrishnan

Land redistribution is a prerequisite for the expansion of the domestic market for labour-intensive non-farm goods and hence for the development of this sector.||Sunil Ray

This is an important theoretical issue suggested not only by the current Indian context but also other historical contexts, e g, Thatcherite Britain. This paper is addressed to this issue. The author's basic argument is that this represents another facet of 'globalisation'. In an economy which has no control over capital flows and where the policy regime favours a retreat of the state from the arena of production, such a combination of stagnation, reserve accumulation and government impotence can easily arise. Critics of 'market-friendly' regimes in the context of third world economies have typically emphasised the possibility of capital outflows and dwindling reserves as constituting, almost exclusively, the inherent danger of such regimes. But this is a partial view. Such an economy is threatened as much by accumulating reserves as by dwindling reserves. If the adverse consequences of the latter are more dramatic, those of the former are by no means less significant.||Prabhat Patnaik

The situation changed distinctly in the 1980s.

Such a strategy can promote broad-based agricultural growth which would not only increase the growth rate of the economy but, more important, enable the backward areas and the poor to participate in growth and share in its benefits. Without such a long-term perspective, liberalisation, instead of promoting growth would only intensify the gathering crisis in the economy.||V. M. Rao

First, the author describes an empirical approach to the assessment of intra-firm capabilities. Firms can acquire and configure resources. These are key building-blocks of firms' strategy as assumed in the emerging resource or capability-based view of strategic behaviour and performance analysis. However, the way resources are utilised are the principal causes of firms' success in attaining economic outcomes. While the process of resource utilisation is invisible, the use of data envelopment analysis (DEA) highlights firms' 'revealed' success in resource utilisation and co-ordination of activities, and DEA is described in detail. Second, empirical analyses of the capabilities and performance patterns of a group of firms in the Indian pharmaceutical industry are carried out.||Sumit K. Majumdar

The discussion here is at a level removed from the everyday practices of production and consumption and from much of what is called 'market economy'. It focuses on the view from the successive cores of the capitalist world-economy such as Amsterdam in the 17th century, Great Britain in the 19th century and the United States in the 20th century. It gives attention to those events and processes that had systemic ramifications, largely ignoring those of regional or local significance. The attempt here is to describe the transitions at the apex of a world-economy consisting of several different regional hierarchies of finance both public and private, from Amsterdam to London, then, from London to a more global system led by New York, and finally to a tripolar world led by Tokyo.||Krishnendu Ray

How valid is this proposition?

Even aggregative analysis, taking demand and supply factors along with monetary variables, has been found to be empirically unsatisfactory as quantifying the impact of any one variable on sectoral prices is not easy. This study attempts a disaggregative analysis by considering the structural variables first and then analysing the influence of monetary aggregates on sectoral prices taking into account the time series properties of price indices and specifying the sectoral price equations.||A.

While the National Telecom Policy (NTP) is undoubtedly a bold step, it does not go far enough. In particular, the NTP continues to propagate a centralised decision-making approach, at variance with the emerging needs. The exclusion of the states in any sphere of decision-making is a serious lacuna. Another particularly significant omission in the NTP is the lack of any reference to an independent regulatory authority for the telecom sector. And, to make matters worse, whatever the drawbacks of the NTP, the evidence suggests that the operational guidelines may have even more deleterious effects.||Pronab Sen

However, a question remains. Would external capital flows into the Asia-Pacific region remain largely confined to a small number of high-growth east and south-east Asian economies or would it spread to other countries of the region, especially in south Asia, which encompasses some of the most populous countries of the world? A related question is: what needs to be done for realising a new Asian division of labour which would bring out the full potential of these different economies in a mutually beneficial manner. This has become all the more urgent in the face of the emerging regional trading blocs in North America and Europe. This paper (a) analyses the recent trends, patterns and prospects of foreign resource flows in various forms (e g, official development finance, commercial bank lending and foreign direct investment) into the countries of the Asia-Pacific region in the context of the questions raised above and (b) suggests some areas of action which are of particular relevance for international bankers, investors and government policy-makers. In particular, it focuses on the crucial role of intra-regional resource flows (especially from Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore) in providing investible funds, technology, managerial skills and markets for the other countries of the region.||Alok Ray

31/12/1994- ||review of agriculture, december 1994||4402194||Farm Size, Factor Productivity and Returns to Scale under Different Types of Water Management||It used to be claimed, notably in Indian subcontinent that there is either a positive or negative significant relationship between land productivity and farm size. Attempts were made to explain the relationship using two important factors, viz, disguise unemployment and imperfection of factor markets. Solutions such as supply of inputs, land reform, etc, were suggested. Yet in poorer countries the odds are that even within a village and during any peak farm operation the question of disguise unemployment is liable to be troublesome in rice economies as these are time-specific and water management-specific. What is thus interesting and seems to have been missed out by the existing literature is that several of the factors can be exacerbated or minimised depending on the management of water in question. This article re-explores the problem on the basis of field studies in Bangladesh. The study is unable to trace any kind of significant relationship between the farm size and land productivity in both monsoon and rabi season. Instead, it appears that water management in a specific land elevation is most relevant in a village in explaining land productivity differentials.||Arindam Banik

First, it seems imperative that scholarship on riots incorporates both the view from above and the view from below, for each perspective illuminates only part of the story. Without this sense of historical evolution it would be difficult to explain why Bijnor experienced riots in 1990 rather than 30 or 40 years earlier. Second, only a close examination of conflicts at the local level reveals the interweaving of economic, political and social strands that are more difficult to disentangle at the national level. Third, the concept of agency needs to be informed by an understanding of the ways in which it is often inextricably linked to victimisation. Fourth, the importance of depicting the state in the plural rather than the singular, and in particular of exploring its role at the local level, needs to be emphasised.||Amrita Basu

14/5/1994- ||special articles||4401202||International Trade and the Agricultural Sector in India||This paper analyses the impact on Indian agriculture of trade policy reform in India and multilateral trade liberalisation internationally. The rationale and structure of India's trade policy regime for agriculture over the last three decades are outlined to highlight the fundamental departures implicit in the recent trade policy reform. This is followed by discussion of the significance of the agricultural sector in India's economy and foreign trade on the one hand and the importance of Indian agriculture in world output and trade on the other and comparison of domestic and world prices for selected agricultural products. The analysis is developed further to cover the implications and consequences of trade policy reform in India for the agricultural sector in particular and the economy in general. Shifting attention to the international context, the status of trade in agriculture in the multilateral trading system so far is outlined to bring out the fundamental departures contemplated in the Uruguay Round and their possible implications for the agricultural sector and the economy in India are examined. Some conclusions that emerge from the analysis are drawn together in the final section of the paper.||Deepak Nayyar,Abhijit Sen

18/6/1994- ||special articles||4401365||Poverty and Income Distribution in India||Against the background of global poverty and income distribution pattern, this paper analyses the trends and causal factors behind rural poverty in India both at the national and state levels during 1957-58 to 1986-87. Adopting an alternate model and categorisation of the time period of analysis into two phases which is empirically and theoretically justified the paper observes that contrary to the findings of other researchers, not only are there distinct time trends in the incidence of rural poverty in India, but also while these trends were positive and significant in Period I (1957-58 to 1968-69), they were negative and significant in Period II (1969-70 to 1986-87). Also, the rate of decline in the incidence of rural poverty in the latter period was much higher than the rate of increase in rural poverty in the preceding period. These observations are valid for both all-India and across states, using alternate measures of poverty, i e, the head count ratio and Sen's poverty index. The paper then attempts both a time series and cross-section analysis of the causal factors behind rural poverty in India, especially probing into the role of agricultural growth, inflation, access to subsidised food through the public distribution system, population pressure on environmental resources, rural consumption levels and inequality, and infrastructure development on the incidence of rural poverty for all-India and across states. The paper suggests that policies to accelerate agricultural growth, infrastructure development and provide better access to subsidised food, along with measures to control inflation promise to be most effective in reducing the incidence of rural poverty in India. Measures to control population growth and promote environmental conservation too ought to be incorporated into anti-poverty alleviation strategies in India. The paper cautions against the implications of recent policy changes in India, viz, structural adjustments, resulting in low priority to agriculture as against industry, slashing of public expenditures on social sectors including subsidised food, etc, which are detrimental to the poor and could reverse the negative trends in rural poverty visible after 1969-70.||K.

The measured P/E ratio may be high because of abnormally low earnings during 1991-92 and the high P/E ratios of foreign controlled enterprises. Even after adjusting for these two factors the P/E ratios is likely to be high relative to historical levels and relative to P/E ratios of other emerging markets. However, given its excellent diversification potential the Indian stock market may be attractive to foreign investors in spite of its high P/E ratio.||Sidharth Sinha

The present crisis would appear to be the outcome of the cumulative impact of a gamut of structural maladies the economy has inherited on account of the particular development strategy it followed. A vicious circle of dependence has developed overtime which seems to be gathering pace among trade and investment dependence, the weak balance of payments, slow growth rate and declining manufacturing productivity in the Canadian economy. This paper is an attempt to understand the nature and significance of the structural features and factors that have contributed to the ongoing crisis in Canada.||P. Mohanan Pillai

The dependent variabe of the model is industry-wise mandays lost per employee from disputes and independent variables are the degree of trade unionisation, average factory size and average monthly earnings of an employee. It is found that in more unionised industries, mandays lost from disputes are likely to be less compared to less unionised industries. In contrast, industries with larger average factory size will have greater mandays lost. Employees' monthly earnings seem to be a weak variable having ambiguous and almost insignificant effects on mandays lost.||Bibhas Saha,Indranil Pan

Irrigation uncertainty leads to a lower incidence of tenancy and the form itself changes in the direction of sharecropping. In understanding the terms of contract in the land market, a unified treatment of the land and labour markets is helpful. But its application is limited to the case when the crop cultivated is a subsistence crop.

It is the matrilateral kin who to a large degree guaranteed a woman's security and welfare and that their marginalisation is a major reason why women in upwardly mobile groups are increasingly at risk.||Karin Kapadia

Consequently, an essential power the states must endow the panchayats with is that to recruit and control their own staff. At the same time, unless traditional notions like permanent employment, security, service cadres and reserved posts are reconsidered, panchayats will be unable to innovate instrumentalities suited to their purpose.||Nirmal Mukarji

Today something quite different is happening: the very sufferers from the system (including the caste system) are invoking caste identity and claims. Of course, as there is no clear and well-thought-out ideological framework that is relevant to undertaking these new struggles, co-operation and buying up, divide and rule by the dominant class or party continues. But it appears from a variety of indications that the process has started and there is need to provide fresh impetus and intellectual understanding backed by political action based on new models of coalition-making that cut across the wide array of deprived and oppressed social strata.||Rajni Kothari

The inhabitants of the Lakshadweep group of coral islands present a fascinating instance of this kind. The people of Lakshadweep have followed matriliny under the rubric of Islam. As a consequence their conceptions of rights relating to property and its actual distribution have been governed by customary law upholding matrilineal principles along with an application of rules deriving their sanction from Quranic injunctions and the sharia. Focusing on the process of devolution and disposal of property in Kalpeni, one of the 10 inhabited islands of the Lakshadweep group, this study presents situations in which parts of two legal systems were used at different points in the same disputes or in which there was simultaneous use of elements of both systems.||Leela Dube

The denial of schooling in the mother tongue to children of tribal communities assumes significance in the context of their poor response to formal education and high attrition rates. A growing body of research on language and education of ethnic minorities in western societies highlights the crucial role played by home languages in early learning. This paper discusses some critical issues pertaining to the medium of instruction at the primary stage and reviews policy and practice relating to mother tongue education for tribal children in India.||Geetha B.

Should structural reforms be pursued without first stabilising the economy? The finance minister intends to revive the capital goods sector through a Keynesian deficit-induced multiplier-accelerator mechanism. But if the historical linkage between capital goods industries and the government's own expenditure on capital formation is any guide, then the drastic budget cut on the latter's account would frustrate his objectives. Here we shall describe a new type of inflation, unheard of by the monetarists and the structuralists alike. This inflation springs from the wealth effect that emanates, unlike its Pigouvian cousin, from the stock market. The budget will dig this channel of inflation deeper. There is a widespread misconception about subsidy and its magnitude. The well publicised estimate that puts total subsidies at 15 per cent of GDP relies on a wrong formula and a false notion. The professed 'middle path' has degenerated in reality into a 'middle-class path' with an inclination towards the top-rich.||Ranjit Sau

18/6/1994- ||special articles||4401363||Modes of History Writing: New Hindu History of Ayodhya||The right-wing Hindu movement of the last decade or so has done all it can to promote an alternative account of the history of Ayodhya and its association with Ram. While this new account is in line with much of the modern Indian effort since the 19th century to establish the historicity, rationality, masculinity-in a word, 'adulthood' in western terms-of India and its religion(s), it carries very much further the positivism and literalism inherent in the understanding of modernity that has informed that tendency. From the standpoint of modes of history writing, there are two points of special interest in the new version of the story of Ayodhya. The first is that it claims to be history-in a way that popular Hindu tradition (and Gandhi) would never have bothered to do. The second is that this history is fundamentally ahistorical-in that it allows for no change or development in the character, position, interests, behaviour (shall we say, the history?) of its several protagonists.||Gyanendra Pandey

(b) Granting patent rights for a significant period can eliminate consumers in poorer nations. The argument that rising prices are going to affect 'the poor' severely in a developing country is hard to sustain simply because of tremendous disparity in the initial income distribution. (c) Local R and D development should be positively related to the protection of property rights. Global R and D investments may disperse towards developing countries given a stronger patent law. However, prices of pharmaceuticals may not have anything to do with the sunk cost of R and D.||Sugata Marjit

However, there could arise the need to supplement the funds of the state governments in order to make it possible for them to make adequate devolution to their local bodies.

Characterisations of attached labour varies from 'unfree slaves' to a 'privileged class'. Based on an intensive field study of three villages of a green revolution district of Haryana, this paper argues that far from being a privileged class, attached labourers are the most deprived category in the agrarian society of Haryana. Attached labour functioned more as a labour mortage system for interest free credit rather than a subsistence guarantee arrangement. However, though attached labour is still perpetuated through prolonged indebtedness and obviously has elements of unfreedom, counter-tendencies are also significant. Along with other factors, weakening of the ideology of patronage and loyalty, availability of employment outside agriculture and, most importantly, growing dislike of the relationship among labourers has given rise to tensions and conflicts leading to a gradual decline of the system.||Surinder S.

The main strategy pursued by the women's movement has involved lobbying the legislature for legal reform and raising questions on constitutional provisions by using the discourse of rights in the courts, and is informed by a liberal understanding of law which focuses on the need to protect individual rights from being encroached upon by the state. While this approach has secured some personal rights for women, it precludes an understanding and inquiry into the deeper relationship between social and economic oppression and law.||Fatema Rashid Hasan

The contemporary world displays two contradictory signs in three spheres-economic, political, and religious. Forces of liberalism and those of ultra-conservatism seem to be at work at the same time. With elements from the contributions of Kosambi, Mahalanobis, and Myrdal on India, the author constructs a theory, and projects it on the global scene to illuminate the present complex reality. With the third industrial revolution beginning in the aftermath of the second world war, the international economic order has entered a new stage. The dynamics of this New Imperialism is captured here with 'the new growth theory' formulated in the 1980s. Where did the 'dependency theory' go wrong? Is the theory of 'unequal exchange' false? What is driving India towards globalisation? These are some of the questions that are addressed.||Ranjit Sau

While there has probably been considerable fertility and mortality decline in India during the 1980s, it is much less certain that the last decade has witnessed any reduction in the rate of population growth. A picture of constant rate of population growth between 1971-81 and 1981-91 is far more convincing - coupled with a higher rate of all-India growth during the 1961-71 decade.||Tim Dyson

The regulations apply to investment or merchant banking services required for corporate issues of long-term securities in India. The authors find that some implications of the guidelines may be in conflict with the professed objective of the current economic policy to induce the corporate sector to raise external funds from private investors. Further, the guidelines may be self-defeating in that they may result in less, rather than more, information for the investing public about the typically unobservable quality of a new issue.||Sankar De,Sushil Khanna

However, in large princely states such as Mysore forms of state legality remained independent of this particular dynamic. The process of modernisation was initiated by the bureaucracy itself. This article delineates one aspect of this modernising process that signalled shifts in the definition of domestic and non-domestic sexuality, giving specific attention to the legal-administrative measures surrounding the gradual disempowerment of devadasis attached to muzrai temples.||Janaki Nair

Over the last three decades, Singapore has been able to combine good macro-economic performance and good social and demographic indicators with authoritarian policy and corporatist management. Singapore has used market as an instrument rather than as a mechanism. The paper discusses the issue of economic boundaries of the state in Section II; budgetary policy in Section III; role of public enterprises which has been extensive in Singapore in Section IV; and the Central Provident Fund (CPF), which has become an important socio-economic institution, in Section V. The paper cautions that unless certain pre-conditions are met, pursual of policies and style of management similar to that of Singapore by others could lead to very different results. Therefore, great care must be taken in drawing lessons concerning the role of the state from Singapore's experience. The paper suggests that rapid aging of the population combined with affluence would pose a formidable challenge to the policy-makers, and meeting it may require significant modifications to the present role of the state in Singapore.||Mukul G.

It is argued that while the FDI inflow into India is likely to increase, it would never be anywhere near the $ 4 billion or so per year that is anticipated by the government and hoped for by business. By contrast, international subcontracting by foreign firms could play a major role in manufactured export growth. This is an aspect which, while vitally important for Indian manufacturing, has attracted little attention in terms of policy.||Sebastian Morris

Twelve years later, Samuelson lifted this duality out of the realm of the Nazi metaphysic and inducted it into the realm of the liberal metaphysic. That he could do it so easily and without any fear of the transplant being in any way 'rejected' by the recipient clearly shows that the two sets of illusions, each equating guns with national strength and security, were not mutually incompatible. Samuelson has continued ever since to use this duality to sell the fiction of an undifferentiated and homogeneous mass of people embodied in his 'we' and in Goering's 'us', concealing the truth that it is the ruling minorities which manage to corner both the guns and the butter with the result that for the rest the choice, if any, would mean not a thing.||Narindar Singh

For their efficient and equitable performance it is imperative that their beneficiary farmers be accorded well defined and legally enforceable water rights. Conferments of such water rights by the state in the past, at the time of revenue settlements, has encouraged the formation of water users associations which help in conflict resolution among beneficiaries as also in effective maintenance of kuhls. While government support for major repairs and channel modernisation is welcome, the state needs to do much more than simply offering financial assistance for kuhl development. It should take the initiative to confer water rights also.||Ramesh Chand

29/1/1994- ||review of political economy, january 1994||4400722||Marxian Political Economy as Method: How Political Is Political Economy?||There is no single unequivocal meaning that can be assigned to political economy. Whereas the concept of political economy presumes a symbiotic relationship between politics and economics, the positing of the relationship only creates a theoretical space where it can be spelt out. Consequently, a theoretical requirement of the use of political economy as method is the mapping out of the relationship. In the absence of such mapping, political economy tends to be buffeted between 'economism' and 'politicism' and seen as merely a perspective. But political economy is not merely a perspective, it is much more: it is a concept and a method as well. It is the combination of these three aspects which gives political economy its particular relevance as a mode of enquiry into social phenomena.||Neera Chandhoke

By questioning the propositions of a much talked about perfect competition and by suggesting that institutions do matter, it presents a framework for a new theory on the functions of capital markets in the developed world.

The two set up an internal dialogue and self-interrogation that moved across his earlier, relatively open-ended and often radical phase and later more dogmatic and recognisably revivalist work. The paper is centrally concerned with the profound breaks in thinking and expression as well as with the fundamental continuities that were preserved through certain narrative tropes and devices by which Bankim continued to destabilise his seemingly unambiguous agenda of a triumphalist Hindu people. The focus is on Bankim's last five years when he composed three historical novels on Hindu-Muslim antagonism and two polemical essays on an authentic and reinvigorated Hinduism to be attained through a disciplinary regime that Bankim spelt out in some detail.||Tanika Sarkar

Apart from the niggardly increases in wage rates and the continued denial of variable dearness allowance, the employers have gained (and the workers have been made to lose) Rs 11 crore just by the delay in arriving at the agreement. No wonder, the level of living of this section of isolated, predominantly tribal, workers has shown no improvement, though the viability of the tea industry and the profits of the employers have improved significantly over the last decade and more.||Sharit K.

26/11/1994- ||special articles||4402070||Developing Economy Macroeconomics: Fresh Perspectives||Aspects of New Keynesian Economic, Rational Expectations and General Equilibrium Macroeconomic theories, issues of dynamics and stability are selectively surveyed in this paper. Insights are extracted from these for analysing special features of a typical developing economy. Building on these, an analytical frame is presented in which the role of demand and supply factors in India's medium-run macroeconomic performance can be consistently examined. Using this, it is shown that (i) multiple equilibria with excess capacity and positive mark-ups are consistent with profit maximisation by firms; (ii) growth cycles (or switches between equilibria) can occur as a result of endogenous amplification of demand and supply shocks. The mark-up is shown to be relatively rigid and counter-cyclical; (iii) the behaviour of major macro time series of the Indian economy are explained and reproduced in terms of such growth cycles; and (iv) systemic interactions of increasing levels of complexity are examined. One unambiguous policy implication that comes out of the different exercises is the importance of maintaining high public sector investment.||Ashima Goyal

Though the ideal of democracy is proclaimed by everyone on the political stage, not only is their understanding of what they mean by democracy confused and primitive, they invariably view their opponents as no less than enemies. The roots of the tragic events of October 1993 were precisely in the approach that an opponent is not only an opponent but a mortal enemy. Two consequences unavoidably follow from this state of affairs combined with president Yeltsin's penchant for doing everything with his personal imprint. First, the institutions being set up now have no lasting character and are being constantly tinkered with, above all by the president himself. Second, the enormous powers now being concentrated in the institution of the presidency might be easily and massively abused. Such an eventuality cannot be ruled out, the more so because it is becoming clear that unless there is a miracle in the economic sphere within a year or so and if elections are held - this is becoming a bigger 'if' all the time - Yeltsin will not be the next president. A silent vote of no confidence in him is steadily building up.||Dev Murarka

The housing market, too, has tended to be dominated by people who are speculators rather than genuine purchasers of long-term housing services. But rather than attempting to reintroduce controls, for example on international capital flows, which both the ideological climate and recent technological advances make unrealistic, there is a lot to be said for getting agreements on some 'Pigovian' carrot and stick measures: that is to say, while not directly stopping anyone from doing anything, yet indirectly giving them incentives radically to change their behaviour.||G.

In order to identify the economic forces behind the emerging scenario this paper takes the developments in the financial sector as its point of departure, mainly because the primary concern of the government remains reduction of the fiscal and monetised deficits. Section II of the paper summarises the behaviour of money and credit during 1993-94 and draws attention to some serious limitations of the official explanations of some financial developments. Section III attempts a resolution of the paradoxes taking into account the interaction between the financial and the real sectors. In terms of the analytical framework used in this context, Section IV provides a critique of the budgetary proposals for 1994-95 and suggests some policy alternatives. The final section summarises the main results.||Mihir Rakshit

This was a case about the government's package solution on Ayodhya which the minority found invidious and the majority had to virtually rewrite and re-package. But when all is said and done, the majority judgment is not a juristic victory for secularism and may trouble the secular cause for many years to come.||Rajeev Dhavan

Social progress is achieved by the constant revolutionising of the technical forces of production, by new discoveries of processes and products. It is inevitable that outdated technologies and products which no longer have a market must perish. However, at the micro level, at the level of individual industrial units, it is essential that every attempt should be made to revive a sick unit when it is possible to do so and liquidation should be resorted to only when it is wholly unviable. The Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) was set up for the timely detection of industrial sickness and speedy determination of preventive and remedial measures. This paper attempts to critically review the performance of the BIFR in this regard.||M. S. Narayanan

The plan targets have been prescriptive for the public sector, the Planning Commission acting as a clearing house for many crucial economic decisions taken at different institutional and regional levels, for ensuring inter-sectoral and inter-temporal consistencies by the use of a formal 'economic model'. For the private sector, the plan targets have been only indicative. The difference now is that whereas earlier, to enforce indicative targets in the private sector, instruments such as 'taxes and subsidies' and 'prices, licensing and quantitative controls' were deliberately used, beginning with the Eighth Plan, planning will have to operate in a more deregulated environment as far as the private sector is concerned. The important question is how indicative planning for the private sector in a more deregulated environment, with hardly any instruments to enforce the indicated targets, will fit into overall economic planning.||V.

Can the violence be attributed to economic interests posing as religious ones? Different aspects of these arguments are examined and found wanting. The longer-term consequences of the violence for the future of communal relations in Bijnor are not hopeful, as Bijnor experiences a 'criminalisation of politics' with its ethnic competition and collective violence as an integral component. Despite the fact of close interrelationships on a daily basis, people are increasingly seeing themselves and others in 'communal' terms. Muslims will continue to suffer most from this 'crisis of government'-from those entrusted with the governing as well as from those who benefit most from the status quo.||Roger Jeffery,Patricia M.

Other errors that are generated during census data collection are, however, not evaluated. As the census figures are often used without critically examining the data, an analysis of the process by which data are obtained can identify the errors generated. In this paper a framework for analysing measurement error is presented. Based on the framework, the results of a survey of 1981 Census enumerators are discussed. This exploratory survey is focused on the primary demographic data collected in the census using two individual (universal and sample) forms. While some errors are committed by enumerators, other errors occur independent of enumerator characteristics.||Murali Dhar Vemuri

Such competitiveness has, however, to be obtained in the society and at the workplace where the productive energy of the people has to be released for greater innovativeness and creativity. With the growing unemployment in the country and the threatened 'exit' and 'downsizing' which is likely to result under privatisation, the society, as a whole, and the workplace, in particular, may have to suffer moral and mental health problems.

Central to their success are three important features of their design which enable the interests of thousands of cane growers to coalesce into a powerful member organisation, which operates as an engine of wealth generation for its members and remains member-oriented through a patronage cohesive governance structure. A major institution that supports patronage cohesive governance is the informal and yet dynamic market in the shares of these co-operatives in south Gujarat. The prices these shares command are important to their owners as: (a) a form of wealth, (b) a performance index, and (c) an instrument of member control. As a robust if imperfect summary index of management performance on which information is available widely and openly, this market price of the co-operative's share encourages the board and management to continually search for and adopt member-oriented policies.||R.

The new vision implies a radical disjunction. Not only are the rules of the game being altered but new national priorities are being fixed, and a whole set of policy instruments is being dismantled. This article examines the changing role of the market as an instrument as a basis for evaluating the implications of the market for efficiency and equity. In the process the market as an instrument is contrasted with democracy as a value. Against this background the validity of a uniform policy for all developing countries seeking social transformation regardless of their socio-historical specificities and their economic and political structure is questioned.||Kanta Ranadive

The study also finds that most of the states experiencing growth acceleration are relatively less well off. There are marked tendencies for convergence of long-term economic growth rate among Indian states. The growth experience and development strategies differ significantly among states. The leading states also show different patterns of growth. In the Indian industrial sector, the existence of a sharp north-south divide is further corroborated.||Ravindra H. Dholakia

Its population has increased three-fold in the last two decades. The mushrooming of mainly fake small-scale industries has contributed to the unplanned growth of the city. Nouveau riche entrepreneurs, bootleggers, power brokers and other lumpens dominate the society and the administration. Water, health and sanitation, traffic and police systems are grossly inadequate and inefficient, and have failed to meet the changing needs of the city population. Absence of the state was conspicuous in the initial stages of the communal riots of 1992-93 and the current plague epidemic. Persistent anxiety, apprehension and fear haunt the common citizens, and distrust of the state looms large in their mind.||Ghanshyam Shah

But since the revised GATT needs to be ratified by all countries, the remedy now lies with parliament.

Some of the reforms have been pushed through, but one of the major reasons for the economic situation reaching a crisis point in 1991-the unsustainable fiscal imbalance-continues to hover menacingly over the economy despite being within the immediate control of the government. The unwillingness and/or inability of the government to control its own expenditure in areas where they need to be cut has resulted in strategies to reduce the fiscal deficit (like cutting capital expenditure and passing on the adjustment burden to the states) which are questionable and counterproductive. While these strategies continue to hold sway, the measures to promote investment contained in the latest budget are almost entirely confined to the supply side, although available evidence suggests that the problem lies on the demand side. The strategy of sacrificing fiscal prudence (and possibly stability of the economy) in the interest of growth that has been advanced to defend the rising deficits is unconvincing; it will lead to neither growth nor stability.||Tapas K.

Having worked out such a 'fascist minimum', the author argues that the social, economic and political evolution of late capitalism in the second half of the 20th century has made problematic the usefulness of the fascist paradigm. He views the political vehicles of religious fundamentalism or religion-based nationalism not so much as fascist formations as, at most, potentially so where that potential may or may not be realised. Following from this, Hindu nationalism is seen as a specific Indian manifestation of a generic phenomenon but not one that belongs to the genus of fascism.||Achin Vanaik

The cost-benefit calculation of academic degree above the basic degree in engineering shows that the cost for the degree is more than twice the benefit.

Complicating the issue further is the fact that the bulk of the expenditure on social sectors is incurred by the state governments which have pursued human development strategies with varying degrees of intensity.

While only he had to grapple with his predicament, his dilemmas were not of his own making. They were typical products of the hegemonic Bolshevik universe, particularly its organisational ethos. While he was a partially emancipated member of this universe, his politics was rooted in the peculiar condition in which the hegemony of Bolshevism had survived in the Soviet system. What proved to be his undoing was the manner in which he related to the Soviet reality: He did not understand that he was making ideological appeals to a society that had been, in essence, completely de-ideologised over the decades.||Bhupinder Brar

17/9/1994- ||special articles||4401788||Fate of the Forest: Conservation and Tribal Rights||The recent circulation of a draft Forest Act has once again brought into question the future of India's forests. The draft Act proposes to take a strongly conservationist stand against environmental degradation by severely restricting people's rights to the forest. How environmentally successful and socially just will such a policy be? This essay examines the experience of adivasis in Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, whose livelihood derives from their use of the forest, and who are held responsible by the state for destroying the forest. The state's persistent efforts to deny adivasi rights to the forest has resulted in an ongoing conflict that today constitutes the biggest obstacle to forest conservation. The author analyses the relationships between adivasis, the state and the forest to argue that the future of India's forests is inseparable from the future of India's adivasis. Forest conservation is possible only if people's rights are recognised and established within a larger programme of tribal development.||Amita Baviskar

It was the culmination of a struggle which the oppressed majority had waged in order to win acceptance of their claim to be recognised as human beings, of equal value to and with the same rights as their oppressors. What made this miracle possible? More specifically, what caused the head of the apartheid regime, F W de Klerk, to make the momentous decision in February 1990 to unban the ANC and free Nelson Mandela? How had the tortuous negotiations which ensued between the government and the ANC succeeded in achieving the constitutional settlement under which the elections were held?

The data show significant variations across taluks in terms of literacy achievements during the period between 1971 and 1991. To take the analysis one step further, this paper presents, albeit in a limited manner, some facts on educational facilities and literacy status in the villages of two Tamil Nadu districts. The underlying motivation of such disaggregated study is to develop useful typologies of taluks/villages which may, in turn, constitute the basis for both designing micro studies as well as discerning macro trends.||A.

These countries are proceeding with reforms at a breakneck speed to make up for the 'precious time lost'. The reforms which South Korea and Taiwan implemented during the course of two decades are being carried out overnight. This paper while highlighting the main elements of evolution of external sector reforms in the Asian region during the past three decades throws light on the gray prospects of Asian exports in the context of ongoing global recession, protectionist tendencies of developed countries and shrinking global savings and liquidity.||Srinivasa Madhur

It is now time to seek more durable, though politically harder and technically challenging, options like the institution of a water rights system. What is the status of the issue of water rights in current policy? What are the legal, economic, and physical characters and requirements that a water rights structure should satisfy? Do we have enough institutional and technical potential for instituting a water rights system capable of tackling the critical issue of water distribution between uses and users that too both across time and space?||R.

As against the National Health Policy guidelines the regional disparities in health service service utilisation among different expenditure groups of states as well as rural-urban disparities tend to continue. Further, in spite of inadequacy of health services and prevalence of inequality in utilisation, there has been no serious governmental initiative to encourage appropriate utilisation by means of devising health insurance and other cost recovery mechanisms.||Brijesh C.

15/1/1994- ||special articles||4400664||Assets and Liabilities of Government of India||Since 1982-83, the liabilities of the Central Government have shown an excess over its assets and the excess has been steadily increasing. In 1993-94 almost 40 per cent of the Government's liabilities are not matched by any assets. This is a matter of serious concern. Further, receipts of interest on loans and advances and dividends and profits on investment taken together have almost never exceeded 70 per cent of the Government's interest payments and since 1985-86 they have been less than 50 per cent. While some public investment is necessary to provide public services, at least since 1980-81 the receipts from these services have covered less than 30 per cent of the revenue expenditure on the provision of these services. These are statistical inferences based on the factual experience of the last three decades and one need not surrender one's policy judgment to statistical regressions. Nevertheless, whatever the purpose of a large and dominating public sector, it must ultimately show in its performance.||V. M. Dandekar

It is no accident that the only success stories of growth from within the third world in the context of internationalisation of capital have been countries which have pursued a relentless policy of economic nationalism, while those that pursued a 'liberal policy' have witnessed economic retrogression. East Asia and Latin America are the classic examples of the two strategies. This paper discusses the two strategies and considers the strategic options now available to third world economies such as India.||Prabhat Patnaik

Often, states attempt to address emerging natural resource problems via centralised control mechanisms. This approach is frequently ineffective and negates the interest local populations have in developing solutions to problems that affect them before all others. A basic philosophical premise underlying this paper is that local initiative represents a wellspring capable of generating innovative and implementable management solutions to many emerging problems. While local efforts are unlikely to generate solutions to all-or possibly the majority-of problems, frameworks are needed that enable local responses to emerge wherever the initiative exists.||Marcus Moench
