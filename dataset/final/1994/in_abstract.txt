In the context of environmentally sound technologies, the processing techniques for bagasse should become widely diffused in the industry to produce biomass fuel and other goods. If the existence of bagasse processing technologies is well documented, very few studies have been done on their economics. Referring mainly to the cases of Brazil and India, a look at the different costs (capital, operational, and final production cost) of technologies for drying, compacting, storing and transporting bagasse will partially explain their slow diffusion. A macroview at bagasse economics will show that the structure of the technology market is also one of the reasons for this lack of propagation. Moreover, in spite of an important potential demand, the lack of an existing market for bagasse-based products seems to be the key deterrent. The author also discusses a few conditions for the emergence of a bagasse market and the importance of pricing of bagasse.||Pierre Audinet

Adopting an alternate model and categorisation of the time period of analysis into two phases which is empirically and theoretically justified the paper observes that contrary to the findings of other researchers, not only are there distinct time trends in the incidence of rural poverty in India, but also while these trends were positive and significant in Period I (1957-58 to 1968-69), they were negative and significant in Period II (1969-70 to 1986-87). Also, the rate of decline in the incidence of rural poverty in the latter period was much higher than the rate of increase in rural poverty in the preceding period. These observations are valid for both all-India and across states, using alternate measures of poverty, i e, the head count ratio and Sen's poverty index. The paper then attempts both a time series and cross-section analysis of the causal factors behind rural poverty in India, especially probing into the role of agricultural growth, inflation, access to subsidised food through the public distribution system, population pressure on environmental resources, rural consumption levels and inequality, and infrastructure development on the incidence of rural poverty for all-India and across states. The paper suggests that policies to accelerate agricultural growth, infrastructure development and provide better access to subsidised food, along with measures to control inflation promise to be most effective in reducing the incidence of rural poverty in India. Measures to control population growth and promote environmental conservation too ought to be incorporated into anti-poverty alleviation strategies in India. The paper cautions against the implications of recent policy changes in India, viz, structural adjustments, resulting in low priority to agriculture as against industry, slashing of public expenditures on social sectors including subsidised food, etc, which are detrimental to the poor and could reverse the negative trends in rural poverty visible after 1969-70.||K.

In the context of this ongoing debate that this paper discusses the Dunkel Proposals, with special focus on its implications for the rural sector. Besides giving an overview of the main issues raised in the course of the debate, it draws attention to the major aspects of the debate specific to the particular sector under consideration-investment in services, trade-related investments, agriculture, patents, and environment-as well as to the broader issues pertaining to these proposals. The latter include issues of globalisation vs national sovereignty, promotion of domestic business vs transnational corporations, economic logic vs welfare logic, the process of creation and distribution of knowledge, environmental concerns in the wake of the new international trade regime and similar aspects of public policy.||P.

It is time to press for a law that respects the legitimate needs of people living in and around forests for their subsistence requirements, while at the same time addressing the task of environmental regeneration.||Ashwini Chhatre
10/12/1994- ||perspectives||4402125||State, Environment and Law||Law is always in formation through the articulatory processes in society and the institutions of the state. The law, state and society have to be unified in a single analytical field. The zealous concern of the law to protect and preserve forests for environmental reasons and at the same time, the neglect of environmental concerns related to pollution have to be seen in this light. The evolution of law as an interplay of state and society and interactions within the institutions of the state including the conflicts between the union and states, legislature-executive and the judiciary are explored here.||Akhileshwar Pathak

17/9/1994- ||special articles||4401788||Fate of the Forest: Conservation and Tribal Rights||The recent circulation of a draft Forest Act has once again brought into question the future of India's forests. The draft Act proposes to take a strongly conservationist stand against environmental degradation by severely restricting people's rights to the forest. How environmentally successful and socially just will such a policy be? This essay examines the experience of adivasis in Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, whose livelihood derives from their use of the forest, and who are held responsible by the state for destroying the forest. The state's persistent efforts to deny adivasi rights to the forest has resulted in an ongoing conflict that today constitutes the biggest obstacle to forest conservation. The author analyses the relationships between adivasis, the state and the forest to argue that the future of India's forests is inseparable from the future of India's adivasis. Forest conservation is possible only if people's rights are recognised and established within a larger programme of tribal development.||Amita Baviskar
