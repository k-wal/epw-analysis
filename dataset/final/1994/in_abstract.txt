26/11/1994- ||review of industry and management, november 1994||4402063||Sugarcane Bagasse: Processing Technologies and Marketing: With Reference to India and Brazil||The value of sugarcane bagasse, a by-product of the sugarcane industry, has been recognised only of late. In the context of environmentally sound technologies, the processing techniques for bagasse should become widely diffused in the industry to produce biomass fuel and other goods. If the existence of bagasse processing technologies is well documented, very few studies have been done on their economics. Referring mainly to the cases of Brazil and India, a look at the different costs (capital, operational, and final production cost) of technologies for drying, compacting, storing and transporting bagasse will partially explain their slow diffusion. A macroview at bagasse economics will show that the structure of the technology market is also one of the reasons for this lack of propagation. Moreover, in spite of an important potential demand, the lack of an existing market for bagasse-based products seems to be the key deterrent. The author also discusses a few conditions for the emergence of a bagasse market and the importance of pricing of bagasse.||Pierre Audinet

Indeed, Hitler had already found how to cure unemployment before Keynes had finished explaining why it occurred. It was a joke in Germany that Hitler was planning to give employment in straightening the Crooked Lake, painting the Black Forest white and putting down linoleum in the Polish Corridor. With the passage of time, the economic, political and cultural fallout of the Keynes-Hitler sodality has tended only to become more sinister, not less.||Narindar Singh
19/3/1994- ||special articles||4400962||From State Regulation to People's Participation: Case of Forest Management in India||Recent years have witnessed an increasing accent on people's participation in both official policy discourse at national and international levels and non-official political discourse at the level of NGOs and local voluntary agencies/organisations. Quite in line with this, the introduction of joint forest management systems (JFMS) in 11 states of India is easily promoted and readily interpreted as a major shift from state regulation towards people's participation in forest management. It is important, however, to not only examine this issue in terms of its claims but also carefully perceive and interpret these claims as well as their underlying limitations. There is a need to relate the discussions on JFMS and people's participation to wider theoretical questions about the very essence of people's participation.||Dolly Arora

The implications of the advent of a third tier in the federal structure (the panchayat) for water resource development are not yet clear. The constitutional provisions may need a review in the light of these considerations and the new perceptions of the rights of the people in relation to community resources.||Ramaswamy R. Iyer

31/12/1994- ||review of agriculture, december 1994||4402194||Farm Size, Factor Productivity and Returns to Scale under Different Types of Water Management||It used to be claimed, notably in Indian subcontinent that there is either a positive or negative significant relationship between land productivity and farm size. Attempts were made to explain the relationship using two important factors, viz, disguise unemployment and imperfection of factor markets. Solutions such as supply of inputs, land reform, etc, were suggested. Yet in poorer countries the odds are that even within a village and during any peak farm operation the question of disguise unemployment is liable to be troublesome in rice economies as these are time-specific and water management-specific. What is thus interesting and seems to have been missed out by the existing literature is that several of the factors can be exacerbated or minimised depending on the management of water in question. This article re-explores the problem on the basis of field studies in Bangladesh. The study is unable to trace any kind of significant relationship between the farm size and land productivity in both monsoon and rabi season. Instead, it appears that water management in a specific land elevation is most relevant in a village in explaining land productivity differentials.||Arindam Banik

18/6/1994- ||special articles||4401365||Poverty and Income Distribution in India||Against the background of global poverty and income distribution pattern, this paper analyses the trends and causal factors behind rural poverty in India both at the national and state levels during 1957-58 to 1986-87. Adopting an alternate model and categorisation of the time period of analysis into two phases which is empirically and theoretically justified the paper observes that contrary to the findings of other researchers, not only are there distinct time trends in the incidence of rural poverty in India, but also while these trends were positive and significant in Period I (1957-58 to 1968-69), they were negative and significant in Period II (1969-70 to 1986-87). Also, the rate of decline in the incidence of rural poverty in the latter period was much higher than the rate of increase in rural poverty in the preceding period. These observations are valid for both all-India and across states, using alternate measures of poverty, i e, the head count ratio and Sen's poverty index. The paper then attempts both a time series and cross-section analysis of the causal factors behind rural poverty in India, especially probing into the role of agricultural growth, inflation, access to subsidised food through the public distribution system, population pressure on environmental resources, rural consumption levels and inequality, and infrastructure development on the incidence of rural poverty for all-India and across states. The paper suggests that policies to accelerate agricultural growth, infrastructure development and provide better access to subsidised food, along with measures to control inflation promise to be most effective in reducing the incidence of rural poverty in India. Measures to control population growth and promote environmental conservation too ought to be incorporated into anti-poverty alleviation strategies in India. The paper cautions against the implications of recent policy changes in India, viz, structural adjustments, resulting in low priority to agriculture as against industry, slashing of public expenditures on social sectors including subsidised food, etc, which are detrimental to the poor and could reverse the negative trends in rural poverty visible after 1969-70.||K.

For their efficient and equitable performance it is imperative that their beneficiary farmers be accorded well defined and legally enforceable water rights. Conferments of such water rights by the state in the past, at the time of revenue settlements, has encouraged the formation of water users associations which help in conflict resolution among beneficiaries as also in effective maintenance of kuhls. While government support for major repairs and channel modernisation is welcome, the state needs to do much more than simply offering financial assistance for kuhl development. It should take the initiative to confer water rights also.||Ramesh Chand

But rather than attempting to reintroduce controls, for example on international capital flows, which both the ideological climate and recent technological advances make unrealistic, there is a lot to be said for getting agreements on some 'Pigovian' carrot and stick measures: that is to say, while not directly stopping anyone from doing anything, yet indirectly giving them incentives radically to change their behaviour.||G.

Its population has increased three-fold in the last two decades. The mushrooming of mainly fake small-scale industries has contributed to the unplanned growth of the city. Nouveau riche entrepreneurs, bootleggers, power brokers and other lumpens dominate the society and the administration. Water, health and sanitation, traffic and police systems are grossly inadequate and inefficient, and have failed to meet the changing needs of the city population. Absence of the state was conspicuous in the initial stages of the communal riots of 1992-93 and the current plague epidemic.

17/9/1994- ||special articles||4401788||Fate of the Forest: Conservation and Tribal Rights||The recent circulation of a draft Forest Act has once again brought into question the future of India's forests. The draft Act proposes to take a strongly conservationist stand against environmental degradation by severely restricting people's rights to the forest. How environmentally successful and socially just will such a policy be? This essay examines the experience of adivasis in Jhabua, Madhya Pradesh, whose livelihood derives from their use of the forest, and who are held responsible by the state for destroying the forest. The state's persistent efforts to deny adivasi rights to the forest has resulted in an ongoing conflict that today constitutes the biggest obstacle to forest conservation. The author analyses the relationships between adivasis, the state and the forest to argue that the future of India's forests is inseparable from the future of India's adivasis. Forest conservation is possible only if people's rights are recognised and established within a larger programme of tribal development.||Amita Baviskar
