The poorer state of health in the rural areas calls for higher priority to the provision of medical care in rural areas. The nature of the prevalent diseases and the constraints of resources warrant a less sophisticated medical technology. Finally, an integrated approach, involving immunisation, environmental sanitation, public health education, nutrition and medical care, is necessary for solving the country's health problems.||P. G.

This is mainly due to social, cultural and individual personality factors, which are complex variables not easily understandable like technological or physical resources. In developing countries like India, where Western management institutions, practices and education have been imported in a wholesale fashion, the problems of maximising managerial effectiveness get doubly compounded. In this paper, we propose to examine the nature of managerial effectiveness in the Indian environment and develop an action plan for its improvement.||R. S. Ganapathy,T. V. G. Krishnamurthy,R. V.
