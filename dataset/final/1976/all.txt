This paper describes two major types of small industrial entrepreneurs - those adopting a commercial and those adopting a production orientation - and discusses the economic factors which favour the emergence of the less appropriate, commercially-oriented, industrial entrepreneurs. The author also discusses some of the ways in which the 'quantitative restrictions' method of implementing an import substitution strategy reinforces these economic factors and spells out some policy implications of the various observations offered in the paper.||J.

The motivation of these husbands to undergo vasectomy can be enhanced by persuasion, liberalised individual incentives, 'gifts' for the child to be born or community incentives. The birth rate could be reduced markedly in about four years even if initially, most of the men (with pregnant wives) persuaded to undergo vasectomy already have three or more living children.||Anrudh K.

In districts in which farming was on the whole carried out by rich peasants and landless labourers, factional politics were likely to rule the roast. In Tanjore, the district with the largest landlords and greatest rural inequalities in Madras Presidency, factional politics was all powerful. In areas in which farming was on the whole carried out by smallholding middle peasants, political awakening had a better chance of coming by way of agitation. If the middle peasants owned their farms, as in the Andhra deltas and in Gujarat, the agitators were likely to respect the law and remain non-violent. If they did not, as in UP, the agitators were likely to become violent with a little provocation.||David Hardiman

The causes of rural poverty have to be sought in this institutional set-up. The poor peasantry is exploited under the system of semi-feudal bondage. Moreover, because of semi-feudal bondage, the rural rich have in fact a stake in perpetuating the waste and inefficiency that is characteristic of pre-capitalist modes of production.||Pradhan H.

It is the purpose of this paper to examine the assumptions of such a monetary model, with reference to India, covering the period 1951-52 to 1974-75 and to see whether the Reserve Bank can control and predict the effects of changes in its monetary liabilities on total money supply. This is essentially reduced to an examination of whether or not there is stability in the ratio of money supply to monetary liabilities of the Reserve Bank - i e, the money multiplier. The focus is on identifying the factors affecting money supply in terms of 'primary' money created by the Reserve Bank of India and 'secondary' money created by commercial banks. Such an analysis, which is in contrast to the usual presentation of data on factors affecting money supply on the basis of of the consolidated balance-sheets of the Reserve Bank and commercial banks, would help to derive the implications for monetary analysis.||Jag M.

22/5/1976- ||special articles||4364644||The Banking Structure: A Re-Appraisal||The present structure of banking has been unsuccessful in attaining the desirable kind of branch expansion and in advancing adequate credit to agriculture and other high-priority sectors, and has succeeded in creating a wasteful overlapping of services and an inefficient country-wide network of communication tangles. One has, therefore, to think of a new structure. The imperatives of the reorganised system appear clearly from the deficiencies of the existing system. We require the elimination of wasteful competition and the introduction of a system which offers banking service in depth in the areas allocated to the different units. We require regionally grouped compact zones, each served by a single public sector Zonal Bank with full stake in the development of the zone and with a quick communication link with its constituent branch offices. The argument that recent experience has not shown much economies of scale does not take into account the fact that there have been large diseconomies from the search for far-flung fields of operation: The economies of scale will appear when the scale expands within a compact area. We require a system in which monetary policy can be made quickly effective through a relatively small number of decision-making authorities, which in their turn, can effectively supervise and control the banking operations in their respective areas. And, above all, we require a system which can implement within the next ten years a programme of rural bank expansion which gives to the rural customers the full advantages of organised banking.||Bhabatosh Datta

20/3/1976- ||special articles||4364470||How Progressive Are Indian Consumption Taxes?||Indirect taxes, conventionally defined, contribute a little more than 80 per cent of the total tax revenue of the Central and state governments; and, within this, taxes on items of consumption slightly more than 70 per cent. While indirect taxation can never become a very refined method of imparting progressivity to the tax system, there is certainly no reason why indirect taxation must be regressive. What is the correct method of assessing whether or not indirect taxes in India are progressive? The Taxation Enquiry Committee of 1954-55 made the first major study of the incidence of indirect taxation for the years 1953-54. Since then, the Ministry of Finance has produced two follow-up studies, one in 1961 for the year 1958-59 and the other in 1969 for the year 1963-64. Both these studies are derivative in their methods from the original work done by the TEC. Given the fact that the latest year studied is now more than a decade in the past, it is likely that the Ministry of Finance is considering the need for a further study. For reasons of comparability, it may be inclined to bring out a third repeat exercise. The burden of this article is to suggest that this may be an approach of rather limited usefulness. After some 20 years, the original approach to this problem is due for a reappraisal. It has a number of defects which deserve wider recognition and which point to the need for a revised method of measurement.||J. F. J. Toye

However, enough time has elapsed and enough attempts have been made by Indian entrepreneurs to invest abroad, to warrant some interim stock-taking, at least to diagnose the patterns of our initial efforts and to learn possible lessons for the future. In this paper it is proposed to pursue two major strands of analyses: (1) a regional analysis of our efforts to invest abroad, and (2) an indurtry pattern of the products and technologies we have attempted to take to these countries. Interesting patterns are discernible from both these analyses and useful lessons could be drawn for the future.||K. Balakrishnan

This study, based on a socio-economic survey of six villages in the command area of the Jayakwadi Irrigation Project in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra, examines the workforce in six villages to test the popular hypothesis that rural households, particularly the poor ones, are burdened with exessive population. The evidence does not support the hypothesis. The poor households find their manpower an asset - the only significant asset that provides them income - rather than a liability. The evidence shows not only that poor households use their manpower intensively but also that this results in greater productivity per unit of whatever little material resources they have.||M. V.

The ultimate damage is done when 'grains' enter as an export item for supporting imports (that add nothing to the productive capacity of the food sector). However, so long as the surplus is there, activities in the non-agricultural sector are supported, though their forms change over time. Handicrafts are gradually replaced by the services: services for the repair of clocks, motor cars, or other durable consumer goods, hotel, bar and restaurant services, English medium schools and bands for playing English music then gradually come into being. The important point to note here is that deindustrialisation and commercialisation of agriculture are but manifestations of the same process. Probably the most dramatic consequence of the process is the famine-proneness of the economy as better quality and irrigated land is diverted to the export-sector and food production is left at the mercy of the weather gods. In a year of good harvest, employment in the non-agricultural sector is supported through the food surplus. But in a year of poor harvest the incidence of unemployment and starvation is heaviest in the non-agricultural sector of the economy.||M. K. Rakshit
1/2/1976- ||industrial growth patterns||4364368||Growth and Stagnation in Indian Industrial Development||One can discern two striking features of the growth process in the industrial sector. One is the emergence of a significant quantum of unutilised manufacturing capacity; the other is a sharp decline in the rate of growth of industrial output since the middle 1960s. The emergence of unutilised capacity and the decline in the rate of growth of output taken together are clearly a matter for serious concern. Estimates of unutilised manufacturing capacity are relatively few and vary a great deal. Their conceptual and statistical bases are also often not precise enough for one to be sure how much reliance can be placed on them. However, what is really important to undertake now is not a more comprehensive or accurate measurement of industrial capacity, but an analysis of the factors governing the demand for manufactured products. This paper attempts such an analysis with a view to bringing out the main reasons for the trends in industrial output that have been in evidence over the last decade and indicating some of the inferences that can be drawn about the future course of industrial development in the country.||K.

The distinguishing mark of this new chapter of history is the unequal exchange. Flows of royalty, profits, dividends, etc, are but a small trickle compared to what is being extracted from the third world by the imperialist countries through unequal exchange in international trade. Unequal exchange is an important issue, both in its theory and in its empirical ramification. But it has not yet drawn much attention in India. This essay is intended to open a discussion, which is all the more urgent in as much as the endeavours to construct a theory of unequal exchange have failed to capture the essence of the problem.||Ranjit Sau

11/12/1976- ||special articles||4365170||Kaleckian Perspective on Modern Capitalism||Kalecki argued that the institutional framework of a social system is a fundamental component of its economic dynamics and, therefore, of the growth theory relevant to that system. Kelecki distinguished three major ways of generating effective demand in a modern capitalist economy, and he reflected about their adequacy and relative efficiency in achieving and supporting full employment. He concentrated on the relative merits of (a) deficit spending; (b) stimulating private investment; and (c) redistributing income from higher to lower income groups. Kalecki's concentration was that in the main (b) is not sufficient and not satisfactory, but both (a) and (c), subject to an appropriate monetary policy and supporting measures (or neutralising adverse circumstances), provide adequate, but not necessarily equally satisfactory, means for permanent maintenance of full employment. Kalecki underscored that much would depend on the institutional set up of the regime of full employment. Kalecki saw that the process of estabishing full employment could be used as a vehicle to effect basic changes in the capitalist system in the direction of what he considered a more just distribution of national income and towards advancing the standard of living of the masses. He saw the opportunity, but he was mindful of the grave problems that this would entail. Whatever the rationale of the arguments of the economics of full employment, the political problems involved in achieving and maintaining full employment are formidable. Kalecki's prediction of the political business cycle is likely to rank in importance with his role as protagonist and 'generaliser' of the general theory of employment.||George R. Feiwel

This paper is mainly devoted to outlining a suggested criterion, termed the labour-exploitation criterion, for demarcating classes within the peasantry at the empirical level - as this is an essential preliminary step before we can apply class categories to the analysis of agrarian change. Secondly, it is argued that even the very limited questions posed by the 'neoclassical' theory cannot be answered meaningfully by that theory because it abstracts from class analysis; additionally, there are a whole range of questions which that theory is not even capable of posing.||Utsa Patnaik

The leading questions to which P B Pandit addressed himself - chiefly problems of cultural interaction and change in a plural society - are of concern to all social scientists. And his approach to these questions as a professional linguist, may well suggest to students of related disciplines new ways of conceptualising such problems and of interpreting the ethnolinguistic complexities of India as a civilisation or culture area.||Patricia Uberoi,J.

The dispersion of growth rates about the mean is, however, found to be significantly different between the small, medium and large firms - the standard deviation generally tending to decline as we go from small to higher sized firms. The independence of growth and size is further established by the insignificance of size in explaining growth and the lack of persistence in rates of growth. Further, the size distribution of firms is skewed and approximates to log-normal distribution; and there is a strong tendency of firms to stay in the same class. Increase or decrease in size is a common feature of firms in all size groups and, therefore, there is no tendency for all the firms to get clustered in the highest size class. Thus the distribution has a tendency to remain the same over time. It would thus appear that Gibrat's law has a tendency to operate in the Indian basic chemical industry, though mildly. A major implication of this finding is that small, medium and large firms have an equal chance of growing. This conclusion has a special significance for policy for small-scale industry.||D. P.

22/5/1976- ||special articles||4364645||The Formative Ideology of Jawaharlal Nehru||The ambivalences of Jawaharlal Nehru's ideology were to be embarrassing and sometimes even dangerous in the years after 1947 when they dominated his thinking, and that of the large number in India who followed his lead, because it necessarily meant a dilution of the thrust of policy. Looking back today at the ideology of Asian and African nationalism, Nehru's efforts at formulating a coherent body of thought and practice seem halting, incomplete, and perhaps circumscribed by his class background. But this is where Nehru has suffered from the hindsight of the historian. To do him justice, it should be remembered that he was also the pioneer. So long as nationalism in colonial countries was the comfortable monoply of only the middle class, there was no need to strive for a well-thought-out philosophy of action. They realised, without much close argument, what to demand or to concede, when to resist, where to push. But once nationalism became a heterogeneous social movement, this monopoly of the middle class was broken, and it became Nehru's burden to find for nationalism an ideology which would hold the various classes together. If Nehru in the years before 1947, which is what this paper is concerned with, now appears shaky, hesitant and faltering, we should remind ourselves that most of the more clear-sighted exponents of nationalist thought in Asia and Africa are, in a sense, standing on Nehru's shoulders.||S.

An escape from underdevelopment requires, among other things, an alternative technology. Alternative technology must concern itself not only with the technical aspects of the problem but also with the socio-economic and political ones. As a problem of the scientists, alternative technology becomes indistinguishable from the broader questions of social upheaval and social betterment for the majority.||Vinod Vyasulu

A second aim is to examine critically the ideas on famines outlined by Thomas Robert Malthus in his "An Investigation of the Cause of the Present High Price of Provisions" (1800), which provided one of the most clear accounts of the 'food availability' approach in an exchange economy - an account that can stand even without presupposing his theory of population. An evaluation of Malthus' analysis of famines helps to identify some of the inherent weaknesses of the food availability approach in the context of an exchange economy. Finally, the 'exchange entitlements' approach is illustrated with some facts relating to the Bengal Famine of 1943.||Amartya Sen

In an earlier paper the present author had analysed admissions data relating to one of the leading institutes of management. The major conclusion of that paper was that although sufficiently large numbers of candidates belonging to different income groups applied for admission, candidates from higher income groups stood a much better chance of getting admitted to the institute than those from lower income groups. Similarly, candidates having received their previous education from English-medium public or missionary schools and colleges had an edge over their counterparts whose earlier education was at non-English-medium schools and colleges, usually run by the government or local bodies. And, finally, candidates from large metropolitan centres were found to be over-represented while those from rural areas were grossly under-represented. These issues are further examined here in the light of the new findings.||Baldev R. Sharma

10/7/1976- ||special articles||4364781||Surplus Labour in Agriculture: Some Estimates||A large part of unemployment and underempl oyment in agriculture arises out of the seasonality factor: there are busy periods and lean periods. Any attempt to estimate surplus labour in agriculture without considering the seasonality of employment would give an incorrect picture of the real situation, especially of the amount of surplus labour available to be used for capital formation elsewhere in the economy. Using data for Ferozepur district from the Studies in the Economics of Farm Management for 1967-68 to 1969-70, an attempt is made in this paper to estimate, first, the total surplus labour in agriculture to get an idea of how far agriculture provides employment to those who are fully engaged in it. The author then estimates separately the extent of surplus labour which is removable and the extent of seasonal surplus labour.||Ashok K. Mitra

They include: (i) a substantial degree of control by transnational enterprises of marketing outlets for manufactured products in the industrialised countries - through brand names, market concentration at the wholesale and/or retail level, and other barriers to entry; (ii) highly imperfect markets for the relevant technologies, with Western technology owners facing ill-informed and competitive Third World purchasers: (iii) a large number of low-income countries all seeking to develop exports of a similar type, and therefore competing - with far less bargaining power than in the cases where they possess a scarce natural resource or the rights to domestic market access - against one another to sell their labour and other services to foreign firms; (iv) high tariff and non-tariff barriers against their manufactured exports in their major prospective markets, with the political pressure for their reduction or removal emanting only from the transnational enterprises to which the less developed countries sell; (v) the absence of international conventions or rules which might protect the less developed countries against discriminatory treatment, the GATT having formally authorised such treatment in the case of textiles and failed to adopt procedures to prevent future similar events; (vi) the frequent practice of transnational enterprises controlling the right to export on the part of subsidiaries or technology purchasers, in the absence of international laws or conventions prohibiting such restrictive practices; (vii) the weak administrative capacity and political power of the typical government in the less developed countries which renders difficult the process of effective bargaining, monitoring and control with respect to foreign agreements, and transnational enterprises. Whether these difficulties are enough to greatly reduce or even to absolutely cancel the potential gains from the "new international division of labour" will depend, in large part, upon the policies of governments both in developed and in less developed countries. In the absence of measures designed to forestall these outcomes, they seem likely at least to result in a highly unequal distribution of the gains from trade as between the less developed countries and the industrialised world and to create new dimensions of political and economic dependence.||G.

To begin with, an outline of the Kautsky-Lenin laws and the limits of capitalism in agriculture is given in section I. The operation of these laws in a colonial or semi-colonial milieu is examined in section II. Then we come to India, in particular, in section III. It seems to us that the controversy about the extent of capitalist development in Indian agriculture has been marred by certain conceptual ambiguity. Section IV makes an attempt to help clear the air. The last section contains a few concluding remarks.||Ranjit Sau

17/7/1976- ||special articles||4364798||Agribusiness in Underdeveloped Agricultures: Harvard Business School Myths and Reality||In the non-socialist underdeveloped countries there has begun a transformation of the traditional resource-use pattern in agriculture in terms of intensification and diversification of land uses whose consequences would only be a dramatic worsening of the food and resource situation. With the world-wide expansion of capitalism into underdeveloped agricultures under the guidance and control of the industrial countries and their multinational concerns we must soon expect chaotic food conditions, a depletion of agricultural resources at speeds surpassing by a wide margin the resource-wastes of traditional agricultures, a geometric increase in rural and urban poverty and unemployment and consequent inevitable famines. This expansion of capitalism which goes under the name of 'modernisation' represents an aggravation of the traditional agricultural systems with all their defects and vices, but at a much higher level of sophistication. Channelling of resources to the large landholders in the form of new capital and modern technology has the effect of widening the already existing gap in wealth, income and power between the land monopolists and the peasants. This conscious strategy, supported by a multitude of agencies, is bound to increase the contradictions inherent in underdeveloped agricultures through eviction of smallholders, through rise in rural unemployment and underemployment and through deterioration in the conditions of wage employment.||Ernest Feder

30/10/1976- ||special articles||4365057||Air Pollution in Bombay: The Emissions Charge Approach||While all-round proportional cutbacks of emissions may superficially seem the most equitable way of sharing the pollution burden, such a system is certainly not efficient, nor is it as equitable as implementing the equimarginal principle through a charge. Under the latter system while low control cost polluters bear more of the abatement burden than high control cost polluters (resulting in efficiency) this is more than offset by the fact that they have to pay the charge on a relatively smaller amount of unabated emissions resulting in equity. Thus the burden of internalising social costs is borne by consumers in proportion to pollution generated, which should have the appropriate resource allocation effects. The income distribution implications will have to be investigated for each particular case. However, in view of its obvious theoretical and practical advantages this approach deserves consideration as a possible component of an air pollution control programme for Bombay. Parts of Bombay's air pollution problem may be amenable to the emissions charge approach.||P. B. Ghate
27/11/1976- ||review of management, november 1976||4365133||Operations Research: Some Experimental Applications||It was in the late 1930s that the Royal Air Force, while experimenting with new radar stations, made the revolutionary discovery that the scientific placing of radar stations was a problem quite distinct from the technological one of making individual stations work reliably. What was even more revolutionary was the choice of leading physical and biological scientists to solve the problem. This use of the scientific method of enquiry to solve an operational as opposed to a theoretical problem came to be known as Operational Research. In view of the circumstances of its origin and growth, OR has come to be seen as merely a way of tackling problems by breaking them into smaller problems to make them analytically tractable; the larger institutional causes of these problems are considered outside the ken of OR. The present paper questions these assumptions and proposes some alternative applications of OR.||N. Tyabji

The various movements in South Bihar and Santhal Parganas were not apparently 'political' before 1940s; they only aimed at tribal awakening and social and economic uplift. But later on the leaders of the movements realised that unless they ejected the north Bihar leaders and other 'outsiders' from positions of power and authority, they would not be able to deliver their own people. This paper argues that the basic forces underlying these movements were economic and ethnic and not 'political'; the 'political culture' of the movements was a strategy or a consequence of these forces rather than a determining factor.||K.

03/4/1976- ||special article||4364513||McNamara's Little Green Revolution: World Bank Scheme for Self-Liquidation of Third World Peasantry||It has now become obvious that the process of capitalist expansion in third world agricultures, part of which is known by the pleasant title 'the green revolution' and which consisted in massive transfers of capital and technology from the industrial nations, particularly the USA, first to the landed oligarchy and subsequently to agriculture-related industries and services, has had disastrous consequences for the rural proletariat, the small-holder and the landless, who make up the overwhelming majority of the rural labour force in the underdeveloped countries. The direct results of the so-called green revolution have been sharply increased concentration of land ownership, massive dispossession of small-holders, proliferation of landless workers, rural unemployment, poverty, hunger and increase in the domination of the multinational concerns over production and distribution of agricultural products and inputs. The World Bank contributed effectively to these developments through its lending policies. The widening disparities in income and wealth, however, threatened the very foundations of worldwide capitalism and the continued dependence of the underdeveloped countries on the industrial nations. Something had to be done to counter this trend. The World Bank, therefore, came up in 1973 with a proposal to help the rural poor. McNamara's response to the challenge of the disastrous failure of the much propagandised big green revolution was to propose a little green revolution. This paper examines the concept of the little green revolution and its consequences for the rural poor in the underdeveloped countries.||Ernest Feder

It is, perhaps, the nineteenth-century Anglo-Saxon tradition which makes us think of trade as creating growth. For the bulk of this century, it is growth that has been creating trade. We all know what happens when the activity indexes in the United States begin to nod and to dip. The undue deference to trade is all the more sad, because the present foundations of even static trade theory are not solid enough to rest weighty policy-prescriptions upon.||Pramit Chaudhuri

The aim of this paper is twofold: to review the empirical evidence about China's socio-economic achievements and to examine how the Chinese experience has taken the course it has - in other words, to provide an up-to-date integrated survey of China's macroeconomic performance and social welfare record, and of the theory and policy which have underlain them. The issues focused on here are, first, the evidence for and against the widespread view that, despite considerable achievements in the social welfare field, Chinese macroeconomic performance has been at best modest; second, the debate over whether or not inequities have been reduced substantially; third, the theory underlying the primarily economic aspects of the Maoist strategy for development; and, fourth, the policies used to implement the Maoist strategy and the extent of their success.||Suzanne Paine

Indeed, in the world of today, they represent an important part of the development strategy for several poor countries. This occurrence is rather interesting for two reasons. First, trade between the socialist countries and the Third World is now one of the most dynamic components of world commerce. Second, and more important, it represents a strengthening of ties between two sets of countries with entirely different political and economic systems. It would be worthwhile, therefore, to examine the nature of this relationship and its implications for the poor.||Deepak Nayyar

Section II of the paper attempts to relate the regional variations in the extent of tenancy to differences in (a) intensity of irrigation, (b) fluctuations of rainfall, (c) labour-intensity of crops, (d) degree of landlord's monopoly power in the land market, (e) unemployment of landless labour, and (f) imperfections in the credit market. A number of hypotheses on the impact of these factors on tenancy are tested econometrically. Section III similarly tests hypotheses about factors governing the regional variations in forms of tenancy, particularly in the relative importance of share-cropping vis-a-vis tenancy contracts with a fixed rent per acre. Section IV examines the size-distribution of tenants. The author discusses, in particular the regional variations in the size-distribution of tenants and whether technological and economic factors may explain these variations. The last Section V observes the nature of changes in the extent and form of tenancy over the last two decades, particularly how tenancy contracts are being reshaped by the forces of agricultural progress with special reference to those regions which have achieved a significant breakthrough in production in recent times. The article is published in two parts. Sections I, II and III appear below and Sections IV and V will be published next week.||Pranab Bardhan

It is sadder still to see the multinational drug companies importing even today intermediates not "as near to the basic chemicals as possible" but "as near to the final product as possible'. The story of formulations is no less sad. The multinational firms have introduced a large number of formulations in the market which a poor country can well do without. As a result the therapeutic field has been so "polluted" that unless drastic measures are taken the industry will continue to play on the gullibily of patients and physicians alike. The hollowness of the arguments in support of retaining brand names of drugs is evident from the fact that in day-to-day medical practice general practitioners who dispense medicines themselves to their patients purchase their requirements of formulations in bulk as generic products because of their low cost. However, the stakes are so high in the battle of brand names that the multinationals can be expected to use all the resources at their command to resist any attempt to touch brand names. The government's reported decision to do away with brand names in the case of a few drugs reflects a halting approach to the problem. Unless a bold decision is taken, the impact on prices resulting from the abolition of brand names will be hardly visible.||

These measures include higher acceptor incentives, group incentives, multi-media communication strategy, and the offering of an integrated package of health, family planning and nutrition. The present paper argues that greater success in family planning programmes can be achieved by increased efforts towards changing attitudes than by merely disseminating information about family planning more widely. This can be achieved by instituting changes in the implementation of the family planning programme, its organisational structure and process, and the training of family planning workers.||J. K. Satia

27/3/1976- ||review of agriculture, march 1976||4364488||Internationalisation of Capital and Mode of Production in Agriculture||In this essay, the author begins by sketching three cycles of struggle and the associated theoretical formulations. By so doing, he hopes to show some of the politics of the debate and, at the same time, its limitations as a basis for working class strategy. Having summarised this historical background, linking theory and politics, he then outlines a new theoretical structure which has emerged from a somewhat different political perspective. This theory and perspective seem to offer more hope of understanding the 'political economy of agriculture', and more of a chance to change it than others. The perspective focuses on two key aspects of capital. First, it takes seriously the notion that capital is a social relation of class struggle, and recognises that within that struggle the working class is not merely reactive but has autonomous power to initiate action in its interests. Second, by beginning the analysis of capital from the point of view of the whole - the aggregate social capital - we see the crucial importance of the wageless within capital, within the class struggle. This involves a reconceptualisation of the reserve army as one which is a part of the working class, because it works - reproducing itself and even producing a commodity surplus for capital. The division waged/unwaged thus appears not as a sign of work/nonwork for capital but as a basic division imposed on the class. This perspective suggests that one way of approaching precapitalist 'modes of production' in the Third World - and which recognises them (and the struggles of their exploited classes) as integral to the world capitalist system - is as subdivisions of the unwaged. Finally, with this perspective in hand, the author turns to the implications of this approach for understanding the situation in India.||Harry Cleaver

17/4/1976- ||special articles||4364550||Capitalist Development and Underdevelopment: Towards a Marxist Critique of Samir Amin||"Rich in insights and panoramic in scope as it is, Amin's book under review will remain a lasting contribution to the theory of capitalist development, and the practice of the struggle for national economic liberation in the three continents of Asia, Africa and Latin America." This is the opinion of a previous reviewer of Samir Amin's book, "Accumulation on a World Scale: A Critique of the Theory of Underdevelopment", in these columns. Such a view implies a belief that Amin's book constitutes an advance in our understanding of capitalism as it has developed, and as it exists, in the world today. A Marxist reading the book, however, gets a very different impression. What is the reason for the difference? This paper tries to provide an answer to this question. It is not, therefore, a finished critique of Amin's work, but is merely an attempt to point out its basic weakness and suggest the lines along which a Marxist critique might be developed.||Rohini Hensman

The author analyses the reproductive behaviour of two social groups that form the bulk of the population in the Indian social formation: the working peasantry and the unemployed. He tries to delineate those historically created social relations that explain the reproductive behaviour of these groups. The author hopes to show, first, that it is not high population growth that explains India's poverty but the contrary; and, second, that this poverty itself is not a natural but a historical phenomenon: its reproduction cannot be understood unless we analyse it as the result of social relations which themselves must be placed in the context of a system of oppression - imperialism.||Mahmood Mamdani

There has been nevertheless a steady increase in recruitment of scheduled castes in banks over the last three years. However, the total percentage of scheduled castes has not reached the stipulated level. There is a significant difference between recruitment of scheduled castes at different levels. As against the 15 per cent of vacancies reserved for them, only 3 per cent at the officer's level and 8 per cent at the clerical level are filled, while at the sub-staff level the quota has been completely filled by most banks. In other words, the majority of the scheduled castes employed in banks are still at the lowest levels. This fact is also noticed in other government offices and public sector undertakings.||A.

Both between- and within-state disparities are discussed, with the emphasis on the latter. An attempt is also made to gauge whether there has been any significant shift in regional disparities over time and NSS 13th round (September 1957-May 1958) household budget data have been used for the purpose.||G.

Conditions in public sector industry are changing. Increasing professionalisation of management, a greater sophistication of management practices through the adoption of modern management ideas and techniques, a deliberate effort to bring greater resilience and adaptability to the rules and procedures are distinctly in evidence. Personnel management and industrial relations practices too have become more modernised and at least the institutional framework, if not the essence, of collective bargaining has been developed in most public enterprises. The level of workers' emoluments has risen considerably and in the matter of implementation of labour laws, managements of public enterprises no longer seek special privileges. Even labour participation in management is reported to have been seriously launched in a number of enterprises. At the interface between the enterprise on the one hand and government and parliament on the other, however, one does not see change coming with comparable speed. In the absence of adequate changes at this interface, there are very definite limits to the degree to which basic changes in the management of public enterprises will be feasible.||Bagaram Tulpule

A Critique of the 'Informal Sector' Concept: II: A Fragmented Labour Market||This paper examines the utility of the concept of the 'informal sector'. The author argues, partly on the basis of research into labour relations in a small town in western India, that the concept of the informal sector is analytically inadequate. The informal sector, he suggests, cannot be demarcated as a separate economic compartment and/or labour situation. In Part I of the article it is argued that any attempt to demarcate the informal sector will give rise to numerous inconsistencies and difficulties. Moreover, by interpreting the relationship of the informal sector to the formal sector in a dualistic framework and by focussing on the mutually exclusive characteristics, we lose sight of the unity and totality of the productive system. In Part II of the article, the author suggests that rather than divide the urban system into two segments, it is preferable to emphasise the fragmented nature of the entire labour market. Finally, in Part III, the author considers the social classes which are usually associated with the urban labour force. [Part I of the article appeared last week and Part III will be published next week.]||Jan Breman

In Section I the existing measures are reviewed. In Section II the nature of inflation which the above measures are expected to attack is analysed with the help of data for the past 15 years. In Section III a few conclusions are set out. Briefly, the study reveals that the inflationary situation in India is more of a demand-pull nature and less of a cost-push type. Once the demand-pull forces are controlled the subsidiary cost-push factors will take care of themselves.||V. A. Avadhani

Instead, if efforts were made to overcome the obstructions in the way of implementation of the Fifth Plan strategy of having a package of effective health, nutrition and family planning services as a part of the Minimum Needs Programme, it would yield much better results, demographically, socially and politically.||D.

On the one hand, classical and neo-classical theses derived from Smith and Ricardo advocate an international division of labour and extension of the market through free trade and comparative advantage which lead to the specialisation by some countries in the production and export of staple raw materials for the external market in exchange for manufactures produced in other countries. On the other hand, the theses associated with Friedrich List, Gunnar Myrdal, Raul Prebisch and lately A Emmanuel seek to challenge the classical thesis by invoking secular trends in the terms of trade or/and chronic unequal exchange that disfavour the low wage raw materials producers and recommend an alternative policy of infant industry protection and import substitution for the development of the internal market. The abstract treatment of the problems of division of labour and the extent of the market in isolation from the concrete reality of the historical process of world capital accumulation - as is traditional with neo-classical and Keynesian as distinct from Marxist economists - necessarily prevents their satisfactory solution. Similarly, the voluntaristic development policies associated with such abstractions in place of the dictates of objective reality are also destined to fail.||Andre Gunder Frank

There seems to be enough evidence in recent years to suggest that the picture is not so simple. While a large number of really weak tenants have lost whatever security they had, the dominant class is extending its operational control on land through leasing in. Even if concentration in ownership declines, concentration in operational holdings need not. In fact, the latter concentration is tending to be larger than the former. This paper provides further evidence of this developing contradiction in land reforms from a survey of six villages conducted on the eve of introduction of regular irrigation. It analyses the impact of leasing behaviour on the concentration in operational holdings and studies the class nature of non-cultivating owners of land. In the light of land transfers in the past, it is feared that this trend may further accelerate in the area after the introduction of full-scale irrigation. What makes this development significant is that this is a part of a country-wide phenomenon. Hence, it is necessary for policy-makers to think afresh about where the trust of land reforms should be, if these reforms are intended to be meaningful.||M. V. Nadkarni

Science Policy is not mere allocation and institutional management of funds and resources provided for R and D; in its broadest sense, it concerns itself with the generation of new knowledge and its application to the development of society. Thus, Science Policy inherently involves consideration not only of the economist, the sociologist and the philosopher, but also of the political leadership. The present paper discusses Science Policy in India as it was formulated in the Science Policy Resolution of 1958 under the direction of Jawaharlal Nehur, the various constraints within which it has had to function, the measures taken to implement it.||Dhirendra Sharma

Section II of the paper attempts to relate the regional variations in the extent of tenancy to differences in (a) intensity of irrigation, (b) fluctuations of rainfall, (c) labour-intensity of crops, (d) degree of landlord's monopoly power in the land market, (e) unemployment of landless labour, and (f) imperfections in the credit market. A number of hypotheses on the impact of these factors on tenancy are tested econometrically. Section III similarly tests hypotheses about factors governing the regional variations in forms of tenancy, particularly in the relative importance of share-cropping vis-a-vis tenancy contracts with a fixed rent per acre. Section IV examines the size-distribution of tenants. The author discusses, in particular, the regional variations in the size-distribution of tenants and whether technological and economic factors may explain these variations. The last Section V observes the nature of changes in the extent and form of tenancy over the last two decades, particularly how tenancy contracts are being reshaped by the forces of agricultural progress with special reference to those regions which have achieved a significant breakthrough in production in recent times. The article is published in two parts. Sections I, II and III appeared last week and Sections IV and V are published below.||Pranab Bardhan

1/8/1976- ||jobs and people||4364838||Settlements, People and Jobs||As a result of the unprecedented growth of the world economy since the Second World War, there has been a systematic increase in the expectation of life at birth and in the general health status. This achievement has, however, been interpreted as a catastrophe. The system's capacity to employ, let alone house, the people it has ensured stay alive has been shrinking. The disjuncture is not simply between the supply of workers and the availability of jobs, but the areas where the available labour force has increased are not those where jobs are most easily created. When governments are unable to raise the rate of creation of jobs - or even to sustain the existing level of jobs - they are almost invariably tempted to make the job-seeker the scapegoat. Whether it is the argument that there are too many people - rather than too few jobs - or that migration should be curbed, controlled or rendered illegal, the efforts are of the same kind: meeting the inability to sustain economic growth by an assault on the victims of this failure. An examination of the redistribution of the population allows us to see the common character of the process and the absence of any universal 'flood' of people between areas. It helps to bring prescriptions back to the basic task: economic development.||Nigel Harris

This analysis is carried over in toto in all official, and academic, publications and discussions on the subject. Presumably, it also serves as a basis for the formulation and evaluation of monetary policy. This paper attempts to show that the Reserve Banks analysis of the factors affecting money supply is not empirically meaningful and leads to faulty analytical and policy conclusions. It is, therefore, in urgent need of revision. The paper is divided into six sections. Beginning with the empirical definitions of the key terms in the analysis (Section I), the author goes on to discuss briefly the theory of money supply in Section II. The Reserve Bank's analysis of money supply is critically examined in Section III. Sections IV and V are devoted to a discussion of the relation between government borrowing from banks and money supply - a relation about which there seems to be widespread misunderstanding. In the last section we suggest an alternative scheme for the publishing of the Reserve Bank's analysis of the factors affecting money supply in place of its present scheme.||Suraj B. Gupta

The three key areas discussed are: training medical manpower, redistribution of health manpower from urban to rural areas and utilisation of practitioners of indigenous medicine. The examination brings out that while the broad principles of Chinese rural health policy are relevant to India, the task of implementing egalitarian health policies through the existing elite system will not be easy. The Chinese experience suggests that neither a general commitment to socialism nor concentration of power in the hands of a small political-administrative elite can become an adequate mechanism for major social changes. Only a leadership determined to restructure both attitudes and power relationships within the political-administrative system will succeed. Such a restructuring must involve, among other things, de-bureaucratisation and decentralisation of power to the people.||Rushikesh M. Maru

A knowledge of some of these is, therefore, essential before launching an MBO programme in an organisation, especially when management development and managerial effectiveness are its focus. This paper deals with some of the important variables of organisational reality. Section II deals with 'power and influence', Section III with 'authority', Section IV with 'performance appraisal' and Section V with 'objectives'. These variables have been discussed separately because of their operational significance and the particularly crucial role they play in MBO. In Section VI an attempt has been made to relate these variables to a common end-result variable: 'managerial effectiveness'.||S. K. Chakraborty

It gradually deprives a large number of small, self-sufficient, producers of their means of production. The means of production become items of investment. These get concentrated in fewer and fewer hands. The pauperised peasants are left with nothing to sell but their labour power, which itself becomes a commodity. This is precisely the commodity needed by the capitalist for his production. Disintegration of the large number of self-dependent production units, at the same stroke, creates markets for consumption goods. Hence pauperisation of small producers is an essential element in capitalist growth. This paper attempts to find out what is happening to the economy of small farmers in Punjab.||B. D. Talib,A. Majid

However, it is premature to think of introducing compulsory sterilisation. Persuasion, supplemented by monetary compensation as well as individual and group incentives and disincentives, remains the best policy. Despite the efficacy of sterilisation for family limitation, the criterion for incentives and disincentives should be the number of children and not evidence of sterilisation. In other words, the individual couples must be free to choose the method of family planning. There is need for a substantial improvement in the quantity as well as the quality of work performed by the family planning field workers, but indiscriminate sanctions are likely to be self-defeating and might encourage unscrupulous actions. Innovative suggestions for 'no-birth' years imply an objective of a reduction in the absolute size of population because 'no-death' years are not feasible; they are totally unrealistic.||Pravin Visaria

First, an integrated programme for commodities was adopted, containing most of the principles and objectives proposed by the developing countries. Second, it was agreed that a negotiating conference on a common commodity stabilisation fund would be held not later than March 1977. Finally, it was agreed that individual commodity negotiations would be held on a number of products, starting in September 1976 with a target completion date at the end of 1978. It is probable that in March 1977, the 77 will establish the common commodity stabilisation fund. Without the fund, the financially weak developing country producers, unable to carry stocks and pressed for foreign exchange, would continue to be compelled to sell competitively on a falling market the commodity surpluses which periodically inevitably arise when production is highly variable and cannot be adjusted quickly to demand. It is such distress sales and sales of speculative stocks which have disastrous effects on prices and incomes of all developing country commodity producers. And it is for this reason that for these countries as a group the fund has become a symbol of equal power in decision-making in the world economy.||Dragoslav Avramovic

Some of these attempts, based on the data collected for the Studies in the Economics of Farm Management pertaining to the mid-fifties and the mid-sixties, show interesting results which have far-reaching implications for policy purposes. However, insufficient appreciation of the difference in the sampling design of the Farm Management Surveys at the two points of time has rendered at least some of these analyses and results of doubtful validity.

This change demands considerable retraining and utilisation of skills on a purposive and pragmatic basis. Given the spread and distribution of large loans as also the connotations of resource utilisation and risk, these skills are best utilised by constituting large commercial-cum-international banking branches in metropolitan and semi-metropolitan cities by weaning them from current main branch operations. The creation of service groups to provide customer services at one focal point and the opening of special service branches for handling clearing work for other branches would substantially improve the effectiveness of the proposed credit administration process and structure.||S.

But despite being a highly industrialised country, the stratification of Japanese society presents some peculiarities which cannot be explained entirely in terms of class, determined by birth and educational qualifications, as understood in many Western societies. In Japan, within the vertical organisation of an institution - say the government, industry, academic institutions, etc - there are horizontal classifications which are determined not by status, but by the jobs held. Social mobility in Japan is invariably within these horizontal classifications.||William H. Newell

This rise has been attributed to the impact of the so-called Green Revolution. The data presented in this note shows, however, that in one of the main Green Revolution regions, viz, western UP, real wages showed no tendency to rise over the period 1959-60 to 1973-74. What is more, after 1970-71, real wages declined steadily.||Rohini Nayyar

As on March 31, 1972, the inter-state range in per capita expenditures had a ratio of 1 to 3. Several hypotheses are possible. But the mere statement of hypotheses and their theoretical backdrop do not give any credence to the expenditure differentials, unless they are empirically tested. In what follows, an attempt is made to find out the determinants of expenditure differentials by applying multiple regression analysis. Of the five determinants - per capita income, density of population, and urbanisation, - per capita federal aid, and per capita debt services - the last two explain much of the variance in expenditures of 1962 and 1972, respectively. A suitable policy coupled with appropriate federal transfers and debt policy of states may help reduce disparities in social consumption.||K. N. Reddy

Much of the effort which contributed to the development of public health, including malaria control, could only be understood as part and parcel of the interplay of social conflicts attendant upon economic growth and development. In particular, public health has played a key role in the on-going struggle of people for better lives and the demands of business and government for social order and reinvestible resources. What has been lacking in the various evaluations of the continuing failure of the Indian malaria eradication programme is a broader perspective which would seek to explain not only the degree of programme inadequacy but also the reasons for it. The various analyses have themselves failed to come to grips with the larger problems. By remaining narrowly focused on the programme itself, they have not questioned the reasons for the changing place of malaria control within the overall pattern of government socio-economic policy. Because of this failure the reports have not responded to the broader questions raised by some critics who have doubted the very possibility of reform under the present system.||Harry Cleaver

This is explained partly by the fact that our scientific infrastructure is very much conditioned by the factor-use bias of the developed countries and partly by the influence exerted by the affluent segments within our farm sector, for whom substitution of capital for labour has become increasingly profitable. Varietal improvements which may not raise yield per cropped acre but reduce the crop duration significantly, can enable a significant increase in output and employment by facilitating multiple cropping. There is, therefore, a need to evolve land-augmenting technologies with labour-use bias so as to suit the labour-abundant and capital scarce regions during the initial stages of their development.||C.

24/1/1976- ||special articles||4364352||African Liberation Struggle: In Continental and International Perspective||This paper proposes to examine some aspects and problems of the changing imperialist strategy and the everdeveloping anti-imperialist struggle in Africa, viewed as a dialectical unity of opposites. Specifically, it will examine some of the salient features and trends of development of imperialist policies and anti-imperialist struggles in Africa over the past some 15 years - from 1960, the so-called 'Year of Africa', to 1975, which may rightfully be designated as the Year of Mozambique. On the positive side, these two dates mark a qualitative transition from the first flowers of African independence to the first fruits of African liberation. On the negative side, though, and as a bitter reminder of the great persistence and power of imperialism, they mark, too, the transition from the first Congo crisis to the present civil war in Angola, both equally products of imperialist rivalry, power-politics and intrigue. The analysis is intended to focus, in particular, on the possible repercussions for Africa and the African people's liberation struggle, of the total defeat of US imperialism in Indochina, as well as of the complete disintegration of Portuguese colonialism in Africa.||Jitendra Mohan

13/11/1976- ||special articles||4365096||India's Terms of Trade: 1871-72 to 1892-93||This study of India's terms of trade from 1871-72 to 1892-93 suggests (a) that it is highly improbable that India's net merchandise terms of trade declined between 1871-72 and 1892-93, (b) that it is almost certain that there was an upward trend between 1876-77 and 1892-93, though it was much weaker than that between 1876-77 and 1881-82, and (c) that the trend between 1882-83 and 1892-93 was upwards though one gets a downward movement between 1884-85 and 1891-92. Except for the period between 1876-79 and 1884-85, the decline in the exchange value of the rupee exerted a downward pressure on the net merchandise terms of trade, though its force was probably weakened by the large share enjoyed by a few items (e g, cotton piecegoods), in the Indian import trade. This downward pressure was more than offset by the fall in (gold) prices particularly in the UK (the most important source of Indian imports), and the fall in oceanic freights which tended to push down the index of unit value of imports (in rupee terms). The net merchandise terms of trade of both India and the UK vis-a-vis each other might improve on account of the steep decline in oceanic freights.||Nabendu Sen
02/10/1976- ||special article||4364979||Chayanov, Kautsky, Lenin: Considerations towards a Synthesis||Two kinds of misconceptions and prejudice have come in the way of a sympathetic and correct understanding of A V Chayanov's work. First, that he was the theoretical fountainhead of a revived Naronnism, a eulogist of the petit-bourgeois producer who sought to provide a scientific facade for the viability of small-scale production units in agriculture. Secondly, there is the widespread notion that Chayanov's theory of a 'specific' peasant economy was proposed, more or less consciously, as an alternative to classical Marxist positions on the peasantry argued by Lenin and several other Marxists. While the first can be easily exposed for the crude simplification and propagandistic fantasy that it is, the later misconception is less easy to dispose of. This paper argues that not merely is there no conflict of a fundamental character between Chayanov's analysis of peasant production processes and the Marxist tradition, but that it is precisely Chayanov's theories that impart a logical and truly historical content to those assumptions of Marxist tradition which form the theoretical foundation of the work of Kautsky and Lenin. The early part of the paper presents Chayanov's theory, with certain modifications. This is followed by an analysis of data from India, cited not so much to prove any of the propositions advanced, but only to confirm them. The last part of the paper relates the whole argument back to Kautsky and Lenin and presents some considerations towards a synthesis of the ideas of Kautsky, Lenin and Chayanov.||Jairus Banaji

This result provides strong evidence in support of some of the hypotheses in the theories of neocolonialism and imperialism. It also provides an explanation for the phenomenon of continuous increase in the gap between rich and poor countries. It lends further support to the statement that "development and underdevelopment are two opposite poles of a dialectical unity".||Romesh Diwan,Kanta Marwah

17/1/1976- ||special articles||4364330||Indian Capitalist Class and the Public Sector, 1930-1947||The Indian capitalist class emerged with increased strength and large accumulations after the depression and the war, when the ties of the colonial economy with the metropolis were weakened. However, its position was still highly insecure. Past experience had taught the Indian capitalists that their gains would be short-lived if metropolitan control was fully reasserted. Even if political independence was achieved, it was feared that Indian capital was too weak to face foreign competition. The gains made by the capitalists during the depression and the war were not sufficient to initiate a process of industrialisation without planning and state help. Given these conditions, it was considered necessary to chalk out a plan of development with a vital role assigned to the state. Various plans were put forward, particularly in the 1940s, outlining the exact course Indian political economy was to follow. Thus almost a decade before independence, the economic system under which development was to take place after independence was chalked out in great detail, reflecting the foresight and maturity of the Indian bourgeoisie. This paper analyses the major ideas put forward during the period 1930-1947 on the rationale, nature and extent of planning and on the role the public sector was to play in economic development. The analysis focusses on the programmes put forward by the capitalist class and by the bodies backed by the Indian National Congress. An attempt is made to point out the impact of objective circumstances which tended to alternatively radicalise or tone down the stands of the various groups within the capitalist class and the Congress. Finally, the author examines briefly how the programmes came to be considered immediately after independence in the light of the preceding debate.||Aditya Mukherjee
10/1/1976- ||special articles||4364308||Structural Change in Agriculture and the Small Farm Sector||A comparison of the population data for 1961 and 1971 shows that in the rural work force the number of cultivators and 'other workers' has decreased, while that of agricultural labourers has increased significantly. This has prompted some scholars to conclude that the process of proletarianisation in the rural areas is growing apace. Are small farmers selling off (or leasing out) their land and are these lands bought (or leased in) by large and medium sized farmers? Are such transactions taking place on a scale that would possibly lead to a transformation of the holding pattern in agricultural land in a few years? Are the ranks of agricultural workers being swelled by the expropriated peasantry? This article tries to examine some of these questions in the context of the rural economy of Gujarat.||V. S. Vyas

The number of small cement plants, almost all of them located in rural areas, has increased from about 200 in 1965 to 2,800 in 1973. Total production from the small plant has during the same period increased from roughly 5 million tons to an estimated 20 million tons. So, the average size of the plants has decreased considerably - from about 25,500 tons per year in 1965 to 7,100 tons in 1973.||Jon Sigurdson

23/10/1976- ||special articles||4365040||The Inflationary Process: Some Theoretical Comments||It has been argued that the recent inflation in India cannot be explained only in terms of high levels of government spending in the face of inadequate levels of agricultural (especially foodgrains) production; that, in addition, prices have been pushed up owing to speculative stock-holding engendered by the upward revisions of the minimum support or procurement prices for foodgrains. Accelerating inflation has therefore gone hand in hand with addition to the level of stocks held for speculative reasons. It is argued in this paper that under certain conditions, which are fairly well descriptive of the Indian economy, any autonomous rise in the foodgrains price can result in a cumulative price rise even without any addition to the level of stocks. An initial price rise, which may be sustained by a momentary accumulation of stocks, will under these conditions give rise to a chain of expenditures and hence a chain of additional demands for foodgrains such that these additional demands together exceed the magnitude of stock accumulation and hence cause a cumulative price rise unchecked by the subsequent drawing down of the momentarily piled-up stocks.||Prabhat Patnaik,S.

Nevertheless, in almost 30 years since 1947 when the subject was first raised in the Central legislature, no progress has been made. More recently, an Expert Committee appointed to examine the question has reported that in the conditions obtaining in the country, it was not advisable to introduce crop insurance in the near future even on a pilot or an experimental basis. This is unfortunate. Crop insurance is too important for agricultural development, particularly in areas prone to drought and frequent crop failures, to be dismissed in this manner.||V. M. Dandekar

Over the same period, however, export earnings have grown rapidly. At first sight, therefore, the export sector appears to provide one of the few bright spots in an overallpicture of stagnation. So much so that the optimism arising from it has prompted several economists to advocate export-led growth as a strategy for development. In this context, it is often forgotten that the years since 1970 have witnessed certain new developments such as the recent boom in prices of primary commodities, the sharp rise in prices of crude oil and a marked acceleration in the rate of inflation in India. Clearly, all these occurrences have an important bearing on India's export performance in the past few years, and also need to be considered. This paper attempts to analyse export trends since 1970 and to discuss the broader implications of the recent developments for India's export sector. It is argued that the claims made by the advocates of export-led growth have little substance. As a first step, it would be useful to examine the overall trend in exports since 1970. In doing so, we shall outline the changes in the commodity composition as well as the changes in market distribution of exports. This is followed by a section which discusses the performance of each of the principal export industries and seeks to analyse the factors underlying the growth in export earnings. The final section of the paper attempts to place the export performance of the early 1970s in perspective, and considers the impact of the commodities boom, the oil crisis and the rapid inflation on the external sector of the Indian economy.||Deepak Nayyar

Self-reliance is not a new way of "bridging the gap" or "cathing up" in the sense of equalising GNP per capita or some similar measure. There are at least two good reasons why this would not be compatible with the idea of self-reliance: it means taking over the goal-structure of other societies which then become models to imitate; and it also means taking over the methods used by the rich industrialised Western countries, including centre-periphery formation within and between countries. The Third World does not become self-reliant by imitating the First and Second worlds, nor by exploiting some kind of Fourth World, Fourth World by exploiting the Fifth World (whatever that might be), etc. Self-reliance cannot be at the expense of the self-reliance of others; and it implies the autonomy to set one's own goals and realise them as far as possible through one's own efforts.||Johan Galtung

The rationale of this analysis is that in any acceptable model of demand for money one common variable is the gross national product or some other variant of it in real terms. Therefore, commercial bank credit and even other institutional credit to any sector or industry has to have some relationship with real output in that sector or industry. It is not the intention of this paper to propose that institutional credit to different sectors and industries ought to be based solely on their share in gross value of output. A number of other considerations have to be taken into account. Nevertheless, after making allowance for these, over a period of time the share of credit ought not to be disproportionately larger than the share in the value of output, with adjustments for cost increases beyond the control of the industry.||S.

1/2/1976- ||case studies||4364373||The Arms Trade and Society||Despite the world recession, one sector of western economies is booming - the arms manufacturing sector. In particular, there has been a dramatic increase in the export of arms to the Third World. The explosion in the arms trade raises a number of crucial questions about the role of force in the international system, about waste in the world economy, and about the nature of industrial development in both the Northern and Southern hemispheres. This article attempts to set out a framework for answering these questions by analysing the role of force in society. The basis of the analysis is the proposition that every type of mulitary technology is the product of a particular society, that the organisations, techniques and the forms taken by force is a microcosm or epitome of society in general.||Mary Kaldor

20/3/1976- ||special articles||4364469||American Policy Towards India: The Larger Framework||The state of general relations between any two countries is most fundamentally defined by their strategic relationship. The latter constitutes, as it were, the 'understructure', disciplining the 'superstructure' consisting of inter-state relations in the economic, cultural and political spheres. In the relations between a global power like the United States and a middle power like India, three strategic policies are open to the global power: containment, satellisation, and accommodation. The military containment of India initiated by the United States in the early 1950s flowed from the very logic of the encounter between a global power and a middle power. It was but a specific manifestation of a more general principle. In fact, it is fallacious to assume that there is no conflict of interests between India and the United States; that can happen only if the United States ceases to be a global power, or if India's power is shattered and its ambition to be a middle-power is abandoned. The tensions in Indo-US relations only reflect the basic strategic conflicts that are built into their respective positions in the international power hierarchy.||Baldev Raj Nayar

These tendencies have been accentuated since the 1950s. It has often been argued in the past that rising consuption levels in the developed consuming countries and boosting unit prices would contribute towards raising the revenues of producing countries. Although there is some truth in the statement, it needs rigorous qualification since the essential problem is not one of raising prices per se, but of restructuring the non-egalitarian socio-economic relationships inherent in the marketing and distribution chain.||Frederick F.

28/8/1976- ||special articles||4364891||Water Accounting in Irrigation Projects: A Technique from Maharashtra||Too much attention has been given to irrigation hardware in India, too little to the 'software'. There are good reasons for suspecting that large improvements in the performance of canal-irrigated agriculture are possible by means of (low-cost) changes in the administrative machinery, within the limits set by existing physical structures. More attention needs to be paid not only to better enforcement of crop zoning, but also to the more obvious and more neglected question of how to get better feedback to the canal operators about crops and locations, and encourage them to use that information to exert better control over water. Here the Maharashtra method of water accounting may have much to commend itself.||Robert Wade

Why should one bother with yet another paper on the subject? It is the purpose of this paper to show that the recent upsurge of critiques of the standard theory of comparative advantage (as expressed in the classical Ricardian forms and in the highly refined neo-classical form) have far-reaching consequences, not only theoretically, but in the implications of the theories for policy and action in the concrete world. This paper deals only with what might be termed the neo-Ricardian critiques of the theory of comparative advantage which have their main strength in providing a sharp critique of both the Ricardian and neo-classical views. It is not intended to suggest here that, as a consequence of the neo-Ricardian critique, all previous empirical and policy-oriented research hasbeen misleading. Rather the intention is to raise some new questions which urgently require answers. Much theoretical and empirical work remains to be done to develop a full-fledged neo-Ricardian view.||David Evans

29/5/1976- ||review of management, may 1976||4364665||Integrated Industrialisation of Non-Metropolitan Areas||In almost every developing country, there is already a planning process and machinery at work. Metropolitan areas have developed and exercise considerable, almost decisive, influence over policies, plans, programmes and allocation of scarce financial, foreign exchange, manpower and other measures. This paper argues that the developing countries should reorient their industralisation goals and priorities; give highest priority to the use of all the available labour; revise plan allocations in accordance with this objective; reassign available technical skills from the urban to the rural areas; and adopt a central-decentral type of authority with an effective system of support and communication from one to the other to ensure unity of purpose and synchronisation between both planning and implementation from above and below, and a greater use of iterative planning. Besides, overriding attention will have to be paid to the completion of land reforms, because the greatest hurdle in launching any extensive land-improvement or labour-using programmes is the owner ship status of land. A people-oriented development policy will also require fresh thinking on some of the prevalent notions and practices in regard to a number of vital policy and institutional issues such as investment criteria, protection, public sector, small-scale industry, capacity utilisation, import substitution, area development authority, distribution system, and co-operativisation of production.||L.

However, the prospects for 1976 appear to be better even though corporate investment in 1976 may not exceed the level attained in 1974. This study entailed an analysis of all the projects sanctioned by the all-India term lending institutions. Capital expenditures incurred on all projects sanctioned by these institutions during 1974 amounted to Rs 681 crores. But during 1975 these expenditures came down to Rs 487 crores, thus indicating a steep fall in corporate investment in 1975. As of now the capital expenditure during 1976 would be of the order of Rs 444 crores. If we add to this the expenditures that are likely to be incurred on projects to be approved during 1976 itself, one can hope that corporate investment will in 1976 at best reach the level attained in 1974.||C.

18/9/1976- ||special articles||4364942||Effective Cost of Primary Education in India||The measurement of educational costs is an intricate problem. Since costs are met not only by public agencies, but by private institutions and even households, calculations of costs made solely on the basis of government expenditure will not yield reliable results. There are also drop out and stagnation factors that affect the 'effective cost' per unit of output. In this paper, an attempt is made to estimate the rates of drop out and stagnation in various Indian states at the elementary stage of education. On the basis of these calculations, a physical index of 'effective cost' is constructed which, it is hoped, is capable of capturing the total cost of schooling per unit of output to society. An analysis of the physical index of 'effective cost' reveals that the effective costs of primary education are lowest in Kerala, and the states in the north-western parts of the country. Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Nagaland, Manipur, Karnataka, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh are among the states with the highest costs of education per functionally literate person.||P. R. Gopinathan Nair

24/7/1976- ||special articles||4364818||Population and Development||In the past 20 years or so, rapid growth of population in the third world countries has become a matter of increasing concern for social scientists at home and abroad. Most, if not all, of them consider the present trend in population increase to be a dreadful menace to the future development of the third world. They argue that the rapidly rising population eats up the few fruits of development, and consequently minimises the saving and investment potential of the already 'overpopulated' third world. The aim of this paper, is to consider the relevance of some of the major propositions concerning the relationship between population and development in the third world. Towards this end, the author outlines in brief the main demographic theories and points out some of the crucial flaws in the basic premise of the neo-Malthusian theory.||Jaganath Pathy

08/5/1976- ||special articles||4364603||Housing the Poor in Ahmedabad||A concomitant of the comparatively rapid urbanisation of Gujarat has been the continuous growth of the slums in cities like Ahmedabad, Baroda, Surat, Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Jamnagar. In any programme of war on poverty, along with provision of food and education, provision of adequate housing assumes great importance. In such a programme, we have to begin where the need for housing is most intensely felt. The need for providing minimum housing facilities is most urgent in the case of urban slum dwellers. The outstanding physical characteristic of Ahmedabad city is the sharp contrast between the city's housing for the rich and that for the poor. The city, which claims to be the centre of the cultural life of Gujarat, has subjugated huge numbers of people to the lowest from of urban life. We have restricted our study to two types of slums in which conditions are the worst. We deal, first, with the housing and socio-economic conditions of the hutment dwellers which consist of the economically weakest section of the urban population. In the later part of the article, we try to analyse the socio-economic and housing conditions of the chawl dwellers.||Mahesh Bhatt,V. K. Chawda

Since the field of foreign investment is heavily dominated by MNCs, a realistic explanation of one necessarily serves in great part as an explanation of the other. An attempt is made, wherever possible, to draw a distinction between "multinationals" proper, defined as the very large direct investors which have subsidiaries in several countries, and "other" foreign investors, smaller and less widespread. There is now an immense literature on the causes of foreign investment, especially by MNCs, and a review of this sort must necessarily be selective. This paper concentrates primarily on the economic and managerial aspects (conventionally defined) of the subject, though it also touches upon some wider socio-political implications, and tries to draw out those features which have special relevance to developing countries. The treatment is completely non-mathematical; and no attempt is made in this paper to discuss the effects of MNCs on host countries.||Sanjaya Lall

The reasons for this are of a very varied nature, including undoubtedly the fear that has been instilled into certain categories of traders by the measures taken after the Emergency. Factors other than those introduced by the Emergency appear to have been, however, by far the more important for the downward trend in prices in evidence over the last year. Moreover, some of the measures taken for the purpose carry with them serious implications for the future, particularly when judged in relation to the enormous and growing problem of unemployment.||K.

26/6/1976- ||review of agriculture, june 1976||4364737||Agricultural Growth, Real Wages, and the Rural Poor in India||A number of authors have asserted that the green revolution, despite its marked output-increasing effects, has not benefited the rural poor. This is taken as evidence of the incompatibility between redressal of rural poverty and agricultural growth within the existing institutional framework. The implication is that, without fundamental institutional reform, alleviation of rural poverty is infeasible. This paper uses data recently made available from the 25th round of the National Sample Survey (NSS) for 1970-71 to cast some doubt on the factual basis of this view. Part I of the paper examines the trends in real wage rates of agricultural labourers as delineated in past studies in the light of the more recent evidence. It also provides data which suggest that the conclusions about the effects of the green revolution on rural poverty have been based on time series data which end at a date before the high-yielding varieties had been widely adopted in the heartland of the green revolution - the wheat-growing areas of the Punjab. The author also examines the explanations provided for the seeming paradox that despite the presumed increase in the demand for labour which can normally be expected to accompany agricultural growth, real wages have not risen. In this context, he considers the extent to which inter-state variations in changes in wages can be explained in conventional demand and supply terms. Part II of the paper examines to what extent the conclusions derived from the poverty 'numbers game' are validated by the recent NSS evidence, and also derives measures other than the usual poverty statistic, for the social welfare effects of the household consumption changes during the period 1956-57 to 1970-71 among the 'weaker sections' of rural India.||Deepak Lal

Apart from their size and the financial power that accompanies it, links between the large corporations and the political power structure are much closer in the US than in most other countries, with the possible exception of Japan. A study of the behavioural patterns of US multinational corporations is, therefore, important. This article relies largely on a report of the US Tariff Commission.

If these proposals are finally incorporated in the Constitution, we shall have a far more powerful Parliament which, in a parliamentary system such as ours, inevitably means a far more powerful executive at the Centre, than what we have so far had in normal times. While the view of the ruling party that, once it gets its mandate from the electorate, it should be able to function unfettered by any judicial or other limitations is understandable, we must constantly remind ourselves that ours is a federal and democratic polity. The supremacy of Parliament in such a polity is limited not only by the powers allotted to the states but also by the accepted norms of democracy as enshrined in the Constitution.||S. V. Kogekar

Little-Mirrlees do not concern themselves with (1) and start out at the stage when the estimates of all inputs and outputs have been made. They do deal with (3) but have nothing significant to say. The focus of the Little-Mirrlees manual is on the valuation problem. In analysing this problem the authors have introduced significant departures. These are related to (1) valuation of commodities, (2) valuation of incomes, (3) valuation of employment, and (4) valuation of factors.||A. Qayum

12/6/1976- ||special articles||4364704||Economic Genocide in Chile: Open Letter to Milton Friedman and Arnold Harberger||This is a critique, written in the form of an open letter, of the economic policies of the military Junta in Chile. The Junta's economic programme consists of freeing almost all prices to raise them several-fold to 'world levels' and increasing the money supply concomitantly. A 'free' capital market is fostered as well, which beyond concentrating capital into conglomerates also creates its own financial instruments above and beyond the control and even the accounting of the state, and which at the same time increases the amount of monetary means of payment and their velocity of circulation. Both of these 'freedoms' generate a runaway inflation whose consequences, and intended effects, are to shift income and wealth from labour to capital and from smaller to bigger capital. Fortifying the same process to the same effect still further, 'freedom' must be promoted by destroying or yellow-dog-co-opting the organisation of labour and eliminating its bargaining power, and through all means preventing money wages from keeping pace with inflation in both private and public employment. In short, real wages are drastically reduced by bringing prices but not wages to 'world' levels. At the same time, the state divests itself of state sector enterprises at bargain basement prices to Chilean and particularly to foreign big capital, doing so not only with enterprises that became state-owned or controlled under the Allende government, but also with enterprises that had been financed through state investment for over a generation. Similarly, a crash programme of agrarian counter-reform is instituted and some 2 million hectares of land expropriated during the Allende and Frei administrations is returned to their former owners and/or to new capitalist owners, while repressing and exploiting the peasantry and rural labourers even more brutally than the urban population. Not only wages but also employment and expenditures in the public sector are cut back and much of the most advanced social security and public health system of Latin America (outside of Cuba) is turned into a private pay-as-you-go business. In the 'external' sector, there is repeated devaluation, tariffs and other import restrictions are relaxed and every kind of favour is extended to foreign capital, including payments to the American copper companies in excess of the values of their former properties. The balance of payments is redressed by reducing imports of goods necessary to meet the essential consumption needs of the population, while exporting manufactures and even food products that the consumer's reduced purchasing power no longer permits them to buy. Production is restructured and investment is redirected to permit the still greater promotion of 'non-traditional' exports of food, raw materials and manufactures at the expense of the Chilean consumers, whose most essential needs are sacrificed more and more by an intentional, calculated and forcibly imposed policy of economic genocide.||Andre Gunder Frank

Not only that, several new clauses which did not figure in the Committee's proposals have been introduced in the Amendment Bill for which no justification of any kind has been given. The government's aim in all this seems to be to go much beyond the Committee's proposals and tilt the balance of authority in favour of the Union Executive.

23/10/1976- ||special articles||4365041||Forty-Fourth Constitutional Amendment||The Constitution (Forty-Fourth Amendment) Bill, 1976, is due to be debated in Parliament. The present paper considers the proposed changes and their implications. While a Constitution must change with the times, any amendment to a Constitution must remain exactly that - an amendment - and not go beyond and affect the basic structure of the Constitution. The Courts must continue to have the power of reviewing constitutional amendments with a view to ensuring that they remain amendments and no more than that. The proposed Article 31-C, which seeks to do away with important fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14, 19 and 31, is neither desirable nor necessary. While anti-national activities and associations must be banned, provisions under the existing law are adequate for the purpose; hence, the proposed Article 31-D is not necessary. The proposal to vest the authority for deciding the constitutional validity of Central laws in the Supreme Court, and the proposal to set up administrative tribunals over which the High Courts are not to have any jurisdiction, have grave implications and may need to be reconsidered. The charter of Fundamental Duties is welcome, though it is not clear if such enumeration of fundamental duties is the best way of helping their assimilation in social values and behaviour.||S. P.

1/8/1976- ||ideological issues||4364826||Population Policy and Redistribution of Income||Given the present level and pattern of distribution of income and the occupational stracture of the economy, there may not be sufficient economic motivation for families below a certain consumption level to limit their size to the extent necessary for bringing about the desired reduction in the overall fertility levels. A congruence of economic motivation at the national level and at the family level is, therefore, necessary. How does the need for bringing about such a congruence affect national policy? First, it is not sufficient for the economy to grow at a faster rate. Rather, a significant impact on fertility can be made only if a more equitable distribution of income is achieved. Second, a shift towards an appropriate technology is needed. As the level of income increases, a shift to less labour-intensive technology will be necessary so that families find a sufficient economic rationale to limit their size. A population policy for achieving the long-term objectives, therefore, should also be directed towards redistribution of income and proper technological choices.||C. Rangarajan,J. K. Satia

Most were duly impressed by the fossils of Lan-t'ien Man (600,000 BC), the fabulous jade funerary suits of Prince Liu Sheng and Princess Tou Wan, and the beautiful bronze "Flying Horse." Few Americans who viewed the exhibition were aware of the political nature of Chinese archaeology. In China archaeology is "political"; a revolutionary enterprise. This discussion deals with the increased politicalisation of archaeology during The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the present ideological role assigned to Chinese archaeology by China's revolutionary government. The major conclusions reached are that archaeology in China is enjoined to contribute to the development of a "peoples' history". Emphasis is to be placed on past contributions of the masses and their exploitation by the imperial elites. Archaeology is to provide data for "popular education in ideology politics and class struggle".||Robert J. Fornaro

27/11/1976- ||special article||4365139||A Dualistic Labour System? A Critique of the 'Informal Sector' Concept: I: The Informal Sector||This paper examines the utility of the concept of the 'informal sector'. The author argues, partly on the basis of research into labour relations in a small town in western India, that the concept of the informal sector is analytically inadequate. The informal sector, he suggests, cannot be demarcated as a separate economic compartment and/or labour situation. In Part I of the article it is argued that any attempt to demarcate the informal sector will give rise to numerous inconsistencies and difficulties. Moreover, by interpreting the relationship of the informal sector to the formal sector in a dualistic framework and by focusing on the mutually exclusive characteristics, we lose sight of the unity and totality of the productive system. In Part II of the article, the author suggests that rather than divide the urban system into two segments, it is preferable to emphasise the fragmented nature of the entire labour market. Finally, in Part III, the author considers the social classes which are usually associated with the urban labour force. [Part I of the article appears this week. Parts II and III will be published in the following weeks.]||Jan Breman

Whatever the particular and interactive implications of these problems, it has been into such a context that many international relief and development agencies moved. Some of these functioned well; others poorly. Our attempt in this paper is a simple, descriptive analysis of how one particular famine relief programme and its related development programme fared, in one Bangladesh setting. We seek to identify the factors that favoured successful outcomes where these occurred, and those that prevented further possibilities.||Cole Patrick Dodge,Paul D. Wiebe

09/10/1976- ||special articles||4364997||Apartheid Ideology and Capitalist Growth in South Africa||The appropriation of Black slave labour was the principal material basis for the existence and prosperity of Dutch farmers - the Boers - whose colonisation of parts of southern Africa began in 1652. This material basis was partially destroyed by the first of the thrusts of capitalism in South Africa, the abolition of slavery of 1834. With the growth of capitalism, and the discovery of gold and diamonds, British imperialism made yet another attack on the material basis of the Boers in the shape of the Anglo-Boer war of 1899. The pre-capitalist material basis for Boer ideology which was impeding the growth of capitalism had to be destroyed; slave labour had to be set free to be brought under wage labour. But despite these setbacks, Boer ideology itself was not completely destroyed; the racist idea, the core-foundation of Boer ideology, was adopted and institutionalised by capitalism under the name of apartheid. However, in the severe restraints and controls over a 'free' employment of available labour force implicit in the practice of apartheid, one finds the basic contradiction between the unrestrained growth of capitalism and apartheid in practice. Apartheid has thus to be forced, by the sheer logic of history, to shed its more blatant aspects and come to terms with the designs of imperialism for South Africa. The rising tide of national liberation movements in southern Africa has made the need for presenting an acceptable face of apartheid more urgent.||L. J. M. Sakarai

Any discussion has to identify the characteristics of the international market for technology. What are the product characteristics of technology, viewed as a commodity being traded in? Who transfer (or trade in) technology? What are the motivating forces behind transfer of technology to developing countries? The international market for technology remains highly imperfect, its structure being characterised by a large number of weak buyers and the dominance of a few sellers. Such a trade relation is, therefore, better explained in terms of the theory of 'unequal exchange' rather than that of comparative advantage.||K. K. Subrahmanian,P. Mohanan Pillai

This is mainly due to social, cultural and individual personality factors, which are complex variables not easily understandable like technological or physical resources. In developing countries like India, where Western management institutions, practices and education have been imported in a wholesale fashion, the problems of maximising managerial effectiveness get doubly compounded. In this paper, we propose to examine the nature of managerial effectiveness in the Indian environment and develop an action plan for its improvement.||R. S. Ganapathy,T. V. G. Krishnamurthy,R. V.

For this reason alone, as well as likely increases in female participation rates, there is a growing female labour force and a need for accelerated recruitment of women to urban employment. Arguments against reserving jobs for men include the increasing burden of urban overhead expenditure if only males are economically active, raising urban family living standards and the encouragement of lower fertility, if women get some of the jobs. Promotion of employment opportunities for women in the organised sector, as yet very low, should be part of a package of policies to absorb labour more remuneratively in rural areas and enhance the status of the urban unorganised sector, more of whose workers are already women.||Heather Joshi
03/7/1976- ||special articles||4364760||Price of Rural Credit: An Empirical Analysis of Kerala||This article, based on a pilot survey in Trivandrum taluk, seeks to bring out certain less known but crucial aspects of the rural credit market in Kerala. Non-institutional agencies account for an overwhelming proportion of the credit supply in Kerala. The average rate of interest is much higher than the average indicated by the Reserve Bank's All India Debt and Investment Survey. The bulk of the institutional credit is appropriated by a relatively small proportion of households belonging to the upper stratum of families. The cost of credit it thus inversely related to the economic status of the borrower. The distinction between professional and non-professional moneylenders is irrelevant in practice; they both cater to the same clientele, take identical types of securities and charge the same high rates of interest. The results of the author's pilot survey also show that the actual interest on a good proportion of loan transactions is concealed.||T. V. Narayana Kurup

For understanding the causes of these variations across states and of the deceleration of growth rate of agricultural production at the all-India level in the period since 1964/65, an understanding of the determinants of private investment is essential. This paper is confined to (i) analysing the extent to which the variations in the growth rate of irrigation explain the variations in the growth rate of agricultural production across the states, and (ii) showing that private investment played a significant role in bringing about the increases in area under irrigation.||Sitaram Yechuri

The sources for this study are derived from a limited number of historical documents and from anthropological field research in the town of Jagadhri, located some 125 miles northwest of Delhi. The 19th Century is significant for it marks the transformation of the society from one based on the ceremony of the chiefs and rulers to the social dominance of the merchants and agriculturists. This period also reflects, it seems, a change from society as seen as a narrative about the past, in which the ceremonial bonds between communities were stressed, to the descriptive accounts of more contemporary persons and events in which the social structural characteristics of the merchants and agriculturists began to gain an increasing importance.||Leighton Hazlehurst

It is a science of great relevance to equipment designers and managers, and has many applications in industry and society. Understanding the principles of ergonomics can greatly assist in implementing the 'first-time-right' approach in systems design. In view of our large population, high unemployment and abundance of material resources, the principles of ergonomics can be successfully used in selecting technology appropriate for our conditions.||S.

In this paper, an attempt is made to analyse the results of a recently published Report of the Rural Labour Enquiry. The Enquiry, which was conducted in 1964-65, gives state-wise breakdown on employment and unemployment among men and women agricultural labourers. Divergent though the female unemployment is among states, it is difficult to pin-point any factors leading to this situation. All that one can say is that female unemployment tends to be high in states where male unemployment is also high. What causes either, or both together, remains an open question.||Leela Gulati

1/8/1976- ||role of health services||4364832||Health, Medicine and Underdevelopment||A growing volume of literature exists on the appalling state of health of the populations of most underdeveloped nations. However, such material is almost entirely descriptive, with little attempt at conceptual analysis, particularly of a critical kind. Thus health planners continue to abstract the problems of death and disease from their socio-economic context, and to transmute them into technical problems amenable to purely technical solutions. One of the factors which allows this approach to the health problems of the third world to predominate has been the failure of Marxists to incorporate the implications of health and disease into their analysis. In this article an attempt is made to show some of the reasons why questions concerning the material condition of third world populations, and their physical reproduction, can and should be taken into account in making sense of the real nature of contemporary underdevelopment.||Lesley Doyal,Imogen Pennell

This article argues that an analysis based on the money-multiplier theory is unsatisfactory theoretically and of little use in practice, say for framing the monetary budget. Whereas the money-multiplier approach provides a mechanistic explanation of variations in money supply, the Reserve Bank's analysis provides an economic explanation.||N. A. Mujumdar

However, for formulating tax policies and other redistributive measures, such aggregative measures of inequality of asset distribution do not help. What is needed is information about the distribution of assets among the top asset-holders. Using the summary results of the first schedule of the Reserve Bank's All-India Debt and Investment Survey (1971-72), this paper attempts to identify the problems involved in investigating the relative inequalities in asset-holding among the states and within the group of rural households who may be described as "property owners".||Sreelekha Basu

It was the reduction in infant mortality, due partly to the shift in the age of marriage but largely to improvement in medical and public health facilities, which improved the child survival rate and this in turn seems to have influenced the number of children a woman wanted to have. What Kerala really shows to the rest of India is the need to combine all these factors and, of course, female education. It also cautions us against relying only on raising the age of marriage to reduce the rate of growth of population because, going by Kerala's experience, higher age of marriage alone might well lead to higher rates of growth of population, at least in the immediate future.||Leela Gulati

A Critique of the 'Informal Sector' Concept: III: Labour Force and Class Formation||This paper examines the utility of the concept of the 'informal sector'. The author argues, partly on the basis of research into labour relations in a small town in western India, that the concept of the informal sector is analytically inadequate. The informal sector, he suggests, cannot be demarcated as a separate economic compartment and/or labour situation. In Part I of the article it is argued that any attempt to demarcate the informal sector will give rise to numerous inconsistencies and difficulties. Moreover, by interpreting the relationship of the informal sector to the formal sector in a dualistic framework and by focussing on the mutually exclusive characteristics, we lose sight of the unity and totality of the productive system. In Part II of the article, the author suggests that rather than divide the urban system into two segments, it is preferable to emphasise the fragmented nature of the entire labour market. Finally, in Part III, the author considers the social classes which are usually associated with the urban labour force. [This is the third and final part of the article. Part I and II were published on November 27 and December 4 respectively.]||Jan Breman

This is done with a view to testing empirically some major populist formulations. Part I of this article briefly evaluates populist economic policy formulations for the development of agriculture in general. Part II highlights the major theoretical formulations on which the above policy formulations rest. Part III considers data from some villages in Tamil Nadu in the light of the above theoretical formulations. Finally, Part IV evaluates the correctness of populist formulations in the empirical context provided by the villages studied.||S. S. Sivakumar

To pose the problem in terms of an absolute fall of the profit rate in the traditional manufacturing centres forcing capital to relocate part of its production would be quite inadequate. The question to be answered (which is, in fact, answered by the movement of capital) is whether production at the traditional sites of production or production at new sites provides for better expansion and accumulation of capital under "given" conditions. As yet, it is hardly possible to estimate the extent of the displacement of manufacturing resulting from the trend towards worldwide industrial relocation. There is evidence, however, that in some places in the world a significant part of the labour force which belonged to the industrial reserve army only a few years ago has been converted into an active labour army in the meantime. There are indications that not only the border regions of Western Europe, not only Middle America, North Africa, South Africa and Southeast Asia, but increasingly so Eastern Europe, South America, Central Africa and South Asia are providing sites for relocated manufacturing.||Folker Frobel,Jurgen Heinrichs,Otto Kreye

First, the topic of smuggling of rice and jute from Bangladesh to India will be raised with astonishing frequency; and second, the "estimates" (or rather guesses) which are presented as to the scale of these operations vary enormously, from unimportant figures to well over a million tons per year. This paper deals first with evidence about the scale on which rice is smuggled out, and then, in part II, turns its attention to jute. Various independent approaches to estimating the scale of smuggling are considered.||W. B. Reddaway,Md Mizanur Rahman

The original demands of the women were confined to the banning of rice exports, but later their demands also included changes in the Darbar and the administrative set-up. The importance of the Nupi Lan lies in the fact that it prepared the ground for the leading role played by the women of Manipur in the emergence of a new Manipur after the end of the Second War.||Sanamani Yambem
27/3/1976- ||special articles||4364494||Migration of Doctors from India||The major causes of medical emigration from India are to be found in the 'medical dependency' that distorts India's medical policies and provisions to suit the interests of consumers of health services in the developed countries (notably Britain and the Untied States) and in India (where such consumers are the urban middle classes). This paper, however, deals only peripherally with this underlying structure. It concentrates instead on the changes in size and direction of medical emigration from India. In the short term, these are largely affected by the employment prospects for medical graduates. After a brief consideration of some general features, the paper deals with the supply of doctors, the employment opportunities for doctors and the demand for doctors' services. It then considers the recent history of medical emigration, and the prospects forthe immediate future. The major conclusion of the paper is that there will be increasing tendency for emigration among Indian doctors - as employment opportunities deteriorate rapidly over the next few years. There is little sign, too, that government policy will radically change - except in response to changing circumstances in the countries which receive Indian doctors (such as with the expansion in the output of doctors in Britain and North America, and the reorientation of Britain towards the EEC).||Roger Jeffery

As such it had the support of the Indian bourgeoisie as well as the masses. The boycott programme did not mean the same thing to all men - to the merchant, the petty trader, the cotton mill-owner, the Indian consumer. But overriding the short-term pros and cons - the on-the-one-hand/on-the-other-hand balancing of the bourgeois mentality - was the long-term prespective of an anti-imperialist struggle. Despite the stresses and strains between sections of the Indian capitalist class and the national leadership and its mass following, the struggle against foreign capitalist domination and imperialist exploitation remained the determining factor.||S.

The paper attempts to examine the differential impact of the green revolution on small and large farms in Punjab. The effect of the green revolution in the relative position of small and big farmers is examined in respect of their participation in technical change, productivity increases, income gains etc. The ultimate purpose of the study is to throw some light on the basic question of the long-run viability of the small farm sector. The reference period of the study is the agricultural year 1972-73.||Pranab Bhattacharya,Abdul Majid, Jr.

Why do small farmers hire labour? Especially, why do small farmers who themselves sell their labour power purchase labour power from other poor peasants?||Ashok Rudra,Madan Mohan Mukhopadhya

Moreover, even in this very diluted policy, there appears to be some selective emphasis in implementation. For instance, the coercive elements appear to be put into operation much more effectively than such elements as enlarging the education system for girls, strengthening the existing nutrition programme for pre-school children and creating mass mobilisation to ensure higher age at marriage for boys and girls. Unfortunately, again, there is little evidence that anything new and refreshing is being thought of to make the existing health services more meaningful to the people of the country, particularly to people living in the rural areas. If this trend continues, the National Population Policy will turn out to be yet another episode in the unfortunate saga of the efforts of the leadership of the country to bring about control of population growth without bringing about concurrent improvements in the levels of living of the masses, particularly those of the weaker sections of society.||D.

17/4/1976- ||special articles||4364549||Loose Ends in the Budget||The budget for 1976-77 seeks to step the Plan provision from 32.3 per cent of the centre's aggregate disbursements as in 1975-76 (revised estimates) to 36.7 per cent. This presumes a tight reining in of non-Plan expenditure which may not be actually achieved. The allocations for defence, general services and non-Plan loans to states, to mention only three heads, appear to be insufficient and, therefore, are likely to be exceeded. If Plan outlay is nevertheless retained intact, the result may be a much larger deficit than envisaged in the budget. As it is the real deficit in 1976-77 is of the order of Rs 900 crores and not Rs 320 as indicated in the budget. This is made up of the disclosed deficit of Rs 320 crores, the proposed withdrawal from compulsory deposits of Rs 480 crores and use of Rs 100 crores from the special deposit of non-government provident funds. A deficit of this order in a year when there will be repayment of Rs 270 crores of compulsory deposits made in the past and substantial additions to disposable income as a result of the tax concessions announced in the 1976-77 budget cannot but strengthen demand pressures and pose a threat to price stability. The budget for 1976-77 also suggests increasing dependence on resources from abroad. The budget expects to finance 9 per cent of the total outlay through foreign savings. What is more, a sizeable portion of foreign assistance is being secured on hard terms and used for meeting repayment obligations.||M. R. Nair
