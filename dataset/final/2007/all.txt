In tackling "encroachment" and "vagrancy", both of which are seen to undermine state visions of modernity, there has also been an increase in municipal action against leprosy deformed people making a living from begging on the streets, without addressing their need to make a living. These moves have weakened the capacity of leprosy-affected people to mobilise themselves as a distinctive discriminated-against group, while implying that their difficulties are located foremost in a biological condition, rather than in negative social interpretations of that condition. This paper aims to highlight the ways in which policies, ostensibly designed to improve the lot of leprosy-affected people, simultaneously perpetuate prejudices against them.||James Staples

Participatory involvement of citizens in and accountability of local self-governance structures are almost totally absent in urban areas. The author discusses the work of a non-governmental organisation in which he is actively involved in attempting to create informal structures that seek to redress this shortcoming and offers a charter for more formally recognised structures that could be organised on a wider scale to give the urban dweller a voice.||Ramesh Ramanathan

3/11/2007-9/11/2007||special articles||40276752||The Use and Abuse of Democracy in West Bengal||This article examines the left's engagement with democracy in West Bengal. Before 1967, the left built a deliberative democratic tradition in Bengal. The United Front governments and the Naxalite movement led to a radicalisation of politics, which was followed by a fratricidal conflict culminating in a counter attack on the entire left by the state. This defeat paved the way for a historic compromise of the parliamentary left. In 1977 this defeated left came to power, but it was a veritable political revolution as a middle class-led intermediate regime came to acquire social and political power. The central claim to legitimacy of this new regime was its contention of representing the people. Hence, disciplining them as well as securing their consent through the organisation and ideology of the communist party is central to their continuation in power. This new ruling class lives off the social surplus creating a fiscal crisis for the state. To get out of this crisis it ultimately has to surrender to capital, shift to a neoliberal growth model and increasingly attack democracy.||Sanjeeb Mukherjee

Far from disappearing as the economy modernises, discrimination remains a problem which, for reasons outlined here, is not amenable to self correction, but rather requires interventionist policies to remedy||Sukhadeo Thorat,Katherine S.

Added to this are the ingenious methods of extra-budgetary and off-budgetary resource collection by local authorities, and passing down of welfare functions to lower levels of administration. However, all these have resulted in high levels of inter-city and intra-city inequalities.||Darshini Mahadevia

However, returns on these public investments, reckoned in terms of poverty reduction, vary drastically across different types of investment. The trade-off between agricultural growth and poverty reduction is generally small among different types of investments and between regions. Agricultural research, education, and infrastructure development have a significant growth impact as well as a large poverty reduction impact.||Sukhadeo Thorat,Shenggen Fan

This paper brings out the core elements of the reform - the need to define "public purpose" ex ante for compulsory acquisition of land, the measures that would allow the market price of land to play its correct role, and the approach to valuation. It also argues for an independent valuer when compulsory taking is involved and methods of valuation to ensure that the landowner, including the farmer, gets the correct value for his land in both compulsory acquisition and in voluntary sale. There is a need for a parallel non-compulsory framework for acquisition and for developing key elements of the same.||Sebastian Morris,Ajay Pandey

With a skewed market participation that largely favours speculators, the futures market leaves a lot to be desired as an effective instrument of risk management and price discovery for the benefit of the growers, traders, processors, and other stakeholders in the physical trade. Policymakers have overlooked wider considerations involving the discipline of checks and balances. Owing to the massive size and non-zero-sum game character of these markets, they are likely to introduce a series of unsettling macroeconomic effects, such as a possible redistribution of incomes from the small players to the big speculative financial market entities. The article concludes with a reference to the factors that could have been behind the snags afflicting the present commodities futures policy, and suggests how the needs of the real economy can be satisfied by strengthening the forward trade that is firmly anchored in the physical trade of the farm commodities under reference.||Kamal Nayan Kabra

The paper finds that user charges do not adequately cover the production costs of supplying water or expenditure on sewerage. The bottlenecks to reforming public service delivery are financial and institutional, as they pertain to existing arrangements for water and sewerage. Possible reform actions to improve service delivery are changes in institutional arrangements for delivery, privatisation, and citizen participation.||Kala Seetharam Sridhar
10/2/2007-16/2/2007||special articles||4419235||Recent Trends in Poverty and Inequality: Some Preliminary Results||Preliminary estimates from the published reports of the 61st round of the National Sample Survey suggest that while poverty did reduce during 1993-2005, the annual rate of reduction in this period was lower than in the 1970s and 1980s. More importantly, the bulk of this decline occurred in 1999-2005, with little or no reduction in poverty in 1993-2000, confirming the earlier consensus that the 1990s were indeed the lost decade for poverty reduction. Although the analysis is not conclusive, the fall in the relative price of food and the regional pattern of changes in employment and wages appear to underlie these trends. These results need to be explored in greater detail as and when the unit level data for 2004-05 become available. The paper also flags certain issues related to the poverty line which need to be settled once and for all.||Himanshu

In contrast to the pre-reform period (1950-90), the actual growth of exports in the post-reform period has been above the potential offered by the growth of world demand. The gap between the actual and potential is mainly explained by an improvement in the overall competitiveness of India's exports. The rapid growth of India's merchandise exports since 2002 gives no room for complacency since it has been mainly determined by a buoyant world economy. The competitiveness effect, though positive, has not been the major contributing factor to the acceleration in the growth rate of merchandise exports in recent years. It appears that exports have been adversely affected by the appreciation of the real effective exchange rate during the post-reform period.||C. Veeramani

While there exist valuable early appraisals of the period, access to new data and fresh Information allows for a longer and more comparative view of the outcome. We find overwhelming evidence not onlyof resurgent growth, but also of a lasting transformation of a stagnant colonial enclave into an economy capable of sustained growth. It is useful to recognise the economic policy of this period as distinct, not only from what preceded it but also from what came after, for it facilitates an understanding of the political conditions needed for economic interventions that are growth inducing. The paper also addresses some lingering perceptions of policy of the time, notably its impact on agriculture and the govemance of the public enterprises.||Pulapre Balakrishnan

This paper reports the findings from a survey in a rural district in Uttar Pradesh. Rural households, parents, teachers and VEC members were surveyed on the status of education services and the extent of community participation in the public delivery of education services. Most parents do not know that a VEC exists, public participation in improving education is negligible, and large numbers of children in the villages have not acquired basic competencies of reading, writing, and arithmetic. Based on the findings of the baseline survey, this paper also describes a set of information and advocacy campaigns that have been designed to explore whether local participation can increase, and future research plans to evaluate the impact of these interventions.||Abhijit Banerjee,Rukmini Banerji,Esther Duflo,Rachel Glennerster,Daniel Kenniston,Stuti Khemani,Marc Shotland

Using data from secondary sources and a vehicular survey, estimates of annual air pollution abatement cost for vehicles complying with Euro norms are made for the road transport sector in Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. The pollution abatement cost of each vehicle comprises the cost of upgrading vehicular technology and cost of improving fuel quality. For example, the annual pollution abatement cost for a passenger car complying with Euro III norms is estimated at Rs 7,190 and Rs 6,624 for AP and HP, respectively. If all vehicles comply with Euro III norms, total air pollution abatement cost of the road transport sector constitutes 2.13 per cent and2.16per cent of state domestic product of the respective states.||Sushmita Chatterjee,Kishore K.

The results confirm widening interstate disparities in income in the first quinquennium of the 21st century, a continuation of the trend of the 1990s. Urban employment occurs strongly in initially urbanised states. All states are found to be diversifying, but at a slower pace in low income states.

One sees the moneylender as a resilient entity calling for his future involvement in the process of rural development, and the other sees him as an exploiter to be slowly weeded out. To get a more nuanced account of his role, a diary kept by a moneylender operating in a village in the Anantapur district of Andhra Pradesh is analysed here. Even a cursory reading of this diary gives rich details on the scale and importance of the transactions carried out by the moneylender. Through this diary, formal lending agencies, be they banks or microfinance institutions, which have plans to supplant the moneylender will gain rich insights into the role played by this ubiquitous entity.||S.

Using the case of Tamil Nadu that experienced an unprecedented fiscal deterioration–a part of the widespread fiscal stress in Indian states in the late 1990s-the analysis attempts to take into account uncertainty and discusses the key components of the state's fiscal accounts and how they respond to reforms and shocks. It illustrates that risks to the state's fiscal outlook include interest rate shocks, pressures on the primary balance, and contingent liabilities, reflecting the interplay of subnational and national policies. The analysis is relevant for other Indian states and countries.||Elena Ianchovichina,Lili Liu,Mohan Nagarajan

This paper discusses these areas and also the experience of a couple of advanced economies. It suggests a set of reforms which will reverse the policy coarctation for agricultural credit. It argues that the successful promotion of the deepening of rural financial markets, which would ensure uninterrupted flow of credit to agriculture will require systematic rather than isolated efforts, with related actions being undertaken on several fronts.||P.

The noteworthy feature of the methodology is that it allows the data to parametrise the model, thus yielding results that are immune to the prior beliefs of the researcher. The resulting estimates reveal that there are two growth regimes in India since 1950. The authors then decompose by sector the contribution to the change in the growth rate across these regimes. Finally, by means of a simple econometric model, they test a hypothesis that emerges from their estimation and testing for structural break in the main sectors of the economy to provide an explanation of the growth transition in India. In passing, the authors consider the bearing of their results on extant explanations of the same transition.||Pulapre Balakrishnan,M. Parameswaran

A considerably unequal distribution in investment-deposit ratios creates scope for varied forms of arbitraging.

These developments point to the substantially changed market structure, wherein arbitraging operations between markets, which are generally believed to remove misalignment of rates, have instead increased disparities.||EPW Research Foundation

This is especially so over remembering an event such as 1857, on which Indians continue to have very differing opinions. This paper argues that concerns over the film, as with 1857 itself, speak of an unresolved question of Indian democracy, i e, whether the two domains of Indian democracy, comprising the "elite" and the "subaltern", can ever combine to produce a "politics of the people". Such a politics would give Indian democracy both a working sense of sovereignty and a lively sense of being truly a democracy.||Rochona Majumdar,Dipesh Chakrabarty

The findings reveal that though the law lacked adequate penal clauses, it still contributed towards increasing the age at marriage. It worked because a cultural shift towards later marriages was already taking place; the law worked by reinforcing the cultural change.

India's Growth Acceleration Re-Examined||It is commonly believed that India's growth acceleration has been mainly due to a change in the state's attitudes towards business in the early 1980s and not so much because of changes in economic policies. This paper re-examines this argument and shows, first, that the turnaround in growth took place earlier in the late 1970s. It also shows that growth has been mostly driven by the rate of private equipment investment (which increased in the mid-1970s), and that this in turn has been driven by financial deepening, public fixed investment and the relative price of equipment investment. The paper concludes that the effect of the attitudinal shift of the state towards the private sector on growth was of the second order, and if it did have an effect, it was through changes in economic policies, rather than independently of the latter.||Kunal Sen

It brings out the prevalence of widespread disparities and indicates that these differentials are increasing over time. The study clearly reveals that such differentials do not always vary with the extent of poverty prevalent among the people of the state. Also the higher the age at which women have their first child and the earlier the start of breast feeding of newborn children, the less is the prevalence of child malnourishment. It finds the Integrated Child Development Services suited to tackle these aspects and makes a plea to extend it and make it more oriented towards reducing child malnourishment.||K. R. G. Nair

In the recent past, concern has been expressed about the economic and ecological sustainability of this so-called profitable crop. This study attempts inter alia to understand the rationale of farmers' choice of boro paddy harvest in a situation of declining profitability and growth in output, the impact on groundwater reserves in West Bengal and damage to the soil substrate caused by such monocropping. Despite a dearth of scientific data on the polluting effects of agrochemical dumping, indicators show that a large number of farmers of West Bengal who are growing boro paddy are becoming ecologically handicapped.||Sreerupa Ray,Dhrubajyoti Ghosh

The more comprehensive reforms of the 1990s provided a further boost to growth during the post-1991 reform period. The average annual growth rates during the pre-1991 reform and the post-1991 reform periods are significantly different.

And yet, the poverty estimates by the Planning Commission and many individual academics, both using a method that renders irrelevant the question of a nutrition norm, show low levels as well as decline in poverty over the 1990s and beyond. This article proves that both comparisons over time of the all-India and state-level estimates of poverty as well as any comparison at a point in time of poverty levels across states, obtained by this method, are invalid. Using a direct poverty estimation route of inspecting and calculating from current National Sample Survey data the percentage of persons not able to satisfy the nutrition norm in calories, the author finds that in 1999-2000 nearly half of the rural population who are actually poor have been excluded from the set of the officially poor. For 2004-05, while the official estimate of rural poverty is 28.3 per cent, the author's direct estimate of persons below the poverty line is 87 per cent. There is clear evidence of a large and growing divergence over time between the author's direct estimates of poverty and the official indirect estimates.||Utsa Patnaik

The most important feature of such a labour market is the growth of "group" labour contracts particularly with in-migrants in Meerut.

Lastly, this paper demonstrates the increasing importance of non-agricultural employment for the labour households and the pattern of diversification of agricultural labour households in Meerut in the form of dairying.||Vijaya Rajni

Apart from enquiring as to how the VRS optees assess the context in which they had to leave, the article also addresses various related aspects such as reskilling and rehabilitation measures, utilisation pattern of the VRS amount and post-VRS support. It is evident from the field study that many of the voluntarily retired workers were subject to several direct and indirect pressures, prior to their agreement to the voluntary separation scheme.

The increase in credit was to a large extent the result of a growing share of indirect finance, which, in turn, has been broadened in scope to cover many new kinds of farm lending. Moreover, even as direct lending to agriculture has also grown, there has been a Sharp increase in the share of large-sized advances for financing agri-businessoriented enterprises, rather than for the small and marginal farmers.||R.

It examines the genesis of the state's commitment to provide for the health of the people, but argues that in that original commitment lay numerous contradictions and fractures that help to explain the state's relative ineffectiveness in the field of public health. It argues that the nationalist movement's initial commitment to the state provision of welfare arose from a complex combination of motives - a concern with democracy and equity as well as concerns about the "quality" and "quantity" of population. The depth of ambition for public health was unmatched by infrastructure and resources; as a result, the state relied heavily on narrowly targeted, techno-centric programmes assisted by foreign aid. The paper also examines the malaria eradication programme as a case study which reveals the limitations and weaknesses of that approach; the ultimate failure of malaria eradication left a huge dent in the state's commitment to public health.||Sunil Amrith

On the basis of a field study in a pollution affected village in Andhra Pradesh, it demonstrates how sustained demands for the closure of polluting industries based on collective mobilisation and action are met by repression by an uncivil state in nexus with the mafia and economic elites. This in turn pushes collectives to break up and be replaced by interest-based demands either at the level of smaller groups (formed around available social stratifications) or even the individual. This makes it increasingly difficult over a period of time to sustain collective political action that could demand and gain long-term structural changes.||Ajay Gudavarthy,G. Vijay

At first India closely coordinated with the US strategy for the military defeat of the Maoist-led People's War in Nepal, and China acquiesced. But starting in the spring of 2004 both India and China came to reject the US anathema of the Nepali Maoists as "terrorists" and accept them as legitimate actors on the international stage. With the "12-point agreement" in November 2005, the success of the April 2006 urban insurrection, the comprehensive peace agreement in the fall of 2006, and the Maoists entering the government in early April 2007, US intervention in Nepal has, for the time, been thwarted.||John Mage

Capital account liberalisation is one such policy advice. This paper examines the theoretical case for CAL and finds that it is subject to important caveats relating to moral hazard, asymmetric information and agency problems. CAL has proved occasionally beneficial but only for relatively developed countries and only if accompanied by appropriate prudential measures. The line taken by several apologists for CAL that the risks of financial instability are negligible and hence more than compensated by the benefits, ignores the magnitude of the potential costs of a crisis.||D.

A survey in Rajasthan sought to ascertain the extent to which unmarried adolescent girls receive care and support from their parents. Study findings suggest that a majority of them received a high or medium level of care. There was no clear pattern by socio-economic status. In a context where gender discrimination is rife, some families, regardless of their economic circumstances, do seem to provide nutrition, health, and psychosocial care for their adolescent daughters.||Alka Barua,Hemant Apte,Pradeep Kumar

It presents evidence that they are even more deprived than the dalits. However, unlike the dalits, they have been unable to effectively articulate their grievances through the democratic and electoral process. The failures of the state and of the formal political system have provided a space for Maoist revolutionaries to move into. After analysing the reasons for the rise of "Naxalite" influence, the essay concludes that there is a double tragedy at work in tribal India. The first tragedy is that the state has treated its adivasi citizens with contempt and condescension. The second tragedy is that their presumed protectors, the Naxalites, offer no long-term solution either.||Ramachandra Guha

Dalit creative writing did encounter disruption following Partition, but the decades since then have seen an outpouring of literature that focuses on the underprivileged and those on the margins, even as it shows awareness of movements for social justice elsewhere.||Manoranjan Byapari,Meenakshi Mukherjee

The BSP did use caste but only as a metaphor to build innovative grassroot alliances, which demonstrated that the concerns of other communities mattered as much as those of the dalits. A disaggregated analysis, by assembly seats and by region, shows no simple correlations between caste and outcome. The electorates are too large and the social interests too diverse for any simplistic caste calculations to hold. Caste is an important factor, but only one of many; to explain everything in terms of caste robs voters of their secular credentials.||Dipankar Gupta,Yogesh Kumar

The Hodrick-Prescott filtering technique leads to estimated potential GDP growth of about 7 per cent. The warranted growth rate hovers around 8 per cent for the more recent period. The multivariate production function framework yields a potential growth of 6.6 per cent, which could be an underestimate given the data limitations. From the policy perspective, changes in policy instruments are linked to measures of output and the inflation gap within the framework of a policy reaction function.

However, as yet there exist no estimates of the vulnerability of consumption growth in rural India. This paper attempts to fill this lacuna by providing "certainty equivalent growth of consumption" in 14 major states of India over the period 1958-97, corresponding to NSS rounds 13th to 53rd. It is shown that certainty equivalent growth of consumption in rural India has been much lower than average real per capita consumption growth - indeed, in some cases, it has been negative. This points to the poor performance of consumer-perceived average welfare in India's rural sector and should be a matter of urgent policy concern.||Raghbendra Jha

But even as India has become a net exporter of pharmaceuticals, import dependence on active pharmaceutical ingredients has steadily increased over the lasf 10 years. As far as the Indian affiliates of the multinational pharmaceutical companies are concerned, their shares of both the active pharmaceutical ingredients and formulations are declining and their "investment" preferences have shifted towards financial securities. A process of consolidation through mergers and acquisitions has been underway, which apart from increasing market concentration, has been a key element of firm strategy to tap business opportunities along the value chain in the domestic as well as the overseas markets. In the field of R&D, with no Indian pharmaceutical company being equipped to take a potential drug from the invest igational stage to the stage of final market launch, collaboration with multinational corporations is the norm, resulting in biases in the choice of therapeutic areas towards lifestyle-related diseases.||Ravinder Jha

We examine differences in wealth holdings by state and income in the two surveys as well as disparities according to socioeconomic categories in 2002. There have been sharp differences in the growth rates of wealth holdings in the middle and upper income states on the one hand and poor states on the other, suggesting divergence in wealth outcomes. Faster growing states have seen larger increases in wealth inequality.

This policy change, occasioned by the continuing upsurge in capital inflows, is intended to combat inflation but it is cause for worry since any major appreciation in the value of the rupee will have a direct impact on export growth and therefore on the current account deficit as well. It will, at the same time, not help fight inflation, since prices are rising due to domestic supply shortages and growing liquidity.||EPW Research Foundation

This study examines the evolution in the structure of India's cotton seed market and factors that underlie the changes. It finds that the private sector has grown rapidly in the last decade. As the proprietary hybrid seed market has grown, more private players have come into the market, eating away at the share of market leaders. With Bt cotton, the seed industry encompasses a seed market as well as a technology market. To some extent, biosafety laws have protected the monopoly of the incumbent, which has received a significant first mover advantage. However, the market structure is not frozen because of diffusion from illegal seeds, competition from alternative gene suppliers and changing regulatory practices.||Milind Murugkar,Bharat Ramaswami,Mahesh Shelar

These include dependence on usurious moneylenders and the operation of a deeply exploitative grid of interlocked, imperfect markets. We articulate the theoretical and historical case for nationalisation of banks and provide evidence of its positive impact on rural credit and development. Certain excesses led to the reforms of the 1990s, which did increase bank profitability but at the cost of the poor and backward regions. While the microfinance institution model is unsustainable, the self-help group-bank linkage approach of MF can make a positive impact on security and empowerment of the disadvantaged. Much more than MF is, however, needed to overcome the problems that have persisted over the last 100 years.||Mihir Shah,Rangu Rao,P. S. Vijay Shankar

The study suggests that higher ethnic diversity is associated with lower local government spending on all types of public goods under both cross sectional and panel data analysis. Though the role of higher ethnicity is not robust for lower local government spending on all types of public goods, such an ethnic differentiation based on caste lines might lead to greater inequality in status and opportunities, deeper tensions and rivalries, more social conflict and political instability between different caste groups in the region in the future, which, in turn, may be a strong impediment to economic development and growth.||Jhumur Sengupta,Debnarayan Sarkar

Did witch-hunts resume in that they symbolised an attack on the new laws and edicts issued by the "enemy"? Or were they a local response to the varied resistance that the British faced across north India? This article attempts some answers.||Shashank Sinha

A variety of methods have been developed so far to engage the public in prioritising services. This paper deals with a plan that allows variably educated populations who are inexperienced with health insurance to pick health benefits. The decision exercise reported here enhances popular understanding (1) that even within a limited premium there is a choice of different package compositions; and (2) that the level of the premium determines the expectation of coverage by health insurance.||Marion Danis,Erika Binnendijk,Sukumar Vellakkal,Alexander Ost,Ruth Koren,David M.

This was attributed to the practice of early marriage, the inferior status of women in society and tradition-bound health habits. This article examines the opinions of men and women doctors, civic leaders and philanthropists who were involved in campaigning for better healthcare for expectant mothers and in dealing with the reluctance of Indian women to consult male doctors. They also investigated the health of women mill workers, which led to debates in the Bombay legislative council and ultimately in the passing of the Maternity Benefits Act in 1929.||Mridula Ramanna

Despite the government's attempt to achieve this goal through the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, which has a special focus on girl children, students belonging to disadvantaged families still do not attend classes regularly. This paper examines various reasons for poor attendance behaviour of students in formal schools. On the basis of a study in the eastern slums of Kolkata, it finds that retaining the students in a formal school is far more difficult than enrolling them, particularly if the students are from very poor economic backgrounds.||Ratan Khasnabis,Tania Chatterjee

It identifies episodes of high economic growth in each sector in the state over the last two decades and then derives the plausibly optimistic growth potential of the state. In order to examine the feasibility of such optimistic growth targets, a preliminary attempt is made to estimate traditional sources of economic growth in Gujarat in the neoclassical growth accounting framework for the primary and non-primary sectors in the two sub-periods. The article also offers a strategy and policy changes necessary to ensure that higher growth in Gujarat does not take place at the cost of other states, but benefits the nation as a whole.||Ravindra H.

Both were fashioned in late 19th century and drew from the binaries inherited through colonial modernity. Sociologists of religion in India have asserted similar propositions regarding the discrete cultural practices of groups in India, and thereby implicitly propounded a theory of majoritarianism. We need to develop an alternate sociological language and free ourselves from the language of colonial modernity in order to evaluate the processes that make majoritarianism a dominant ideology today.||Sujata Patel

For women particularly, this status of client-hood is linked intimately with ideologies of protectionism and the need to demonstrate protection-worthiness through manufacturing respectability. This reduces rather than enhances women's access to public space. This paper interrogates the discourse of safety in public space to argue that making a claim to the right to take risks in public space rather than petitioning for safety might take women further in the struggle to access public space as citizens. Focusing on Mumbai's growing hierarchies of access to public space, the paper also argues that women's exclusion from public space is linked to the exclusion of other marginal citizens.||Shilpa Phadke

This paper explores the transformation of ideas about the state, democracy and rights, and the impact on political action. A case study of declining jute industrial areas of Kolkata shows that the labouring poor interpret their experience of unemployment and "casualisation" not primarily as an economic phenomenon, but as a political crisis involving the betrayal of the working classes. This perception has led the poor to abandon political activism, to condemn democratic politics as unrepresentative, and to confine their engagement with institutional politics merely to extracting patronage benefits. Working class youth seek to exercise their agency within the urban locality in diverse ways, ranging from extortion and coercion to local community-oriented social work. Politics among this section of the poor is undergoing intense localisation, shunning the wider arena of democratic politics, thus spelling a crisis of political representation and participation.||Nandini Gooptu

It has raised concerns about the level of earnings at which labour is being absorbed in this sector. This paper makes use of NSS data from the quinquennial rounds to throw light on whether labour is being pushed into this sector due to lack of opportunities in other activities. The movement of the distribution of the mean per capita expenditure over successive rounds shows that there has been not only an outward shift of the distribution in the tertiary sector but also an increase in inequality and "dualism" in the sector and within its critical sub-sectors.||Dipak Mazumdar,Sandip Sarkar

This assumption of capital's inevitability continues unshaken even when it is clear that short of state elites' conscious intervention, capitalism just does not seem to take hold.||Aditya Nigam

There were several regiments that were at the head of the resistance against the British, but as this paper argues, in very many instances, their resistance was not representative of wider class and caste interests. A reading of the mutiny across its many centres reveals that the sepoys' resistance, while largely unplanned and even spontaneous, did not reflect the desire to reimpose the traditional order of things, or to even espouse the interests of the old peasant society from which many of them, especially those in the Bengal army, hailed. Moreover, there were also signs that the institutions or the initial order the sepoys sought to establish in centres such as Delhi or Gwalior were more "democratic" and egalitarian in character.||Sabyasachi Dasgupta

Data from the National Family Health Survey of 1998-99 show that while the use of prenatal diagnostic techniques has become fairly common only a minority misuses them for aborting female foetuses. The effect of PNDT use on the sex ratio at birth is found to be contingent on whether women are in the male-selection situation (i e, with at least one previous birth but have had no sons) or not. While income and education are found to increase the use of PNDT, their misuse is governed more by cultural factors and the sex composition of children already born.||P. N. Mari Bhat,A. J.

While the "convergence of interest" or "monitoring" hypothesis predicts a positive relationship, the "entrenchment" hypothesis predicts a negative one. This paper also provides evidence that the relationship between insider shareholding and firm value is not linear in nature and documents a significant non-monotonic relationship between the two. Tobin's Q first increases, then declines and finally rises as ownership by insiders rises. It also confirms that foreign promoter/collaborator shareholding has a significant positive impact on firm value.||Manoj Pant,Manoranjan Pattanayak

The CSS are of two types, one routed through state government budgets, and the other bypassing state budgets. The paper quantifies these and identifies the components of the second going to panchayati raj institutions. For Madhya Pradesh and other major states, the paper provides per capita estimates of CSS releases to the PRIs for 2004-05 and 2005-06.||C. Bhujanga Rao,Manish Gupta,Pratap Ranjan Jena

As a pastoral community, the Gujar population has been subjected to a long period of subordination by an insensitive policy orientation. The very process of mainstream development has succeeded in depriving the Gujars of resources and institutions that were fundamental to their survival. The issue of reservation cannot be examined meaningfully without taking into account the larger ecological dislocation that the Gujars have been subjected to.||Purnendu S. Kavoori

The book in many ways offers an exposition of Gandhi's moral conception of truth, but several aspects of his notions and ideas as they evolved and were enunciated early on in Hind Swaraj we only now being analysed. This essay looks at the conception of "speed", including its relational notion to time, and which, according to philosophers of the Enlightenment, separated the modern from the ancient or the old. In Gandhi's exploration, however, speed also denotes and evokes a comparison between the civilisational ethos that marks out the east from the west.||Shaj Mohan,Divya Dwivedi

Conflicts arise when the interests of the centre differ from those of the states. Though treaty-making power lies with the centre, it needs to consult the states before signing agreements that affect state jurisdiction under the Constitution. Moreover, the process of consultation needs to be institutionalised in the federal polity.||Rekha Saxena

Women's Safety in Public Spaces in Delhi||A city needs to be imagined as a space occupied by diverse sets of people with diverse needs and aspirations. The quality of a city has to be judged by what it offers to its residents - the right to live, move around and work with dignity and safety. Delhi falls short on delivering this to many of its residents, especially the more vulnerable and marginalised populations. We address this issue from the perspective of women's access and right to public spaces. For many women and men, the anonymity of a city's public spaces offers the space and freedom to escape the hold of the family or the traditional community. But for women, this freedom is severely hampered by the high rates of violence against women that have come to define Delhi. In order to understand the gendered nature of access to public spaces and its effect on women's mobility, Jagori conducted over 30 "safety audits" around the city. These audits, along with the findings from a survey of 500 women across the city and several group discussions, provide the data which this paper uses to explore the ways in which public spaces are viewed and accessed differently by men and women.||Kalpana Viswanath,Surabhi Tandon Mehrotra

Term deposits are increasing and lending is also of the long-duration variety. But this does not mean banks are filling the gap created by the exit of development finance institutions: the share of personal long-term loans in total term lending has risen sharply and that of industry has fallen. While within lending to industry the share of term loans has increased, this is a statistical artefact, more the result of companies shifting to non-bank sources for working capital.||EPW Research Foundation

The state of Andhra Pradesh inherited this horrifying tradition of liquidation from the Nizam's police (1946-48) and subsequently from the union government, both during the Telangana movement (1946-51). The policy of "encounters" was revived in the 1960s.

Clearly, this is not because of exogenous countervailing factors, state expenditure and/or an export surplus of goods and services. The rising share of economic surplus in output has been accompanied by greater consumption by the surplus earners themselves and also by greater investment that has been stimulated by such consumption. The ability to introduce technological-cum-structural change through imitation of what prevails in the metropolis is what has kept up the level of aggregate demand in the Indian economy leading to an increase in the rate of economic growth. This article provides a simple model of this growth process and draws certain conclusions regarding its sustainability.||Prabhat Patnaik

The norms may not per se be against the spread of bank lending to those who are now excluded, but with the inherent biases in the functioning of the banking system, banks will seek cover under the norms to half-heartedly move towards inclusion. With serious inter-regional, inter-class and inter-sectoral disparities in banking services in India, the approach should be based on a calibrated balancing of prudential norms and the provision of genuinely inclusive as well as regionally and functionally well-spread services.||EPW Research Foundation

One of the important factors that could affect the outcome of a merger is the relative size of the acquiring and acquired companies. This paper studies the impact of mergers on the operating performance of acquiring corporates by examining some pre-and post-merger financial ratios with a sample of firms chosen from all mergers involving public limited and traded companies in India between 1991 and 2003. The results suggest that there are minor variations in terms of the impact on operating performance following mergers, when the acquiring and acquired firms are of different relative sizes, as measured by market value of equity.||Pramod Mantravadi,A.

The planners themselves are not clear about the space needed for public uses. Hence, when they talk about turning Mumbai into Shanghai, they are only considering an increase in the floor space index but not the public areas. This study introduces two new concepts to help understand and evaluate urban layouts: the public ground area per capita and the buildable plot ratio. Using these concepts, it analyses how the variations of the configuration of private and public spaces affect densities and the working of urban areas. The paper also disagrees with the proposed government policy for Dharavi of resettling slum-dwellers in situ, in free housing paid for by new occupants in additional floor space on the same site.||Shirish B.

In view of these drawbacks of private water markets, many scholars have advocated "alternative institutional arrangements" in water sharing. The alternatives refer to those water sharing arrangements that violate either of the three basic conditions of private water market transactions, viz, private, individual ownership of irrigation assets and rights of the owners of means of irrigation to decide the terms and conditions of water sale. In this paper two alternative institutional arrangements in water sharing from West Bengal have been compared from the perspective of the impact they have on the water buyers - in most cases small and marginal farmers.||Aditi Mukherji

According to standard industrial classifications, these are included in manufacturing. Sixty-four per cent of the unregistered manufacturing establishments in India are, in fact, engaged - more often than not solely - in providing manufacturing services. Generally, these activities are treated as "manufacturing" while estimating domestic product or supply side aggregates, but as "services" while estimating expenditure or use side aggregates. This paper presents a profile of the manufacturing services providing segment of the unregistered manufacturing sector and briefly dwells on the ambiguities inherent in the accepted definitions of "manufacturing" activities and "services". It illustrates the implications of the dual treatment in estimating sectoral distribution of domestic product and concludes that distinguishing manufacturing services from other manufacturing activities in the industrial classification might help resolve this issue as well as related problems in a wide range of applications.||Vishnu Kumar,Aloke Kar,Sanjay

While secularists invoke the Indian tradition of toleration thus pleading for a multicultural India, communalists point to the long experience of religious strife and conclude the necessity of territorial demarcation. Some post-colonial critics even view the very reliance on history as the basic problem. The frequent instances of violence against minorities in connection with disputes over the past give cause to reconsider the role of history in the emergence of the nation state in India. Those obsessed with origin in their idea of the nation assume no perspective of change that would allow heterogeneous elements to merge. Secularists often bring into play only a singular, particular perspective, in which other possible perspectives are neglected. By inserting both the unifying model of the nation state and the diversity of cultural and social forms of life into an overarching perspective of temporal change, a modern form of unity can be accomplished that may be called unity in diversity.||Michael Gottlob

The acquisition of shares through the foreign institutional investor route today paves the way for the sale of those shares to foreign players interested in acquiring companies as and when the demand arises and/or FDI norms are relaxed. This trend of transfer of ownership from Indian to foreign hands would now be aggravated by the private equity boom. Private equity firms can seek out appropriate investment targets and persuade domestic firms to part with a significant share of equity using valuations that would be substantial by domestic wealth standards.||C.

The sustainability of wheat and rice production at the present scale in Punjab has been questioned by some experts, both on economic and ecological grounds. The evaluation of empirical evidence on economic and ecological aspects of wheat-rice cultivation in Punjab, however, shows that it is quite sustainable: the economics of rotation is sound, a growing domestic market is assured for the next few decades and the minimum support prices Programme will continue in the foreseeable future. The returns are the highest among the competing crop rotation combinations and there is no imminent ecological threat The fall in the water table has neither crossed the danger mark nor has the fall been caused by wheat-rice cultivation per se.||H.

Dalit students support the affirmative action policy completely, which allows them to break their traditional marginality.

With a decline in exports, rise in imports and a consequent drop in prices, coupled with frequent droughts, stagnant production and productivity, farm income declined drastically and increased the indebtedness of farmers. A sad manifestation of the severity of the situation was the widespread suicides by farmers in the state. This article examines the factors leading to the farm crisis, the rise in indebtedness and various dimensions of farmer suicides.||P. D. Jeromi

There is a significantly negative trend break in 1992-93, which was the beginning of the liberalisation era in the Indian economy. The entire time period is divided into two sub-periods, namely, 1980-81 to 1991-92 and 1992-93 to 2002-03. We use the method of Computing simple exponential growth rates, kinked exponential growth rates and log quadratic estimates. The former two methods suggest growth and trend breaks, but the latter shows the extent of instability. All eight variables related to the agrarian economy of West Bengal namely, area, production, yield, consumption of fertiliser, proportion of HYV, cropping intensity, institutional credit and land reform show a decline in growth from the first to the second sub-period. All variables except area and land reform register significant deceleration. The trend break was particularly Sharp for production, yield and fertiliser use.||Maumita Bhattacharyya,Sudipta Bhattacharyya

The author takes a close look at these institutions in Karnataka and finds that, in particular, CVCs have not been marginalised by the formal elected bodies. On the contrary, they continue to play an active role. There are also strong interactions between the two sets of institutions, and CVCs have an influence on village politics and grama panchayats with positive as well as negative elements.||Kripa Ananthpur

It examines how the institutional changes brought about by the reforms have contributed to the rise of this distinctly new class of women entrepreneurs who have emerged as significant actors in the rural economy The study examines three key variables – marketing opportunities, access to farm inputs and control over land, which influence their abilities in terms of negotiating the male-dominated institutions of the market. The article focuses on those institutional constraints that restrict these women entrepreneurs from participating equally in the market and make them vulnerable in a number of ways.||Ritu Agarwal

It is centrally concerned with two related issues, the problem of so-called "proxy" women, and the "critical mass" rationale for reservations - whether for women or other excluded groups. Based on a larger research study, the paper argues that while the proxy issue is far more complex than what existing critiques allow, the question of whether women constitute a political identity or force has no easy answers. The relatively neglected world of urban municipal politics presents challenges and opportunities for all those concerned with the relationship of feminism and democracy to questions of politics and power.||Mary E.

"Civil society" organisations that seek to make politics more accountable to the "consumer citizen", are invariably, as this study based in the city of Chennai argues, middle class dominated, and while working to bridge the democratic gap between the ruling class and the governed, do not really involve themselves in primary concerns of the "urban poor". That the urban poor then have no option but to seek the redressal of their concerns by associating themselves with political parties is just one of several contradictions that this new politics throws up.||John Harriss

The model includes the scheduled tax rate as a proxy for time-specific effects along with the explanatory variables - financial leverage, ratio of net property, plant and equipment to total assets and exportability of the companies. Despite separating out the impact of these company characteristics, the size of the companies influences their effective tax rate. The larger the company, the lower is the effective tax rate. The article does not find very clear-cut reasons behind this negative relationship due to lack of transparency on the part of the tax department in revealing information regarding tax returns of the companies. But there may be an unknown factor, built into the political-administrative system of our country, through which larger companies are able to reduce their effective tax rate.||Atulan Guha

One of the key challenges in this respect is to measure the effectiveness of the tax administration. This paper develops an econometric model for indexing the effectiveness of tax administration by using the principal component method to remove the feedback effect between voluntary and enforced compliance. This model shows that there has not been a large change in the effectiveness of the direct tax administration in the country over a period of time, despite the fact that there has been a substantial increase in the quantum of direct tax revenue, particularly over the last few years. This calls for attention to strengthen the tax administration.||Sanjay Kumar,A. L. Nagar,Sayan Samanta

The period between 2000 and 2005 saw a sharp acceleration in workforce growth, and, on the obverse side, a slowdown in the rate of growth of labour productivity across most sectors and in the economy as a whole, and, a slowdown (a decline) in real wage growth in rural (urban) India. Consistent with the trends in labour productivity and real wages, relative to the 1994-2000 period, the pace of poverty reduction between 2000 and 2005 shows, at best, a marginal acceleration (or a marginal deceleration, depending on the choice of poverty lines) in rural India and a clear slowdown in urban India. This period also saw a small rise in the number of working poor and a substantial rise in the number of self-employed and regular wage/salary workers in the "above poverty line" households.||K.

The four-year insurgencyof the 1970s was suppressed by army action. With the federal government attempting to reassert its authority by building new military cantonments and mega development projects across the province, militancy in Balochistan has resurfaced. This paper argues that the present stand-off, while still broadly informed by the traditional concerns of Baloch nationalism, must be considered a response to the state's commitment to intensive neoliberal accumulation. The purely reactionary nature of the insurgency explains its fragmentation.||Aasim Sajjad Akhtar

Though the exchange rate of a currency was theoretically directly linked to the central bank's stock of monetary gold reserves, the countries that had a greater rate of interest elasticity of capital flows could keep a low stock of these reserves. For these countries, interest rate policy was used to stabilise exchange rates. The rate of interest elasticity of capital flows was dependent upon its currency's use as international money. And the degree of use of a currency as international money was dependent upon the issuing country's economic and political hegemony.||Atulan Guha

Two decades later infection rates remained constant while sanitation made little progress. The common people's beliefs and attitudes were blamed for this. The reality was different. It was the RF's diffused focus and the inconsistencies in its approach coupled with the government's lack of commitment to the programme and public health that determined the campaign's results.||Shirish N.

Merit legitimises the privileges and rewards obtained and sought after by the upwardly mobile. At the same time, it is also part of an assumption and acceptance of inequalities between people and thence of the unequal distribution of resources. As a myth of modern India, it has historically legitimised equality, while at the same time obstructing it. The sociology of education helps map the duality of this myth. It also grounds a rethinking of merit, for a fuller expression of freedom, equality and excellence in society.||Amman Madan

Representations of illegality hide unpleasant social realities of the coal mining tracts: poor environmental performance of the state-owned mining sector, social disruption and displacement of communities, and a general decay in the traditional subsistence base. This paper works through the complex layers of mining laws and investigates whether the laws protect the interests of the disadvantaged.

Meanwhile, Maharashtra has achieved an over 100 per cent recovery rate in the irrigation sector since the beginning of 2002-03. This study analyses the factors behind this impressive turnaround in the financial recovery rate. It specifically studies the water rates, working expenditures as well as financial recovery in Maharashtra vis-à-vis other states since the 1970s. The study suggests clearly that the financial recovery rate of the irrigation sector can be increased if economic and institutional reforms are packaged and sequenced appropriately along with an upward revision of water rates.||A.

It reveals how some of these texts cast the rani of Jhansi as cruel and licentious, situating her role in the Rebellion within contemporary colonial stereotypes. However, two unusual novels, Philip Meadows Taylor's Seeta (1872) and Michael White's lesser-known Lachmi Bai, Rani of Jhansi (1901), interestingly enough, drew upon the paradigm of the warrior-woman and projected her as a fearless freedom fighter in a manner that surprisingly fed into later Indian nationalist iconography.||Indrani Sen

The second clear conclusion is that inequality has increased significantly in the post-reform period and seems to have slowed down the rate of poverty reduction. However, changes in poverty in the two sub-periods of the post-reform era, based on mixed reference period data from the NSS, suggest that the extent of decline in 1999-05 seems to have been higher than in 1993-2000, which is surprising given that the latter years witnessed slower growth in agriculture.

In sample areas, poverty had declined by 6.56 percentage points over the period of six years. However, such a reduction was not unidirectional; rather it was the net result of two opposite movements. While some non-poor households slid into poverty, some previously-poor households simultaneously got rid of it. Causal analysis of poverty dynamics reveals that the most important reasons for these opposite movements are largely different from each other. Thus, the need for a difference between poverty avoidance and poverty reduction programmes and policies is emphasised. The paper also recommends that the government should ensure complete enumeration of all households and construction of a household-specific index of income/expenditure status for prioritisation of interventions and better targeting of poor and not-so-poor households.||R.

This has been examined particularly in the context of women as the female student rate of participation in India has been much lower than that of the males at all levels of education.||Sugeeta Upadhyay

Because the very news of a proposed industrial project site breeds speculation of a boom in land prices, no one wants to sell. While there is no better agency than the government to acquire land for industry, protest is inevitable due to the logic of the situation. This is a classic case of the irresistible (industrialisation) dashing against the immovable (millions of peasants and artisans confined to their station). The knot can be broken by opening a window for the latter. This note shows how.||Ranjit Sau

Without the expansion of the rural branch network by the financially strong and dominant public sector banks with staff appropriately qualified for dealing with agriculture and micro enterprises, the objective of a rapid credit expansion is sure to be stifled.

Drawing on statistical analysis, citizen survey and ethnographic research, the paper claims that while people's relative prosperity, not unexpectedly, has a positive effect on their tax contributions, even poorer social groups such as the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes may pay up, driven by a complex mix of motivations ranging from compulsion to contingent compliance. The paper concludes that as gram panchayats begin to rely more on local tax incomes, greater is the probability for a "fiscal contract" to emerge between local taxpayers and an accountable local government.||Manabi Majumdar,Indrashis Banerjee,Sreemoyee Ghosh

Part II looks at the work of later sociologists, who make up a different category: Those who take into account and narrate the historical background of the social reality that constitutes their research. This paper lays stress on the necessity of a "substantive" use of history for sociological purposes. It takes particular note of those sociologists who have used history rigorously to arrive at broader levels of explanation, generalisation and theoretical abstraction, in the process thereby ensuring a "completion" of their sociological mission. It is this process that needs to be further exploited by present day sociologists. [This is the concluding part of the paper; the first part was published last week.]||D. N. Dhanagare

The reforms of the state, and of governance, which have also been undertaken, have been viewed as providing the necessary back up for economic reforms. But, the restructuring of the state has an independent significance. It represents an attempt to incorporate market rationality in the organisation and functioning of the state. Further, the implications of political reforms for democracy in India need to be explored. Since not only democratic institutions but also the humanist ideals which had inspired the social democratic state are now being reinterpreted in line with the neoliberal political agenda, a critical examination of the process becomes important.||Sarah Joseph

It draws on the "new economic geography" literature that evaluates the impact of reforms on regional inequality in a country in terms of the centripetal and centrifugal forces generated in the economy. The results show that regional inequality in India remained largely unchanged during the 1980s but rose dramatically after the adoption of the reforms. This is mainly due to the fact that the per capita output from the industrial and services sectors showed convergence before the reforms and divergence afterwards.||Sabyasachi Kar,S. Sakthivel

Second, the data reveals that no significant improvement in air quality has been made in the post- regulation period, alluding to the fact that the reduction in air pollution because of CNG regulations on buses, taxis and autorickshaws has been offset by a phenomenal increase in the number of private vehicles, particularly cars and non-CNG heavy vehicles.||Naresh Kumar,Andrew D.

The paper first summarises the most important causes for depletion of groundwater in Punjab and Haryana. It then reports a regional study of Haryana using the Nerlovian supply response function. Supply response is estimated for two water-intensive crops (rice and sugar cane) and two less water-demanding crops (wheat and bajra). The Arellano-Bond Dynamic Panel estimator is used in the study. The regression results confirm the hypothesis that farmers are recognising and responding to declining depths of water tables.

Yet economists pose the question: should economists pay attention to philosophers? If anything, it is economics that raises serious philosophic issues. Can economics, a subject of cognitive dissonance with no predictive power, claim to be a science? Economic laws are at best statements of tendencies which make it "a discipline, not a science", for it "deals with the ever changing and subtle forces of human nature". But economics does adhere to the scientific method and the criteria of falsifiability. Paradoxically, despite its deficiencies, economics has emerged as the imperial social science and economists function as imperial advisors to government and civil society. Economics and philosophy are both techniques of analysis rather than bodies of doctrine. The most fruitful approach to the interface between economics and philosophy is through the relevant sub-disciplines of philosophy, viz, epistemology, religion, ethics, psychology as well as rhetoric.||Anand Chandavarkar

In the 1960s Kaldor put forward certain hypotheses linking growth of output, employment and productivity in the manufacturing sector. Testing those hypotheses with Indian data may illuminate the nature of the growth process in Indian manufacturing. In particular, they may shed new light on differences in regional patterns of growth in India over the period 1970- 71 to 2002-03. The paper focuses on two states, namely, West Bengal and Gujarat, experiencing different types of growth.||Panchanan Das

Energy Squeeze on India's Smallholder Irrigation||India's smallholder irrigation is in the grip of an energy squeeze and is proving the proverbial last straw on the camels back Marginal farmers and sharecroppers are particularly badly hit. Typically, they depend on pump owners for renting pumps, and even as prices have stayed put, the rental rates have risen in tandem with every diesel price hike because of the monopoly power of pump owners in these localised, village-level, informal oligopolies. Pump rentals have also tended to be downwardly sticky - they rise when diesel prices jump but stay put when fuel prices fall. This paper synthesises the results of 15 village studies to understand the impact of the energy squeeze and explores the desperate responses smallholders are forging to cope with or absorb the energy shock, and somehow stay in irrigated agriculture.||Tushaar Shah

Dalits and other marginalised groups adhere to such deras for it promises them an alternative to mainstream, and in many respects, exclusionary Sikhism.

What would be different is the manner in which surplus savings are being managed. The real problem today is not a macroeconomic one to be alleviated by a complex policy coordination of monetary and fiscal policies.

The projected average energy and peak shortages in the state for 2007-08 are 2,600 MW and 4,500 MW, respectively. Demand side management and captive generation can be used to reduce the quantum of load shedding. The possible impact of augmenting generation from installed captive capacity and a few DSM options like efficiency for residential lighting and solar water heaters has been quantified. It is estimated that the average energy and peak shortage for 2007-08 can be reduced to 680 MW and 2,000 MW using these selected options.||Chandrarao More,Sarag J. Saikia,Rangan Banerjee

The impact of such changes on the financial sector s contribution to the gross domestic product seems to be quite significant. These changes are conceptually intricate and their implementation would also be challenging. This paper presents a prospective view of the ensuing changes as debated in international forums. In addition, two key issues, namely, the valuation of GDP of the banking sector at constant prices and the treatment of non-performing loans of banks in national accounts are discussed. The paper also highlights that the adjustment of financial intermediation services, indirectly measured, for the incidence of non- performing loans will have significant effects on the estimated macroeconomic aggregates on financial activities.||A.

Such holdings remain, however, large and draw attention to their risk as interest rates are increasing. This paper reviews the reasons why such holdings are so large and measures their interest rate risk using duration/convexity and value-at-risk methods. The first key finding is that, at end-March 2004, some public sector and old private banks were vulnerable to a reversal of the interest rate cycle, while foreign and new private banks had built adequate defences. The second key finding is that recent changes in regulation such as the move to Basel I and the road map to Basel II are important as they make Indian banks' capital more sensitive to interest rate risk.||Amadou Sy

This is something of a puzzle given the reported rise in monthly per capita rural expenditure between the two rounds. The decline in unemployment among males with secondary school or higher education, relative to illiterate males, suggests that the rise in rural prosperity closely matches the pattern of access to rural school facilities. Of the four disadvantaged groups tested for, scheduled tribes face the highest incremental unemployment, which remains unchanged into the 61st round. This is an important pointer to the required regional configuration of workfare programmes like the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, and for the spread of rural schools.||Abhiroop Mukhopadhyay,Indira Rajaraman

In key aspects, such as employment per unit, capital intensity, labour productivity and capacity expansion, the state's industry has performed only marginally better than the national average. And, except for labour productivity, all the other key performance parameters have shown a declining trend.

Nevertheless, their participation was characterised by clustering in the feminine, non-professional and non-market courses offered in general education. The pressures for change emanating from globalisation came when the higher education system was unable to meet the rising social demand for professional education. Therefore, globalisation has meant privatisation and increased individual cost of higher education. This paper looks at these myriad issues and asks how women have been affected by the increasing individual cost and the change in the subject options offered by higher education.||Karuna Chanana

This is carried out by first computing a household specific air pollution exposure index for 347 households around seven pollution monitoring stations in Delhi. The index is then used in a multivariate regression to look into the environmental equity aspect. The analysis yields that the economically backward communities are the most affected by the exposure to air pollution. However, the study does not find any evidence of environmental inequity due to religion and social backwardness. Education facilitates defence against the exposure, when it crosses a threshold level. The separate analysis of residential and industrial areas suggests that exposure to air pollution is dependent, though not systematically, on the location of residence, besides socio-economic status.||Vinish Kathuria,Nisar A.

Yet, this has received very little attention in the empirical economic literature on producer behaviour and productivity. This paper estimates the contribution of services to output growth and productivity in Indian manufacturing using the capital-labour-energy-materials-services production function. Panel data estimations are undertaken for 148 three-digit level industries for 18 years, 1980-81 to 1997-98 and sources of growth are analysed. The results show that the contribution of services input to output and productivity growth in manufacturing (organised) has increased substantially in the 1990s. One of the major causes for this is found to be the trade reforms undertaken in the post-1990s period.||Rashmi Banga,Bishwanath Goldar

Emerging evidence highlights that neither of these assumptions are tenable.

The analysis is based on the National Sample Survey's reports of employment and unemployment pertaining to the latest rounds, which provide information on migration. Economic deprivation is not the most critical factor for migration decisions, even for seasonal migrants. People migrate out of both poor and rich households, although the reasons for migration and the nature of jobs sought by them are different. Rural-urban migrants have a greater risk of being below the poverty line than the urban-urban migrants, but both report a lower risk than non-migrants. The probability of a person being poor is low in a large city compared to any other urban centre, irrespective of the migration status, age, number of subsidiary activities undertaken, etc. The results indicate that migration has been a definite instrument of improving economic well-being and escaping from poverty. The probability of being poor is much less among the migrants compared to the local population, in all size classes of urban centres.||Amitabh Kundu,Niranjan Sarangi

According to the proposed measure, the stance of monetary policy has been mildly contractionary over this period with its emphasis on inflation control. The constructed measure of monetary policy stance is then linked to output and prices in a three-variable vector autoregression framework, which indicates that, for the period of study, the potency of monetary policy seemed to have been more effective in price control vis-a-vis stimulating output growth.||Indranil Bhattacharyya,Partha Ray

From the mid-1980s to the millennium, the Muttahida Quami Movement was engaged in a conflict in Karachi involving high levels of violence with other ethnic groups, rival factions and the state. Drawing on the biographies of a minority of celebrated career "killers", this paper examines how violence emerged as a solution to the mohajir predicament.

The early 19th century was a time of experimentation, it was a period of acquaintance and also of open ideological debate. Barely a few decades later, however, and especially following the revolt of 1857, as the Raj asserted itself, and imperialism gained in zeal, some of this early experimentation was lost in the drive for more Anglicisation of education. The setting up of the universities in the three presidency towns reflected the growing assertiveness in colonial ideology. This article, however, looks at two experiments in education, located in the vernacular medium, that had their origins in the earlier period of new understanding, but were decisively affected by the events of 1857 and reactions to it.||Anu Kumar

The absence of a suitable methodology of assessment means that not only does their contribution remain vague but there is also a lack of solid data to draw policy inferences in terms of operationalisation of food security and women's empowerment. This article, based on research conducted in two villages in Nanded, Maharashtra, seeks to quantify women's contribution to household food security. Through investigation into the time-use pattern of women's activities, it also arrives at a method to estimate how much women contribute to security with their visible and invisible work.||Neetu Choudhary,D.

The mode of financing higher education is crucial for understanding how higher education is provided to society and at what price. Despite recent increases in budgetary allocation for higher education, the importance of exploring alternative sources of financing higher education remains. This paper reviews literature on government intervention in education and discusses the pros and cons of some alternative sources of financing higher education from the point of view of social justice and efficiency in allocation of resources. It argues that keeping in mind India's imperatives, the government has to continue to play a leading role in the provision of higher education. Among the measures suggested, fee enhancement and education loans are of limited significance in a country like India.||Saumen Chattopadhyay

Analysis reveals that the state-level effects of various RCH services are significantly higher than those at the district level. The pace of annual progress after 1998 in many RCH indicators is slower than before and a few indicators (e g, child-immunisation) have worsened, despite the expenditure on the programme being doubled. Decentralisation and integration of basic healthcare services may not be effective unless monitored centrally and backed by full time health (medical/paramedical) professionals at the delivery level.||K.

However, the focus on reform should be complemented with an exploration of alternatives outside the IMF, which hold the potential to give developing countries greater bargaining leverage with the Fund, and by increasing competition so as to spur the institution to better performance. This paper focuses on the insurance role of the Fund and argues that developing countries are turning to alternative insurance mechanisms - from a higher level of reserves, to regional co-insurance facilities, to remittances - as a counter-cyclical source of foreign exchange. The de facto exit of the IMF's clientele driven by the high political costs associated with Fund borrowing, now poses unprecedented challenges, in particular pressures on the Fund's income. In order to maintain its role as an insurance mechanism, the IMF needs to undergo a rapid restructuring and significantly cut its administrative budget, with the budget savings used to lower the interest rates charged to borrowers.||Devesh Kapur,Richard Webb

Due to increases in absorption, real private investment and output in all other sectors also seem to increase, resulting in several other macroeconomic changes. With a 20 per cent sustained increase in public investment in infrastructure, the government can accelerate real growth by 1.8 percentage points in the medium to long run, six to 10 years after the policy change. This will be accompanied by a 0.2 percentage point decline in the rate of inflation. The increase in income will lead to a 0.7 percentage point annual reduction in poverty in rural India. This shows the potential for achieving the much-debated 10 per cent aggregate real GDP growth in the Indian economy.||K. N. Murty,A. Soumya

It also critically assesses the rigour with which a reconstruction of past events and experiences has been attempted so as to understand and explain the present in sociological studies in India. While reviewing seminal writings of scholars who used Indology extensively, as also those of sociologists who have attempted systematic use of history in macroanalysis, this paper focuses attention on contributions of Indian sociologists who have used the historical method rigorously in rural studies, as also in studies of social movements, agrarian structure and change, caste and analysis of industrial and urban settings. Finally, it distinguishes between "metaphoric" and "substantive" use of history and opines that the real potential of historical sociology lies in the latter. It also expresses optimism that despite the initial indifference of Indian sociologists towards history, they are now rediscovering their discipline's roots in history and are also realising its intrinsic value in generating, what Earnest Nagel (1961) called, "historical explanation".

That Pakistan permits product patents while India does not is factually incorrect. This paper argues that a weak patent regime combined with policies to reduce market concentration, curb monopolies and encourage bulk drug production, initially through public sector investments, and the size of the Indian market could have led to development of indigenous process capabilities. Meanwhile, in Pakistan, the same patent policy was not combined with policies adopted in India and since the market size is much smaller, it did not have the same effect.||Rakesh Basant

While liquidity explosion becomes the logical corollary of the RBI's exchange rate management, the latter does not seem to have a strict correspondence with the emergence of recent inflationary pressures. In the face of the dollar's weakness and perennial capital inflows, the RBI has accomplished a balancing act of stabilising the real effective exchange rate and not allowing the nominal exchange rate to move according to the dictates of speculative global finance.||M.

These interventions have not led to any major increase in the availability of crude oil for the country. The time is thus right to intervene from the demand side by introducing, among other things, fuel economy standards for vehicles and efficient pricing and taxation policies to alter travel demand as a different strategy to address oil security, which should be taken as a complement to the supply side interventions.||Chirag Shah

The paper elaborates on how women's collective identity can be forceful politically when backed by knowledge and gives examples of this from Karnataka. New developments in decentralisation of governance have opened possibilities for women's agency at the local level. Paradoxically, developments at the global level have the possibility of undermining this process. The author argues that we can only therefore confront this not by integrating into the existing development paradigm and attempting small changes at the local level but by evolving a different development paradigm that will ensure justice for the majority of the poor and women.||Devaki Jain

The GVA estimates are first obtained for the benchmark year as a product of workforce estimate with the GVA per worker. These are moved forward to get the corresponding values for subsequent years by making use of physical and price indicators. In this paper we discuss the problems in getting the estimates of workforce for the base year. In most cases consumer price indices are used to estimate GVA per worker at current prices. It also discusses the problems relating to the use of physical indicators. Sgme suggestions for improving the estimates are given.||M. R. Saluja,Bhupesh Yadav

Caste, a defining feature of the community in India, has been a vital socio-economic institution since historical times. But it is Indian politics, especially since post-independence, that has been shaped by competing communities and the ascendancy "acquired" by certain communities over the other. However, as this article suggests, the two categories are not wholly disparate; rather it is the middle class that has been largely responsible for spearheading the interests of their respective communities. A potent tool in this ascendancy has been the issue of "reservations".||Andre Beteille
