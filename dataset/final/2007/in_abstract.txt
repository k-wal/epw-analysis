The 2006 Stern report concluded that the economic costs of climate change are significant. There are many ways to mitigate climate change, and results of action undertaken through the Kyoto Protocol are now visible. This paper examines alternative policies for mitigating and adapting to climate change, beyond the year 2012 horizon of Kyoto, and how India can play an important role in this effort.||Gautam Dutt,Fabian Gaioli

The paper finds that user charges do not adequately cover the production costs of supplying water or expenditure on sewerage. The bottlenecks to reforming public service delivery are financial and institutional, as they pertain to existing arrangements for water and sewerage. Possible reform actions to improve service delivery are changes in institutional arrangements for delivery, privatisation, and citizen participation.||Kala Seetharam Sridhar

While past efforts to solve this problem have focused on technocratic approaches, this paper attempts to articulate a political interpretation of the electridty-groundwater conundrum. The paper argues that farmers are quite rational in their current decision-making given the problematic context within which they make choices. It outlines a more explicitly political approach to the problem, based on State level bargains between stakeholders and a multifaceted approach to implementing bargains.||Navroz K. Dubash

Among other things, the restrictions on harvesting of surface water in the catchment area of the Gandhi Sagar dam have resulted in huge ecological and social costs to the people of Malwa region in the state. The share of Rajasthan in the net available water from the project is far greater than the water utilised by MP.

Using data from secondary sources and a vehicular survey, estimates of annual air pollution abatement cost for vehicles complying with Euro norms are made for the road transport sector in Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. The pollution abatement cost of each vehicle comprises the cost of upgrading vehicular technology and cost of improving fuel quality. For example, the annual pollution abatement cost for a passenger car complying with Euro III norms is estimated at Rs 7,190 and Rs 6,624 for AP and HP, respectively. If all vehicles comply with Euro III norms, total air pollution abatement cost of the road transport sector constitutes 2.13 per cent and2.16per cent of state domestic product of the respective states.||Sushmita Chatterjee,Kishore K.

On the basis of a field study in a pollution affected village in Andhra Pradesh, it demonstrates how sustained demands for the closure of polluting industries based on collective mobilisation and action are met by repression by an uncivil state in nexus with the mafia and economic elites. This in turn pushes collectives to break up and be replaced by interest-based demands either at the level of smaller groups (formed around available social stratifications) or even the individual. This makes it increasingly difficult over a period of time to sustain collective political action that could demand and gain long-term structural changes.||Ajay Gudavarthy,G. Vijay

In view of these drawbacks of private water markets, many scholars have advocated "alternative institutional arrangements" in water sharing. The alternatives refer to those water sharing arrangements that violate either of the three basic conditions of private water market transactions, viz, private, individual ownership of irrigation assets and rights of the owners of means of irrigation to decide the terms and conditions of water sale. In this paper two alternative institutional arrangements in water sharing from West Bengal have been compared from the perspective of the impact they have on the water buyers - in most cases small and marginal farmers.||Aditi Mukherji

The sustainability of wheat and rice production at the present scale in Punjab has been questioned by some experts, both on economic and ecological grounds. The evaluation of empirical evidence on economic and ecological aspects of wheat-rice cultivation in Punjab, however, shows that it is quite sustainable: the economics of rotation is sound, a growing domestic market is assured for the next few decades and the minimum support prices Programme will continue in the foreseeable future. The returns are the highest among the competing crop rotation combinations and there is no imminent ecological threat The fall in the water table has neither crossed the danger mark nor has the fall been caused by wheat-rice cultivation per se.||H.

Meanwhile, Maharashtra has achieved an over 100 per cent recovery rate in the irrigation sector since the beginning of 2002-03. This study analyses the factors behind this impressive turnaround in the financial recovery rate. It specifically studies the water rates, working expenditures as well as financial recovery in Maharashtra vis-à-vis other states since the 1970s. The study suggests clearly that the financial recovery rate of the irrigation sector can be increased if economic and institutional reforms are packaged and sequenced appropriately along with an upward revision of water rates.||A.

Second, the data reveals that no significant improvement in air quality has been made in the post- regulation period, alluding to the fact that the reduction in air pollution because of CNG regulations on buses, taxis and autorickshaws has been offset by a phenomenal increase in the number of private vehicles, particularly cars and non-CNG heavy vehicles.||Naresh Kumar,Andrew D.

The paper first summarises the most important causes for depletion of groundwater in Punjab and Haryana. It then reports a regional study of Haryana using the Nerlovian supply response function. Supply response is estimated for two water-intensive crops (rice and sugar cane) and two less water-demanding crops (wheat and bajra). The Arellano-Bond Dynamic Panel estimator is used in the study. The regression results confirm the hypothesis that farmers are recognising and responding to declining depths of water tables. Farmers are reducing the acreage devoted to rice and sugar cane, the two most water-intensive crops but not for the less water-intensive crops.||Priya Bhalla

This is carried out by first computing a household specific air pollution exposure index for 347 households around seven pollution monitoring stations in Delhi. The index is then used in a multivariate regression to look into the environmental equity aspect. The analysis yields that the economically backward communities are the most affected by the exposure to air pollution. However, the study does not find any evidence of environmental inequity due to religion and social backwardness. Education facilitates defence against the exposure, when it crosses a threshold level. The separate analysis of residential and industrial areas suggests that exposure to air pollution is dependent, though not systematically, on the location of residence, besides socio-economic status.||Vinish Kathuria,Nisar A.

Attempts to evict local villagers without evidence of effective rehabilitation measures are a natural corollary of this policy. This paper appraises the role of village relocation as a management tool for wildlife conservation in the reserve by (1) documenting the forest dependency and livelihood conflicts faced by local residents who will be displaced; (2) identifying the aspirations of the proposed oustees in relation to the proposed displacement; and (3) studying the process of relocation planning and the rehabilitation package. It also suggests more participatory and rational ways to deal with the issue.||Ghazala Shahabuddin,Ravi Kumar,Manish Shrivastava

Though the project is based on the principle of participatory irrigation management, hardly any water users' associations have taken over canal management below the level of the minor canal. This study attempts to understand the dynamics of canal irrigation management at the village service area in the absence of proper infrastructure development and institutional arrangements.||Jayesh Talati,Dhaval Pandya

There are, however, many issues concerning its contribution to reducing the build-up of greenhouse gases and the role of developing countries, including India, in such trading.||Patrick Nussbaumer
