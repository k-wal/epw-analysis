The report not only tramples upon the sovereign rights of states to have their own environmental protection regimes, but also goes a long way to legitimise green protectionism. It further raises the issue of the place and function of the dispute settlement system in the WTO scheme of things. Unless important third world countries like India act to prevent the dispute settlement machinery from assuming an extraconstitutional role, their trade and development cause would suffer irredeemable damage.||B.

Ironically, the anticipated economic gains from it now stand questioned as industrial countries are increasingly rejecting cashew kernel imports contaminated by chemical spraying.||S. Rajendran

This paper, an attempt to examine the extent of women's involvement in forestry and their role in JFM in West Bengal, observes that despite women's greater involvement in forestry, the state JFM resolution has proved inadequate for ensuring their participation in community institutions.||Debnarayan Sarker,Nimai Das

As this paper argues, the brahminic theory of a varna social structure based on the notions of purity and pollution is systematically mapped on to the framework of the trophic system as developed in the field of ecology. The evolution of castes follow the logic of Darwinian principles elaborated in the field of population ecology. The emergence of untouchability is seen as an ecologically determined adaptation contributing to the fitness and survival of those regarded as untouchable. Untouchability and the varna framework are inseparably joined by an ecological logic. It is not possible to preserve in any way the identities of caste and at the same time hope to eradicate untouchability.||Purnendu S. Kavoori

Ecology in a Climate of Cold War Suspicion||Ecologists in India, as well as other parts of the world, acted throughout the 1950s and 1960s as if their research funding did not have any political or ethical import. Ecologists had been accustomed to taking money from any funding source and attempting to do their own work while also fulfilling grant requirements. In doing so they often implicitly supported institutions or policies that they might not have actually supported. The now controversial Bharatpur bird-banding project, in the late 1960s, the first large-scale study of bird migration in India, receiving funds as it did from the US Army is a case in point. It led in complex and unfortunate ways to a tighter government control over ecological research projects.||Michael Lewis

Therefore, the different narratives of the violence discussed here, along with their internal nuances, will continue to shape and influence collective memories. In a sense, these narratives, in the larger context of the environmental factors, will influence the political orientations of the people.||Riaz Ahmad

The indigenous populations within the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary who have traditionally had access to its resources now regard its construction as a means of curtailing their right of access to forest resources and for appropriating land previously used by them for cultivation. Their struggle in turn, has involved the reconstruction of their environmental and social history that is an attempt to assert the validity of the local sense of place over more abstract conceptions of space, imposed on them from above. Their oral reconstruction of history, kinship and identity is actually a response to the threat of dislocation, in which a concept of space without people has taken precedence over local interactions with, and interpretations of, the environment.||Judy Whitehead

There is no clear and coherent thrust towards integrating these concerns throughout the paper, within all sectors. Even at this late stage, it would be fruitful for the Planning Commission to set up a group of independent persons to consider ways of achieving such integration.||Ashish Kothari

Based on a survey of farmers, the paper analyses the parameters of production, extending it to estimate the affordable area under rice cultivation from the point of view of sustainability.||Karam Singh,Sajla Kalra

The capital/nature relationship, however, is a complex one, influenced by several social and environmental factors, including modes of social relations and various forms of property. This paper attempts to illustrate this argument by analysing a specific historical situation - an inquiry into experiments with flood control in the delta regions of eastern India over 150 years. This region was transformed over this period from a flood dependent agrarian regime to a flood vulnerable landscape - a transformation effected by British colonial rule that not only instituted a new regime of property but also oversaw the deployment of numerous technical interventions. This colonial attempt to synchronise the hydraulic environment with its administrative needs and to subordinate the region to capitalist relations offers an example in which to map the basic dynamics between capital and nature and thereby enable us to address the question raised at the outset - how capital transforms nature.||Rohan D'Souza

In 1960 it was the fourth largest lake in the world; today it is on the verge of deteriorating into a small and dirty waterhole. The destruction of the Aral Sea is an example of how quickly environmental and humanitarian tragedy can threaten a whole region. The destruction of the Aral Sea is a textbook example of unsustainable development.||Rama Sampath Kumar

His work was marked by his striking ability to synthesise the results of specialised scientific studies; his knack of communicating this synthesis in accessible prose; and the insistence that it was not enough for the environmentalist to hector and chastise, but offer solutions as well even if the state was unwilling to accept them as yet.||Ramachandra Guha

Under this regime precaution precedes scientific proof under the pretext of risk to human health and environmental damage. However, the WTO ruling on the beef-hormone case between the EU and the US establishes a definite link between trade and precautionary approach.||Swapan K. Bhattacharya

Two scenarios are provided - business as usual (BAU) as well as sustainable energy planning (SEP). The SEP scenario includes the introduction of various policies and practices that reduce energy demand through energy efficiency measures, fuel switching, appropriate energy pricing mechanism, environmental policies, etc. The implementation of these measures reduces the energy consumption levels and significantly improves the environment both at local and global levels.||B.

The region has seen several efforts in this direction by the local rulers as far back as 1854 and later the state governments. While Wood's Despatch of 1854 brought many reforms in education in India this was followed by various commissions and committees which gave a fillip to women's education. After 1956 and up to 1976 these initiatives were part of development programmes implemented with the active participation of NGOs to empower women, especially tribal women. After 1976 mass literacy campaigns, environmental and women's movements have contributed extensively to the progress of women's education. This region of Karnataka has also seen considerable private investment in women's education.||Usha Ramkumar

Appropriate policies for technology development and dissemination, though, can yield significant economic, environmental and social benefits, and need to be considered as part of a diversified portfolio of strategies to meet the country's pressing energy goals. Attention needs to be paid to the development of appropriate ER and D policies and a portfolio that is consistent with the needs of various sections of the country's citizenry and economy. What all of this requires, above all, is a focus on revamping the process of ER and D planning and implementation.||Ambuj Sagar

The difference is that the first set of problems are intra-sectoral while the second is inter-sectoral. This paper attempts to study the environmental impact of water pollution on rural communities in general and on agricultural production, human health, and livestock in particular. Some important issues in this regard are (a) linkages between industrial development and changes in the micro (local) environment; (b) damage to crops and animal husbandry due to industrial pollution; and (c) impact on health and sanitation in rural communities. These issues are studied in detail with the help of primary data collected from a pollution-affected village in Andhra Pradesh.||Bhagirath Behera,V. Ratna Reddy
