The report not only tramples upon the sovereign rights of states to have their own environmental protection regimes, but also goes a long way to legitimise green protectionism. It further raises the issue of the place and function of the dispute settlement system in the WTO scheme of things. Unless important third world countries like India act to prevent the dispute settlement machinery from assuming an extraconstitutional role, their trade and development cause would suffer irredeemable damage.||B.

The attempt to find quick-fix solutions has perennially hindered long-term planning and process, and setting up of institutional arrangements coupled with legal and legislative support. In this context, it will be helpful for India to study the comprehensive water policy document introduced in South Africa and draw relevant lessons for an integrated approach to water management.||V.

This paper, an attempt to examine the extent of women's involvement in forestry and their role in JFM in West Bengal, observes that despite women's greater involvement in forestry, the state JFM resolution has proved inadequate for ensuring their participation in community institutions.||Debnarayan Sarker,Nimai Das

As this paper argues, the brahminic theory of a varna social structure based on the notions of purity and pollution is systematically mapped on to the framework of the trophic system as developed in the field of ecology. The evolution of castes follow the logic of Darwinian principles elaborated in the field of population ecology. The emergence of untouchability is seen as an ecologically determined adaptation contributing to the fitness and survival of those regarded as untouchable. Untouchability and the varna framework are inseparably joined by an ecological logic. It is not possible to preserve in any way the identities of caste and at the same time hope to eradicate untouchability.||Purnendu S. Kavoori

Ecology in a Climate of Cold War Suspicion||Ecologists in India, as well as other parts of the world, acted throughout the 1950s and 1960s as if their research funding did not have any political or ethical import. Ecologists had been accustomed to taking money from any funding source and attempting to do their own work while also fulfilling grant requirements. In doing so they often implicitly supported institutions or policies that they might not have actually supported. The now controversial Bharatpur bird-banding project, in the late 1960s, the first large-scale study of bird migration in India, receiving funds as it did from the US Army is a case in point. It led in complex and unfortunate ways to a tighter government control over ecological research projects.||Michael Lewis

The indigenous populations within the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary who have traditionally had access to its resources now regard its construction as a means of curtailing their right of access to forest resources and for appropriating land previously used by them for cultivation. Their struggle in turn, has involved the reconstruction of their environmental and social history that is an attempt to assert the validity of the local sense of place over more abstract conceptions of space, imposed on them from above. Their oral reconstruction of history, kinship and identity is actually a response to the threat of dislocation, in which a concept of space without people has taken precedence over local interactions with, and interpretations of, the environment.||Judy Whitehead

Most of the progressive trends in social activism today can be traced indirectly to the issues raised by or associated with the Naxalite movement in 1960s. But the disquieting trends in the movement today are actually manifestations of a deeper ideological crisis that has overtaken the old strategy and tactics of the leadership. What was appropriate in Maoist China in the 1930s cannot be replicated in the India of the 21st century. The crucial condition for the survival of the Naxalites is a new broad-based socialist movement with new organisational strategies, which would carry them forward into a wider political arena.||Sumanta Banerjee

The capital/nature relationship, however, is a complex one, influenced by several social and environmental factors, including modes of social relations and various forms of property. This paper attempts to illustrate this argument by analysing a specific historical situation - an inquiry into experiments with flood control in the delta regions of eastern India over 150 years. This region was transformed over this period from a flood dependent agrarian regime to a flood vulnerable landscape - a transformation effected by British colonial rule that not only instituted a new regime of property but also oversaw the deployment of numerous technical interventions. This colonial attempt to synchronise the hydraulic environment with its administrative needs and to subordinate the region to capitalist relations offers an example in which to map the basic dynamics between capital and nature and thereby enable us to address the question raised at the outset - how capital transforms nature.||Rohan D'Souza

Those, particularly NGOs committed to gender priority would like women to be brought in the 'mainstream' of irrigation management by encouraging them to participate actively in the affairs of water users' associations. The paper that seeks to examine such an approach, begins with reporting on the interaction with women groups in six villages which had different sources of water for domestic use but one common feature - they were all served by a canal. Participatory rural appraisal conducted in these villages brought out that women's priority concern was very largely for water for domestic use. These women had hardly any interest in canal waters as they were perceived to be meant for agriculture, not for meeting 'their' priority requirements. How can canals serve better the women priority needs for domestic use of water? What can women do for improving the canal management and better functioning of water users' associations.||Anil C. Shah

The paper finds that organising communities to give them collective voice, giving them opportunities to make critical decisions on what the projects will do and making them share a portion of the costs are essential aspects of implementation processes to enhance community participation. A realistic strategy must also seek to change the capabilities and incentives of government bureaucracies themselves by creating situations in which it is in their best interest to work with communities.||Shashi L.

Its recommendation is to bring river water disputes within the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. This article argues that the repeal of the ISWD Act would be singularly ill-advised. Article 262 together with the ISWD Act represents a very good mechanism for dispute-resolution (as a last resort when negotiations fail) and it would be a great pity to dismantle it. There have been some deficiencies in the functioning of that mechanism; the amendments to the ISWD Act passed in early 2002 seek to remedy them and some further improvements are suggested here. The NCRWC is right in wanting to restore the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, but it should be appellate Jurisdiction.||Ramaswamy R. Iyer

In the context of Indian forestry for instance, forest guards are the representatives of the forest department in rural society, who interpret and explain forest policies to local people. Thus far, little literature has been devoted to their perceptions of forest policy and administration and the social context in which they function.

The 97 families who belong to the Gond and Naikpod tribes formed themselves into a forest protection group in 1990, but the state government officially recognised their efforts in 1993. In 1998, five years after the recognition of the committee - referred to as Vana Samarakshana Samithi, or VSS - Behroonguda residents began to derive usufruct benefits from the forest. The case study documents the efforts of the villagers, the costs they have borne and the benefits they have derived from protecting 500 hectares of degraded forest allotted to them as part of the joint forest management (JFM) in Andhra Pradesh. The VSS is widely regarded as being successful. The paper analyses the reasons for the success of JFM and compares the experience of Behroonguda with other similar experiments in other countries to draw important lessons. The paper strikes one discordant note: The people of Behroonguda have not been clearly told when the forest department's financial and technical support would end. For JFM to be sustainable, it is important that forest staff be redeployed to other needy communities and the financial support to silvicultural and other conservation activities be discontinued. Only then will the Behroonguda experiment be deemed fully successful and sustainable.||Emmanuel D'Silva,B. Nagnath

Further, it was a mere 'amendment' exercise, and the resulting document can hardly be described as a 'new policy'. The two most egregious failures of the new NWP are in relation to water-harvesting and community management of water. The prime minister's speech to the NWRC stressed both, but there is nothing corresponding to this in the NWP. Important controversies such as those relating to water as 'commodity' versus water as 'commons' or 'a basic right', the desirability of water markets, etc, are ignored. A valuable opportunity for a comprehensive review and a well-considered new statement has been lost. However, NWP 2002 is now the officially declared policy, and will stay in place for some years. While pointing out deficiencies and calling for revisions, the attempt must be to see what can be done with the document as it exists.

Attention needs to be paid to the development of appropriate ER and D policies and a portfolio that is consistent with the needs of various sections of the country's citizenry and economy. What all of this requires, above all, is a focus on revamping the process of ER and D planning and implementation.||Ambuj Sagar

After analysing the process of planning and implementation of the projects, the possible causes of time and cost overruns and of the inability to meet the project's goals are investigated. The study also highlights the possible gains from effective post-project evaluation, especially when a common funding agency is involved.||Arindam Banik,Pradip K. Bhaumik

The difference is that the first set of problems are intra-sectoral while the second is inter-sectoral. This paper attempts to study the environmental impact of water pollution on rural communities in general and on agricultural production, human health, and livestock in particular. Some important issues in this regard are (a) linkages between industrial development and changes in the micro (local) environment; (b) damage to crops and animal husbandry due to industrial pollution; and (c) impact on health and sanitation in rural communities. These issues are studied in detail with the help of primary data collected from a pollution-affected village in Andhra Pradesh.||Bhagirath Behera,V. Ratna Reddy
