It discusses the discrepancies discovered between official figures and the study report, especially in the neonatal mortality rates. It also looks at the causes of child deaths reported by the study through its 'social audit', which seeks to trigger social and political forces to embark on corrective administrative action to improve reporting and reduce child mortality in Maharashtra.||Abhay Bang,M.

The report not only tramples upon the sovereign rights of states to have their own environmental protection regimes, but also goes a long way to legitimise green protectionism. It further raises the issue of the place and function of the dispute settlement system in the WTO scheme of things. Unless important third world countries like India act to prevent the dispute settlement machinery from assuming an extraconstitutional role, their trade and development cause would suffer irredeemable damage.||B.

Theories and paradigms from the west may prove completely alienated from actual experiences of women at the grassroots. This criticism has often taken on an anti-west culture bashing, a growing tendency to question the 'Indian-ness' of the women's movement here or has led to ineffectual attempts to develop an alternative perspective based wholly on indigenous categories of thought. This paper is an attempt to analyse the presuppositions that define the need for a 'grassroots feminist theory'.||U. Kalpagam

As it stands the draft policy is riddled with contradictions and confusions. It spells a significant departure from the 1983 policy objectives of providing primary health care for all, specially the underprivileged. Instead of creatively utilising private sector to provide basic affordable health care, it all but hands over the task to the private sector, inevitably undermining existing national health programmes. By encouraging the corporate involvement in tertiary and secondary level medical care without first ensuring their access to the underprivileged, the draft denies the rights of the poor to good care.||Imrana Qadeer

The resulting isolation and their disengagement from the social and political processes damaged the country's academic institutions, public places and the social and physical environment.

Also, Atre must be considered the first author, after Jotirao Phule, to attempt to make the educated urbanite aware of the problems of the farmer by way of a full-length book. The core theme of Atre's book is the disastrous social and moral consequences of a medieval socio-economic system and mindset lingering on into the early decades of the 20th century. This moral degeneration, according to Atre, is the progeny of the vatan system and his book is an invocation to get rid of the vatan system and the hold of the vatan mentality induced by it and to embrace the modern economic order of the market.||S.

A considerable proportion of these expenditures is undertaken by the states but the central share seems to be increasing over time. This paper analyses trends in state expenditure, expenditure by the central government and central and state adjusted combined expenditures. Overall, expenditure on social sector schemes is increasing in real terms but mainly through increased expenditure of the central government. The state governments seem to be easing out of their constitutional commitment to sustain programmes in the social sectors, which is a matter of concern. Secondly, there are large inter-sectoral reallocations of funds in the poverty alleviation sectors. One major development has been that large funds that were allocated to employment generation have now been diverted to the rural road construction programme. This reallocation may have serious implications for employment generation.||Abusaleh Shariff,Prabir Ghosh,S. K. Mondal

Using an asymmetric vector autoregressive model, we found that in the deregulated financial regime, the fiscal deficit did not create a rise in the interest rate. Rather, the causality runs from the ex ante real rate of interest to fiscal deficit. This result is in conformity with the recent trend in Indian public finance where the high interest rate fuelled the accumulation of more debt through increase in interest payments and the consequent debt-deficit spiral.||Lekha S.

While the Task Force recognises that software and hardware are the two sides of a gold coin, its report is oblivious to the mechanism that would establish an interdependent growth path for the IT industry of India. It has been argued in this paper that the weakness of the Indian software industry continues because of its weak linkages with the domestic manufacturing industry where rests the scope of critical software capability - the high skill/high risk/high value embedded software segment that can flourish only with wide applications of microelectronics in the industrial products and processes. This is the segment that offers the opportunity for interdependent growth of both hardware and software sectors of the Indian IT industry. The structure of Indian IT industry that supports low value/low skill products and services is not strong enough to enter the high investment high R and D area of the embedded software segment without a strong strategic push.||Pradosh Nath,Amitava Hazra

Over the past quarter century a number of 'participatory' methods have been developed to supplement conventional democratic processes by moving beyond traditional forms of consultation. Increasingly, the introduction of new technologies and all policy processes involves making decisions without being able to predict the effects of different courses of action. Participatory methods can be invaluable in such situations.

This paper seeks to examine how two vernacular newspapers - Ananda Bazar Patrika, a privately owned newspaper with the largest circulation in West Bengal and Ganashakti, owned and controlled by the Communist Party of India-Marxist, which has ruled in West Bengal since 1977 - contributed to 'reformulating' the public sphere during the Kargil 'war', from late May to July 1999.||Dipankar Sinha

This episteme continues to govern contemporary attempts to modernise the system, as is illustrated by the recently announced comprehensive policy on indigenous systems, the first of its kind since independence.||Madhulika Banerjee

Its purpose is to find out if there is any threshold level of female literacy associated with a rapid decline in the size of the under-6 population. The analysis is done separately for three social groups; the tribals, the scheduled castes and the rest or the 'general' population. The results have an important bearing on policy while processes behind these are of considerable significance to researchers. Further validation of these patterns using 2001 Census data and similar analysis for states is indicated.||Satish B. Agnihotri

This has often yielded a more objective account. This part - on Prices, is different. There is the government resolution on the enquiry into prices, and the views of a government statistician and a few economists of some repute, down to 2001; two of them just did not confront the problem. They also stumbled, strangely, on the basic promises of the new standard, and on the unique structure and management of India's external accounts when this has long ceased to be a mystique.

The story of Meera Bai presents in a way the most flagrant violation of this Rajput notion of dishonour. This essay probes at the contradictions that Meera Bai embodies. Hers was a rebellion against conventional restrictive norms that sought to regulate and control women's lives, and Meera was condemned by feudal society for such acts of deviation, yet Meera still remains honoured and revered and till date survives in the cultural consciousness of the people.||Pratibha Jain,Sangeeta Sharma

Cuckold by Kiran Nagarkar is however not merely a narration of events and experiences in the life of Maharaj Kumar, heir to the throne of Mewar. Nagarkar conceives him as a political character to serve as an effective foil to the milieu of feudal India, with all its possibilities and problems; his attitude towards the military and other matters are highlighted to deliberately counter prevailing feudal norms. Nagarkar skilfully reconstructs Maharaj Kumar's military experiments to critically examine the military mentality of feudal Mewar.||Anirudh Deshpande

The directions now being taken reverse earlier tendencies on the part of American Muslim political organisations to narrow the boundaries of the community and to emphasise foreign policy issues at the expense of domestic ones. These new directions, however, broaden the boundaries of American Islam in other ways, drawing more widely on the religion's rich, long-standing traditions of humanistic and legal scholarship. Importantly also, the directions now being taken are being strongly shaped by non-Muslim politicians and the media in the US, in an interaction between American Muslims and the state that is, perhaps paradoxically, drawing Muslims more closely into national political life.||Karen Leonard

Its relative silence on caste-based cultural forms or forms that contested caste is surprising, since several of these forms had contested the claims of national culture and national identity. While these caste-based cultural practices with their roots in the social and material conditions of the dalits and bahujans have long been marginalised by bourgeois forms of art and entertainment, the category of the popular lives on and continues to relate to everyday lives, struggles and labour of different classes, castes and gender. This paper looks at caste-based forms of cultural labour such as the lavani and the powada as grounds on which cultural and political struggles are worked out and argue that struggles over cultural meanings are inseparable from struggles of survival.||Sharmila Rege

While the ability to repay can be captured by economic factors like the growth rate of the economy and external shocks, willingness to repay is more difficult to measure. In this paper, it is emphasised that political factors are important determinants of the willingness to repay and should be treated as an explanatory variable explicitly. A multivariate probit model is estimated that tests the hypothesis that the probability of default is inversely related to the level of democracy in the debtor country. It is shown that the evidence doesn't support the hypothesis.||Sujata Verma

The firms are classified by the dividend pay-out ratio into high-cost and low-cost groups; a high dividend pay-out ratio implies a low cost of information faced by the firms and vice versa. In the context of developed countries, earlier researchers found that the firms in the high-cost group shows evidence of finance constraints and severity of the constraint goes down with the decrease in the cost of information. In our study we found that the firms with medium dividend pay-out ratios are constrained in the loans market so far as investment in fixed capital is concerned. This is quite a surprising result that requires careful explanation.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi,Pranab Kumar Das,Bhaswar Moitra

The eight crops are paddy, wheat, groundnut, rape/mustardseed, sugarcane, cotton, potato and onion. Clearly, any reconfiguration of input subsidies presently available to agriculture will alter the taxable surplus parameters and levy rates estimated, but the method used is of perfectly general applicability. The state-level rates of levy calculated for the year 1996-97 yield an estimated tax revenue of Rs 500 crore, around 80 per cent of aggregate land revenue collected that year from agricultural land. The levy is envisaged for panchayat rather than state-level, with jurisdictional retention for infrastructure improvements within agriculture. District-level rates of levy, with taxable surplus parameters adjusted for crop yield variations across districts, are calculated for four selected states: Andhra, Punjab, Rajasthan and West Bengal. Revenue additionality at panchayat level as a per cent of own revenue collections, aggregating across all panchayat tiers, ranges between 30 per cent in Andhra, and 201 per cent for West Bengal.||Indira Rajaraman,Nilabja Ghosh

Success of tax reform efforts depends on their implementation as an integral package.||Madhav Godbole

In the Eighties there was a fundamental transformation in the mass character of the party: on the heels of the VHP's test runs with emotive symbols the party cashed in to reap a rich harvest of votes. When these proved inadequate to reach power without back-pedalling the core issues, a compromise was arrived at. The issues were deferred but never renounced. They were put on the shelf, ready to be activated when the time was ripe. Such a time had clearly arrived by mid-March 2002 for a variety of reasons.||Mahesh Rangarajan

This article contends that this 'contempt for religion' was marginalised in the course of the secularism debates in the Constituent Assembly. The dominant position on secularism that a 'democratic' Constitution find place for religion as a way of life for most Indians triumphed over those who wished for the Assembly to grant only a narrow right to religious freedom, or to make the uniform civil code a fundamental right. These early discussions on religious freedom also highlight a paradox - it is precisely some of the advocates of a broad right to religious freedom who were also the most vociferous opponents of any political rights for religious minorities.||Shefali Jha

However, the size and even the direction of the flow of surpluses have been obscured by the usual methods of calculating the value of foreign trade from the mercantilist era down to the present. The author's recalculation of the surplus extracted by Britain from India and Burma demystifies the astonishment expressed by most commentators about the very large proportion British foreign investment formed of its GDP and the apparently perverse desire of the British to retain an empire which was less profitable than, say, investment in the USA. The realisation of the enormous surplus was an integral part of the mechanism by which the white-settled colonies were populated and equipped and therefore could not be treated as a substitute for that process.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

This paper, an attempt to examine the extent of women's involvement in forestry and their role in JFM in West Bengal, observes that despite women's greater involvement in forestry, the state JFM resolution has proved inadequate for ensuring their participation in community institutions.||Debnarayan Sarker,Nimai Das

As this paper argues, the brahminic theory of a varna social structure based on the notions of purity and pollution is systematically mapped on to the framework of the trophic system as developed in the field of ecology. The evolution of castes follow the logic of Darwinian principles elaborated in the field of population ecology. The emergence of untouchability is seen as an ecologically determined adaptation contributing to the fitness and survival of those regarded as untouchable. Untouchability and the varna framework are inseparably joined by an ecological logic. It is not possible to preserve in any way the identities of caste and at the same time hope to eradicate untouchability.||Purnendu S. Kavoori

An important step was taken in this behalf in 1998 by enactment of a legislation for the setting up of the electricity regulatory commissions (ERCs) at the centre and in the states. But the experience of the functioning of the ERCs so far is far from satisfactory. It is now imperative that ERCs take a strong position and refuse to entertain the submissions of SEBs and licensees for tariff revisions till their reasonable directives are complied with. It is time the ERCs made full use of the penal powers available under the concerned legislation. For what is at stake is not only the viability and the future of the power sector but also the credibility of the ERCs.||Madhav Godbole

Since statistics are generated as by-products of administration, the system is the most economical and suitable for our vast country. However, over the last decade, the system of administrative statistics has been deteriorating at its very first stage of data collection due to ebbing efficiency of government administration at all levels, and has almost collapsed in certain important sectors. Since, for the most part, the state governments are responsible for the system, the remedy for its failure lies in exhorting and assisting the state governments to stem its deterioration and bring it back on tracks. The department of statistics (DoS) of government of India, however, viewed the situation differently, and under the pressure of meeting the requirements of Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) of the IMF, engaged itself in a flurry of initiatives since 1998. The DoS perceived the lack of coordination and of modernisation as the major causes of the system's failures. It, therefore, attempted to create an institution endowed with regulatory powers in the field of statistics, and formulate, with World Bank assistance, a project to modernise the ISS. This paper, organised in three parts, attempts to analyse these initiatives, and to highlight their grave implications for the ISS. In this part, the paper gives the background of the development of the ISS, describes the problems it faces at present, and the approach to their resolution suggested by the National Statistical Commission. It discusses the vital issue of desirability of the decentralised structure of the ISS, and points to the adoption of certain modernisation measures that reinforce the emerging tendency to centralisation. Beginning the discussion of its main theme, the paper then critically examines the formal assessment of deficiencies of the ISS made by DoS's secretary, which formed the starting point of DoS's initiatives, and analyses the DoS's proposal for creation of the Statistical Authority in India.||S.

Excess female mortality in India has been attributed to the poor economic returns women generate in the labour market, as well as certain inherent cultural and religious beliefs, which prejudice female survival chances greater than those of males. The authors argue that it is this cultural and religious fabric in India that influences the way in which uncertainty about the outcome of investing in boys or girls is perceived. The result may be an over-reaction - in terms of investment - to positive information about male prospects, and vice versa, an under-reaction to positive information about female prospects, thereby exacerbating the survival differential between males and females. Policy-makers should not only increase the opportunities for females to contribute economically, but they should ensure that these policies are long-term in nature - and not politically motivated - and are well communicated.||Paul H.

High levels of party competition have long been effective in reducing violence for this reason in southern states such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala. The rise elsewhere in India of parties such as the BSP and SP also creates intense competition for Muslim votes, which in turn leads to politicians promising - and delivering - greater security for minorities.||Steven I.

Ecologists had been accustomed to taking money from any funding source and attempting to do their own work while also fulfilling grant requirements. In doing so they often implicitly supported institutions or policies that they might not have actually supported. The now controversial Bharatpur bird-banding project, in the late 1960s, the first large-scale study of bird migration in India, receiving funds as it did from the US Army is a case in point.

This paper analyses how the city, its physical and socio-economic structure, responded to the needs of globalisation. The increasingly uncertain economic base of the city left self-employed and casual workers vulnerable to the vagaries of market forces. In the vacuum created by the exclusion of certain sections of the city's population from development programmes and as local governments abstained from their welfare responsibilities, an opportunity was created for the Sangh parivar to step in with its vicious propaganda, fomenting hatred and creating an identifiable, though false, image of the 'other'.||Darshini Mahadevia

The entire oeuvre of practice, both discursive and material - the imagery of Bharat mata, the valiant historical figures and subservient mythical wives - all allow women to become avenging angels in moments of crisis.

The authors have looked into the nature of relationship between the daily share price in BSE and NSE on the one hand and Nasdaq and New York Stock Exchange on the other, for 1999-2000 through 2000-2001 and have found a unidirectional causality from Nasdaq to BSE or NSE. The relationship as well as direction of causation also holds good for the technology segment of the New York Stock Exchange and BSE or NSE. However, domestic prices of technology stocks and overall domestic share prices were found to be independent of each other.||Sanjay K. Hansda,Partha Ray

A simple decomposition analysis of growth in assets portfolio as well as a model based analysis of credit growth for the Indian public sector banks corroborated that (a) in the post reform period, public sector banks did shift their portfolio in a way that reduce their capital requirements and (b) adoption of stricter risk management practice in respect of bank lending in the post reform period and its interplay with minimum capital requirements (regulatory pressure) have had a dampening effect on the overall credit supply.||Ashok K.

The Sangh parivar, for all its rhetoric on upliftment of the dalits, hardly ever raises a voice against caste-based discrimination or atrocities against dalits.

While norms for national accounts and macro data systems are set by the Planning Commission, the need for information based on local understanding has gained further urgency with the setting up of District Planning Committees in all states.

The 2001 Census, however, gives a clear indication that India is passing through the last phase of fertility transition, moving towards moderate to low fertility. Fertility declines have not, however, been uniform across the country and the differential rates are mainly responsible for the differentials in population growth rates across states and union territories.||Christophe Z.

This article looks at the micro sector - the world of the unorganised woman worker and analyses the varied impact that liberalisation and globalisation has had on her working conditions. A decline in employment opportunities has seen a simultaneous 'casualisation' and growing 'feminisation' of the workforce - with concomitant ills of low wages and declining job security.||Renana Jhabvala,Shalini Sinha

In this concluding part, evidence is presented to show that the fall in the adult sex ratio was mainly because of the control of famines that used to take heavy toll of older men. The accelerated fall in the child sex ratio after 1981 seems to be largely due to the diffusion of prenatal sex selection techniques in regions with well-entrenched gender bias. Although the declines were marginal, it is not entirely clear why the child sex ratio declined during 1951-81. It could be because of the expansion of medical services in rural areas that brought the gender bias in provision of health care to the fore, or from a century-long trend of falling female-male ratio at birth as a result of improvements in nutritional status and midwifery practices.||P.

The indigenous populations within the Shoolpaneshwar Wildlife Sanctuary who have traditionally had access to its resources now regard its construction as a means of curtailing their right of access to forest resources and for appropriating land previously used by them for cultivation. Their struggle in turn, has involved the reconstruction of their environmental and social history that is an attempt to assert the validity of the local sense of place over more abstract conceptions of space, imposed on them from above. Their oral reconstruction of history, kinship and identity is actually a response to the threat of dislocation, in which a concept of space without people has taken precedence over local interactions with, and interpretations of, the environment.||Judy Whitehead

Most of the progressive trends in social activism today can be traced indirectly to the issues raised by or associated with the Naxalite movement in 1960s. But the disquieting trends in the movement today are actually manifestations of a deeper ideological crisis that has overtaken the old strategy and tactics of the leadership. What was appropriate in Maoist China in the 1930s cannot be replicated in the India of the 21st century. The crucial condition for the survival of the Naxalites is a new broad-based socialist movement with new organisational strategies, which would carry them forward into a wider political arena.||Sumanta Banerjee

Curzon's unusual despatch of 1900 began it, permitting free sale of council bills, ostensibly for 'convenience of trade' (words the Chamberlain Commission wished to bury); really to get funds in London faster than accumulating coinage profits. We apprehend that with London's financial market recently internationalised, the India Office-Exchange Banks' tie-up gave them added power over disposition of India's exchange earnings. The Commission justified hurried transfer of large funds to London, for its 'present and prospective ends', using every possible means, some we reveal. All this impinged on a weak economy, precipitating ominous rise of prices, attracting notice of all, the viceroy included, and endangering the welfare of many millions, and perhaps storing up difficulties for the future.

Even as extraordinary violence was perpetrated on Indian women, it was women's bodies that provided the necessary domain for the assertion of competitive party politics - a fact reflected in the arguments and counter-arguments offered during the debate. As this essay suggests, the ominous final message that seeps through is that constitutional governance can achieve little except normalise violence, almost as a social cost of democratic politics, in which even structured practices of governance are established that deny as well silence women's sufferings. The task for the 'active citizen' thus is to frame imaginative patterns of social action that would not merely empower victims but also adequately present the voices of suffering, giving voice to the anguish - a task that could effectively challenge the newly instituted narratives of 'pride' and 'honour'.||Upendra Baxi

The paper in this part analyses the contents of the project and the philosophy, strategies and approach that shaped it, and brings out its serious implications for the Indian statistical system (ISS). The project is formulated with the short-term objective of meeting the requirements of Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) of the IMF and for monitoring poverty. By design it does not address the problems and development of the ISS. Instead, it established the NSSs as an alternative system to ISS, and aims for a massive expansion of the NSSO and modernise its operations. The project covers only marginally the modernisation of other sub-systems, and where it does so it does not address the vital problem of collection of data and their quality. It requires the government of India to adopt measures that will centralise the statistical system of the country. The paper shows that the project, driven not by national needs but by international demands for data, and based on unjustified NSSO expansion, will lead to the neglect of ISS. The paper ends with broad suggestions for reformulation of the project, and a call to state governments to set their statistical house in order and to beware of the emerging tendencies to centralise the ISS.||S.

West Bengal is the first and the only major state to have had timely panchayat elections on a party basis regularly every five years since 1978. However, despite its pioneering status in terms of reforms of the panchayat system, West Bengal lags behind several other states today in terms of devolution of power, finances and functions to the panchayat. Also, the extent of people's participation in the planning process is significantly less compared to that in Kerala. This paper studies a particular component of a set of recently introduced reforms of the panchayat system in West Bengal that is aimed precisely at addressing this concern - the introduction of mandatory village constituency (gram sansad) meetings.||Maitreesh Ghatak,Maitreya Ghatak

'Privatisation' of government services by its employees and government's monopoly of power are the real problems today. The new paradigm must be based on a clear and non-ideological recognition of the strengths and the weakness of the state and the people. A democratic society has enormous potential for entrepreneurship, innovation and creative development. The people, their diverse forms of activity and association such as companies, cooperatives, societies, trusts and other NGOs must be allowed and encouraged to play their due role. The state must focus on what only it can do best and shed all activities that the people can do as well or better. The heavy hand of government in the form of incentive-distorting laws, rules, regulations, procedures and red tape have also corrupted industry and business and other organised interest groups. These must be removed so as to release the energy of the people. The state should confine itself to managing the economy so as to accelerate employment and income growth in a self-sustaining manner, ensure that all citizens receive their basic entitlements of basic public goods and services and empower the poor so that they have equal rights (and responsibilities) with the better off citizens.||Arvind Virmani

It started with selling of minority shares in 1991-92 and continues today with emphasis on strategic sale. The implementation of the present policy has shown the tremendous benefits of privatisation to the taxpayers, the economy, the stock-market and employees.

The number of detainees is reported by official sources to be less than 500, and by non-official sources as about 1,500. These are very small numbers considering that 35,000 people have been arrested since January 1990 (official figure). When I pointed this out to someone, the answer seemed pretty obvious to him. He asked "how can the number of detainees increase if instead of being detained, people are deliberately killed?" In the context of Kashmir, if this is the only choice, detention, for all its abuses, seems positively benign. Indeed it could be argued that in Kashmir the immediate task of human rights groups should be to focus attention on preventing custodial deaths, even if in the short term this means accepting greater use of detention.||Prabhu Ghate

Due to ethnic mobilisation, parties confined to their narrow sectarian bases have been unable to aggregate public opinion, obtain majority support and form stable governments. This has led to short-lived coalitions, which have not been able to formulate long-term policies that can address the felt needs of the people contributing in turn to the breakdown of governance and instability. Fiscal indiscipline by governments has also pushed the state into a debt trap and serious economic decline, which is responsible for the disillusionment among the electorate witnessed in the recent elections. These negative features have developed since the late 1980s. The paper concludes that reform of parties is an urgent necessity without which the prospects of a functioning party system, effective governance and political stability remain dim.||Sudha Pai

For a variety of reasons, many of them in the realm of political economy, the government has been unable to reduce its expenditures and increase revenues. A fiscal responsibility bill, of the kind being discussed currently, is meant to offer a credible commitment that the government is serious about fiscal consolidation. By tying its own hands the government signals that it is serious about reducing deficits. While one may disagree with the details of the bill, the broad overall thrust and the philosophy underlying it deserve to be welcomed. Unfortunately, as this note is being written, the government is seen to be completely diluting the provisions of the bill so as to render it completely ineffective.||Ajit Karnik

Their strength in the capital city, and marginal significance elsewhere in the state, made them convenient pawns in the games politicians played. As a result a Muslim leadership arose whose concern was that they alone should be able to move this pawn. Meanwhile, a Cyberabad, based on English, was being developed for modern young persons. Young Muslim boys and girls of the Old City were eager to have English education so that they could get good jobs. The wheel had come full circle.

On the other hand, individual acquisitiveness in the context of socialised production has resulted in encompassing inequalities, yet this has been the driving force for change. Karl Marx envisaged an alternative in the abolition of private property and complete socialisation of production and distribution of wealth, he also visualised technology increasingly displacing human labour in the process of economic production. While his latter vision is coming true in some measure, the substitution of the denial of the self for society as motor for production has proved a disaster.

But these developments have begun to level out. At the same time the state has fallen behind in other sectors - industry, higher education and state of public finances, particularly - to an extent that is seriously worrying. This paper reviews performance of these different sectors, discusses possible explanatory factors, and makes a number of suggestions for policy reforms. With regard to industrial revival, it stresses public investment in transport and communication, measures to improve higher education, foster industry-university collaborations, and help small-scale industries overcome specific market imperfections (access to credit, technology and distribution channels). In public finance, emphasis is placed on raising tax revenues (especially with regard to the service sector), limiting losses of public sector undertakings, and widening the scope of land taxes and user fees. In the agricultural sector, the need for a greater role of the government with regard to biotechnology, extension services, irrigation and flood control is emphasised, along with suggestions for encouraging and regulating contract farming with MNCs. Finally the article urges greater empowerment of panchayats with regard to social service delivery and agro-business development, and administrative reforms to enhance accountability of state government employees.||Abhijit Banerjee,Pranab Bardhan,Kaushik Basu,Mrinal Datta Chaudhuri,Maitreesh Ghatak,Ashok Sanjay Guha,Mukul Majumdar,Dilip Mookherjee,Debraj Ray

The capital/nature relationship, however, is a complex one, influenced by several social and environmental factors, including modes of social relations and various forms of property. This paper attempts to illustrate this argument by analysing a specific historical situation - an inquiry into experiments with flood control in the delta regions of eastern India over 150 years. This region was transformed over this period from a flood dependent agrarian regime to a flood vulnerable landscape - a transformation effected by British colonial rule that not only instituted a new regime of property but also oversaw the deployment of numerous technical interventions. This colonial attempt to synchronise the hydraulic environment with its administrative needs and to subordinate the region to capitalist relations offers an example in which to map the basic dynamics between capital and nature and thereby enable us to address the question raised at the outset - how capital transforms nature.||Rohan D'Souza

But while the impact of social changes on people remains little documented and rests on extrapolation, this period is also assessed in terms of backward and forward linkages - those societal changes that existed before the CPI's election victory as well as changes brought on by the government's own reform measures that in turn led to further political and social development.||G.

In 1960 it was the fourth largest lake in the world; today it is on the verge of deteriorating into a small and dirty waterhole.

However, the idea of development itself has changed significantly over the years, and ODA has increasingly come to incorporate the human right approach to development. Developing countries can draw up a basic framework incorporating the requirements of growth without violating other rights, and industrial countries can then raise the funds needed for development assistance. The human rights approach has the advantage of the recognition that the rights are universal and the responsibility of fulfilling those rights is also universal.||Arjun Sengupta

A study of social science research in south Asia finds, however, that the story is not quite so simple. Not all regions, institutions or disciplines share a sense of decline or crisis. In some countries such as Nepal, for instance, this is partly because the foundations of serious social science research have not been adequately created; and in Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Pakistan and some regions of India, existing institutions have declined because of the cumulative impact of the political circumstances in which they had to operate, the shortage in the assured government funding of established institutions and other factors.||Partha Chatterjee

In the first part, some clues to the puzzle are unearthed by identifying the age groups, regions and social groups of the estimated 21 million females gone 'missing' between 1901 and 1991. In particular, it is shown that overtime there has been a convergence of the sex ratios of adults and children, and female-male ratios declined in regions and social groups where the adult sex ratios were substantially higher than the child sex ratios. In the first half of the last century, the overall sex ratio declined because of the decline at adult ages, especially at age 40 and over. After independence, the decline has been more concentrated at ages under 15. However, census data should be interpreted with caution because improving quality of age data on children can produce a spurious trend of falling sex ratios at certain childhood ages. In the light of these disclosures, the second part of the paper reviews the plausible explanations for the long-term trend of falling female-male ratio in India.||P. N. Mari Bhat

Given the small size of the committee, the large number of its terms of reference, and the short time given to it, the committee did a remarkable job. However, it did not provide the rationale for most of its large number of recommendations. The paper mainly discusses the recommendations that involve systemic and policy issues, such as the one on the status, role, and composition of the governing council of the NSSO. In particular, it extensively analyses the committee's recommendation for the massive expansion of the NSSs to meet the new data needs of the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) of the IMF and for monitoring the rapid socio-economic changes due to the new economic policy.

The 1999 Telecom Policy, the Internet Policy of 1998, and the recent legal and regulatory initiatives to overhaul the legal and regulatory regime are all steps in a positive direction.

21/12/2002-27/12/2002||special articles||4412988||Vision of the Kelkar Papers: A Critique||The approach of the Kelkar Task Forces on direct and indirect taxes suffers from certain basic deficiencies for which the consultation papers put out by them have come under flak from large sections of the taxpaying public. The deficiencies are twofold: (1) lack of a strategy to secure majority support, and (2) absence of a sound conceptual framework. In a way the two are interrelated; failure to visualise a strategy stems partly from the weaknesses of the conceptual foundations of the proposed reforms. This essay seeks to explore the sources and nature of these deficiencies. Since the proposals relating to direct taxes have attracted most attention, the discussion here is confined mainly to the direct taxes paper, especially the structural reform proposals, though some observations are made on the proposals for reform of indirect taxes and the administrative system as well.||Amaresh Bagchi

Though some aspects of caste in Punjab have been studied, there has virtually been no detailed empirical documentation of the practice of untouchability in rural Punjab. Based on an extensive field-study, this paper provides a broad mapping of the prevailing caste relations and the practice of untouchability in rural Punjab. The study focuses specifically on the process of change, particularly in the context of agrarian transformations that the Punjab countryside has experienced in the wake of the success of green revolution technology. The paper also argues that the processes of change could be meaningfully captured through the categories of 'dissociation', 'distancing' and 'autonomy'.||Surinder S. Jodhka

In the 19th century, Indian elites in general began to reformulate caste and religious identities and articulate regional identity and Indian nationalism by appropriating and modifying certain ideas and idioms introduced under British rule and others existing in the local society.

India is a bank-based system that in the organised sector till recently followed the internal strategy of managing employment. But as product markets are liberalised and firms face increased competition, the ability to pass on the costs of worker privileges such as job security diminishes depending on the state of capital markets. The new epoch of competition based on the use of more flexible technologies and forms of work organisation thus calls for job enlargement and multiskilling and in some cases rearranging employees rather than recomposing the tasks they perform.||Errol D'Souza

Unfortunately there is a growing trend among some sections in India to give a Pakistan-type ideological orientation to India's nationhood. But the tendency to purify Indian culture from 'alien' accretions poses a threat to the security of the country by weakening national unity and the unique civilisational experiment that is India.||Balraj Puri

Evasion of excise duty is the basis of competitive advantage in the domestic textile industry, and this has driven the better units in the organised sector away from the domestic market into exports. But exporting units are vulnerable if they are deprived of access to the domestic market. It may be too late for government to untangle the knots it has created, but at least the 2002-03 budget proposals are a step in the right direction.||S. Ganesh

30/11/2002-06/12/2002||special articles||4412901||Deposit Insurance for Cooperative Banks: Is There a Road Ahead?||This paper argues that cooperative banks face higher risk of failure than commercial banks, due to softer regulatory and supervisory arrangements, highly impaired capital and asset structure, inadequate corporate governance and lack of professionalism. Yet, these two sets of banks have been clubbed together in the same rights and capacity under a unified deposit insurance scheme. The Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation is making huge payments on account of failure of cooperative banks and this is threatening the viability of the deposit insurance system and thereby financial stability of the country. Though there are numerous problems in extending deposit insurance cover to cooperative banks even under a separate scheme, still there may be compulsions to do so. For the viability and effectiveness of the deposit insurance system for cooperative banks, it is essential that the deposit insurance system be set up within a prudential framework. However, such an arrangement may entail significant increase in the deposit insurance premium payable by cooperative banks.||Sujan Hajra

This, coupled with the fact that technological advances have thus far remained largely under the purview of the private sector gives rise to the question of the government's role and the space for public sector in agricultural R and D. There has also been a simultaneous focus on the increasing role of knowledge in agricultural production and the growing challenge of environment management in particular. What is critical is also the development of the necessary cohesion between broad developmental objectives and R and D endeavours that plays a far more significant role in frontier technologies especially biotechnology than in case of any of the traditional technologies.||Sachin Chaturvedi

Further, despite the rhetoric of socialism that accompanied that framework under Nehru, both the practice in India and the development theory that justified it were fundamentally conservative. The conservative elements in the developmentalist framework comprised an ideology of state-exaltation arising out of a 'fear of disorder' or an orientation towards the elimination of 'the causes of unrest'. So implicated were political scientists in the developmentalist goals of India's elites that they failed to provide an independent basis for critique that has become increasingly necessary as it has become more and more obvious that those goals have failed to transform India into the modern, industrial state of its elite's imaginings, have failed at the same time to provide for the basic minimum needs of its people, have failed to eliminate 'the causes of unrest' and have instead drawn the country into the ugly morass of state terrorism in the north-east, Punjab and Kashmir and have failed to provide a basis for accommodation between the Hindu and Muslim populations of the country.||Paul R.

In case of Tirthahalli, a high literacy taluk in Shimoga, Karnataka, it is found that community provides not merely physical and human facilities, but also exerts pressure on the teachers to achieve higher quality of education. Therefore, it is not just sufficient for a community to have trust, networks and norms to form social capital, rather it needs an ability to visualise the importance of education and translate it into action for achieving a higher quality of education. In Shimoga this has resulted in community pressure on teachers to achieve higher quality of education. The reasons for the high levels of community pressure can be traced back to the participation of people in various spheres of activities such as intellectual, political and apolitical movements in the region, since times past.||N.

This widening of subject matter has caused Indian judicial activism to be celebrated as a device of engineering social change. We propose an examination of judicial activism using the positive tools of economic analysis. The singular value of such an analysis lies in placing judicial activism in relation to the norm of economic efficiency. This enables a discussion in which one does not present the problem as one of contesting ideologies, but in terms of the impact of judicial activism on the allocation of resources. In the first section of the paper we outline the tools for the analysis. We establish a link between the doctrine of separation of powers and the notion of transaction costs and use this to define activism. In the second part we use the definition to perform a heuristic economic analysis of judicial activism. Our conclusions are mixed: while we see some virtue in what we call interpretational judicial activism, other forms of judicial activism that encroach on legislative or executive decision-making on grounds of privilege can result in social costs that outstrip benefits.||T.

Under capitalism, labour, like other factors, too is converted to a commodity - 'surplus labour' with exchange value; while production is not bound by limited needs or needs that limit it. Thus, the more capitalism develops, the more it is compelled to produce on a scale which has little to do with immediate demands but depends instead on a continuous enlargement of the world market - leading to 'capital's globalisation'. Yet, even as capitalism seeks to enlarge itself, it creates its own grave diggers - the proletariat who finally revolt against the system.||Paresh Chattopadhyay

The aim of the study was to assess the relative importance of these factors on the schooling choices made for girl children. The results indicated that some of the strongest enabling factors with regard to girls' school participation and grade attainment were household resource factors such as parental, especially maternal schooling, father's occupation, and family income. Urban residence, as expected, had a strong positive association, and significant cohort effects were observed with regard to the schooling outcomes. A girl child's labour force participation significantly reduced the demand for schooling, and the amount of schooling obtained. Religion and caste factors emerged as important determinants of schooling, as well.||Piyali Sengupta,Jaba Guha

At the same time, as relations between individuals are mediated more through markets and media, they also generate new kinds of rights and new capacities for imagination along with new ideas of belonging or inclusion that in turn, lead to novel ways of exercising citizenship rights and conceiving politics. This experience of inclusion in new circuits of communication and of sharing intellectual property across classes, such as seen with television, can help to politicise those sections previously marginalised. This paper, examines the implications of this argument in terms of recent debates over the rights of the hawker, or the 'pheriwala', in Mumbai.||Arvind Rajagopal

While there may not be an overall coalition in favour of compulsory land redistribution, particularly given the continuing, though diminishing, role of rural landlords as controlling vote banks in an election system, there is nonetheless a substantial opinion that something needs to be done about the inequities of existing landownership in these regions. Is it possible to work out a land reform programme in this political climate? This note looks at some of the issues involved and suggests a possible way to break the deadlock.||D. N.
23/2/2002-01/3/2002||review of industry and management||4411774||Political Lobbying and Fiscal Federalism: Case of Industrial Licences and Letters of Intent||In a quasi-federal democracy like India, political representatives often fight to attract central disbursements towards their own states. Among central disbursements, two most important ones are letters of intent and industrial licences. Much of the disparities in the economic growth of various states is attributable to variations in the development of industries and the latter, in turn, are largely contingent on the nature of the industrial policies that were followed. In this paper the authors argue that the industrial policies pursued in the post-independence era resulted in a distorted pattern of disbursement of letters of intent and industrial licences. This remains true even after account is taken of the 'demand'-generated aspect of the disbursements. It is also shown how the presence of the same distortion in the disbursements in the so-called backward regions vitiates the very objective of balanced regional development.||Rongili Biswas,Sugata Marjit

Those, particularly NGOs committed to gender priority would like women to be brought in the 'mainstream' of irrigation management by encouraging them to participate actively in the affairs of water users' associations. The paper that seeks to examine such an approach, begins with reporting on the interaction with women groups in six villages which had different sources of water for domestic use but one common feature - they were all served by a canal. Participatory rural appraisal conducted in these villages brought out that women's priority concern was very largely for water for domestic use. These women had hardly any interest in canal waters as they were perceived to be meant for agriculture, not for meeting 'their' priority requirements. How can canals serve better the women priority needs for domestic use of water? What can women do for improving the canal management and better functioning of water users' associations.||Anil C. Shah

Are Indians ready for private health insurance? Will there be demand from all sections of society? What would consumers look for when they 'purchase' insurance to cover future health risks, a concept hitherto non-existent in India? These are some of the questions this paper attempts to answer, based on data collected in Delhi from about 500 households. The study found a wide disparity across sections on willingness to participate. The challenges for the new system would be to pool individuals across risk and economic status categories; set up a multi-tier system to meet objectives of equity and efficiency in health care delivery and for planners and regulators, to keep health insurance separate from other non-health insurance.||Indrani Gupta

Similarly, the recent outbursts of Hindu-Muslim conflict are said to be related to the decay of secularism. The author argues that the concept of secularism is fundamentally obscure, since it is founded upon an arbitrary distinction between the religious and the secular. The belief that religion should be separated from politics is a normative dogma that precedes all theoretical analysis of the Indian situation. Therefore, this concept of secularism prevents us from understanding the problems of pluralism in contemporary India, instead of helping us to solve them.||Jakob De Roover

These factors include the likely evolution of fiscal and savings-investment imbalances, financial sector performance, the role of the external sector, economic reforms and productivity, infrastructure constraints, problems in agriculture, the likely developments in labour supply and demand and governmental performance. The paper concludes that it might be reasonable to expect growth in the next five years to fluctuate in the range of 4 to 6 per cent, perhaps averaging close to 5 per cent, provided there is no major economic or financial crisis. This is much lower than the 6.7 per cent growth achieved in the Eighth Plan period and far lower than the 8 per cent mooted in the Tenth Plan.||Shankar Acharya

It addresses India's apparently contradictory position of having a pioneering role in the global population control movement and also being branded as a country of 'demographic inertia'. This puzzle is in large part due to a deep contradiction and confusion that has continued from the very beginning to inflict the policy-makers and political leadership, especially about the potential of FPP per se in reducing fertility. A tension between the felt urgency of population control and a stubborn scepticism about the effectiveness of a voluntary FPP in the context of a slow socio-economic transformation, has fed into further confusions and chaos relating to the choice of policy instruments and programme strategy. This is brought into sharper focus by the success story of Bangladesh's family planning programme. The most prominent deficiencies and mistakes of India's family planning programme are, it is argued, related largely to a typical bureaucratic (and perhaps political too) predilections, hazy perceptions about effective strategy, and relatedly a chronic mismatch between expressions of priority and actual fund allocation to FPP, which were confounded by a distinct lack of openness (until very recently) towards the experience and expertise of the international community.||Arup Maharatna

It looks at the inter relationship between agriculture, labour and market linkages in terms of skills and wages. The strong role of hired women labour in agriculture, cropping patterns and market linkages have been given a gender perspective. The impact of the employment on the intra-household power relationship has also been discussed.||K. Balasubramanian,P. Tamizoli,S. Murugakani

However, in effect it amounts mostly to continuation of existing schemes. The real snag is the lackadaisical attitude of the central and state authorities in implementing policies, as is so tellingly brought out by the progress, or lack of it, of the Special Economic Zones scheme.||Sukumar Mukhopadhyay

Small industrialisation is found to be directly related to the degree of urbanisation, and there is a clear urban concentration of small enterprises in West Bengal. Infrastructure and services are mainly confined to a small region and rural industrialisation has not been promoted. Government investment on rural infrastructure is essential to promote the rural non-agricultural sector in the backward districts.||Subrata Dutta
02/3/2002-08/3/2002||commentary||4411804||Fiscal Policy and Growth||Can fiscal policy play a key role in the revival of the economy? The problem is that this question has had to be posed in the context of deteriorating fiscal balances of the centre and the states, whose combined deficit is today slightly worse after 10 years of reform. The states' gross fiscal deficit has deteriorated significantly. It is absolutely necessary, therefore, for the centre to be seen to be fiscally prudent, which will be a signal to the states of the centre's seriousness in regard to fiscal management. A contrary signal will undermine any restraint that the centre can bring to bear on the states.||Ajit Karnik

The present article deconstructs the notion of gender sensitivity by unpacking the ideological assumptions that underlie the text of the policy.

The 'problem of the changing' behaviour of the Jarwas was articulated by outsiders - experts and others - as one driven by contradictions imposed by a changing world and the Jarwas need to preserve their own cultures.

In the past six years, however, these countries have found that several asymmetries and inequities in the agreement were not conducive to their interests.

To a scholar wanting to study India a knowledge of Urdu is of practically no importance. The concept of Urdu as primarily or even exclusively a literary language, a language of love poetry, of refinement and elegance causes much damage to the way Urdu instruction is designed. It also helps in trivialising Urdu literature, particularly ghazal and qawwali. Urdu needs to be projected as a modern language.||Christina Oesterheld

This paper attempts to look at gender differentials during two 19th century famines - the Madras famine of 1876-78 and the Punjab famine of 1896-97 - from a public health perspective.

The paper makes an attempt to examine the same in the Indian context. Using data on public sector banks (PSBs) for the period 1995-96 through 2000-2001, the paper finds capital, risk and productivity change to be intertwined, with each reinforcing and to a degree, complementing the other. The results imply that inadequately capitalised banks have lower productivity and are subject to a higher degree of regulatory pressure than adequately capitalised ones. Finally, the results lend some credence to the belief that lowering government ownership tends to improve productivity.||Abhiman Das

An approach to political calculus is developed that sets out the conditions under which broad-based reforms may be introduced by the government without electoral dangers.

For efficient land planning and optimum use, it is essential that there be clarity and certainty about title to land. In India land records are in very poor shape and there is maximum litigation in rural and urban areas about ownership. It has been estimated by reputed agencies that India loses 1.3 per cent economic growth annually as a result of disputed land titles, which inhibit supply of capital and credit for agriculture. It is therefore exceedingly important that a fundamental change is brought about in the way land records are maintained. The conversion of the present system of presumptive titles to land into conclusive titles is the only sensible solution of this problem. Bold political direction alone can bring about reform of this magnitude which will bring our country in the mainstream of a worldwide trend, enhance the marketability of land, reduce the stupendous social cost of litigation and give a boost to agricultural production and urban and industrial development.||D.

India has tried to emulate China's success story in the area of hybrid rice research and development, but Indian farmers have not readily accepted hybrid rice technology. This paper provides insights on why this has been so, based on the evaluation results of a study on farmers' experiences with hybrid rice adoption in India.||Aldas Janaiah

While this development has been welcomed by education bureaucrats, there has been little research on these schools, which often because they remained 'unrecognised' even missed statistical surveys. This paper reports a small field study of these schools in one district each in Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.||Anuradha De,Claire Noronha,Meera Samson

In 1991-92, there was also rainfall deficiency. So, was the rise in poverty on account of bad weather conditions, or due to economic reforms? The analysis in this paper reveals that rainfall deficiency by itself would not have led to the sharp rise in poverty. Government policy - not necessarily the fiscal contraction of 1991-92, was important. For the reversal in the trend of rural poverty in 1993-94 fiscal expenditure was important. However, even all these factors together leave a large part of poverty changes unexplained.||Asha Maheshwari

It is here that civil society and the local community must have the space to act and where necessary even solicit the state's intervention - a moving idea behind those protest movements seen earlier this year.

A significant methodogical feature that distinguishes the present study from previous investigations is that this analysis recognises the joint endogeneity of child labour, child schooling and child poverty. The study is conducted on Nepalese and Pakistani data, and the results are compared. A key empirical finding, with significant policy implications, is the sharp trade-off between child labour and child schooling. Another common feature of both countries is the gender bias in favour of boys' schooling, though the bias is much larger in case of Pakistan.||Ranjan Ray

Since that part of the workforce which is not captured by the NSS surveys is not likely to remain stagnant and is subject to increases and declines, depending on the specific situation, it is possible that an increase in this part of the workforce may explain the decline in the worker-population ratio (WPR) in the nineties. The workforce in these 'difficult to measure sectors', such as subsistence work, home-based work or informal work, can be better captured through time use surveys. Using data from the pilot time use survey (1998-99), this paper shows that (a) this survey technique is capable of getting more realistic estimates of workforce and (b) some of the work not captured in the NSS surveys but captured in the time use surveys is likely to explain the changes in the employment situation in the nineties to a considerable extent.||Indira Hirway

Aspects of the household such as its economic standard of living, social standing, exposure to mass media, work status were some of the influential factors at work on a couple's decision on their number of children. However, individual and household level factors have been unable in several instances to explain the full course of fertility transition seen in some Indian states and Bangladesh, where in some regions fertility transition cuts across socio-economic and cultural boundaries. Gaps in understanding such trends have been as this paper suggests due to the conventional emphasis on household level variables. It argues instead for the need to look at the influence the community plays in south Asia and to understand the levels of interaction that exist at household level and at the community level.||S.

Low buoyancy of central transfers and spillover of central pay revisions have had the most adverse impact on state finances. However, the states' own fiscal performance has also seen sharp deterioration. On the transfer system, the scheme proposed by the ministry of finance attempts to link a portion of transfers to fiscal reforms. There are serious design issues in the scheme. It is not certain whether the scheme will be effective either. The paper details the areas of reform the states should focus on to impart efficiency and improve revenue productivity and prioritisation and compression of unproductive expenditures.||M. Govinda Rao

There have been some deficiencies in the functioning of that mechanism; the amendments to the ISWD Act passed in early 2002 seek to remedy them and some further improvements are suggested here.

At this stage the BJP in Gujarat is not in a comfortable position to convince voters about its ability to provide good governance. But that is not enough. The alternative party will have to articulate and highlight vital socio-economic issues. If it fails in doing so, emotional issue will dominate and work in favour of the BJP.||Ghanshyam Shah

It becomes important then to examine this process of growing casualisation of the workforce and its links with the quickened pace of liberalisation all through the 1990s. A growing literature seeks to demonstrate the links between specific policies of liberalisation, such as deregulation of the labour market, export promotion and trade liberalisation, with the processes of casualisation, informalisation and feminisation of the labour force. In order to be able to understand these issues better, this paper seeks to examine the changes in patterns of industrial employment in light of the statistical evidence available.||Jesim Pais

It shows how the government sought to alleviate vagrancy by providing liberal funds and enacting legislation and the difficulties faced by it. The paper presents the conflict between the state and the interests of European business class in India over the responsibility of deporting the vagrants and between the legal rights of the 'European British subject' and the moral obligation of the colonial state. Also brought out is the hollowness of the missionary claim of 'the civilised Christian versus the uncouth native' and of the rhetoric of 'white man's burden'.||Aravind Ganachari

India has the military capability to defend her territorial integrity and security; however, it will have to sustain higher rates of economic growth to be able to alter the strategic balance in Asia, and globally, to her developmental advantage. Having said this, the author argues that it is not economic growth by itself that holds the key to India's global profile and power, but the nature of that growth process and the manner in which the economic challenges it faces today are addressed. The threat to what more recently has come to be defined as 'homeland security' is posed by social and economic backwardness, the inequalities and the political uncertainty this generates, and the quality of economic development.||Sanjaya Baru

In Benares with a history marked since antiquity by an uninterrupted line of sacredness, the process was more fractured and conflict-ridden with memories of Hindu-Muslim conflicts that were a frequent occurrence after the mid-17th century. Growing economic cleavages and the available political and educational opportunities increasingly fostered divisions among communities that in turn assisted in the formation of a robust, aggressive Hindu identity.

With its adoption by the ruling class and the indigenous population, Bengali marked a site that also oversaw contests for domination across a broad social spectrum. For the latter moreover, the language also defined their cultural identity, as part of the attempt to create a new literary prose Bengali to distinguish it from earlier colloquial forms. The new Bengali became an essential tool for the urban, educated upper middle classes to establish their power over lesser privileged groups - women, the lowly classes and poor Muslims. However, commercial print cultures that emanated from numerous cheap presses in Calcutta and its suburbs disseminated wide-ranging literary preferences that afforded a space to different sections of the Bengali middle classes to voice their own distinctive concerns.||Anindita Ghosh

It can be concluded that the case for privatisation of PSBs in India is not strong enough at least on the grounds usually proposed by the advocates of privatisation. Private sector banking would have a larger probability of crisis if the supporting legal and regulatory framework were not sound enough to insulate the systems from extraneous pressures. It may, therefore, be safer to maintain the public sector character of the banks till the conditions for privatisation are conducive enough.||K. B. L. Mathur

While Wood's Despatch of 1854 brought many reforms in education in India this was followed by various commissions and committees which gave a fillip to women's education. After 1956 and up to 1976 these initiatives were part of development programmes implemented with the active participation of NGOs to empower women, especially tribal women. After 1976 mass literacy campaigns, environmental and women's movements have contributed extensively to the progress of women's education.

Land reform efforts are also stymied due to a lack of political will, scarcity of land and resources. Research summarised in this article seeks to offer an innovative and alternative solution, one that involves the provision of amply-sized homestead plots. As experiments in other countries, replicated in certain districts of Karnataka have borne out, such homestead and garden plots hold out the prospect of substantial benefits to poor, rural households, offering them much more than a place to build a house.||Tim Hanstad,Jennifer Brown,Roy Prosterman

A Note||The efficiency of the public sector banks has declined during the 1990s when measured by the spread/working fund ratio. Though the turnover/employee ratio of the public sector banks improved, the ratio for the private and foreign banks doubled relative to that of the public sector banks. The profitability of the public sector banks did improve relative to the private and foreign banks, but they have lost ground in their ability to attract deposits at favourable interest rates, in their slow technological upgradation, and in their staffing and employment practices, which has implications for their longer-term profitability.||Errol D'Souza

Our analysis shows that it has not resulted in concomitant improvement in ambient air quality. One of the reasons is reliance on new vehicles, with little emphasis on in-service vehicles. The containment of vehicular pollution requires an integrated approach, with combined use of transport policies and air pollution control instruments.||Vinish Kathuria

The village was an important category where such continuity could be easily observed. However, a closer reading of some of the leading ideologues of nationalist movements also points to significant variations in their views on the substantive realities characterising rural India. Focusing primarily on writings of Gandhi, Nehru and Ambedkar, the paper attempts to show that though the village was a central category in the nationalist imaginations and there was virtual agreement that it represented the core of the traditional social order of India, the attitudes of the three leaders towards village society varied considerably. The paper tries to show that while for Gandhi the village was a site of authenticity, for Nehru it was a site of backwardness and for Ambedkar the village was the site of oppression.||Surinder S.

At least three strategic conclusions can be drawn from the Uruguay Round and Doha experiences. First, we need to consider the direct benefits to us of any demand we put forward in the negotiations. Second, diplomacy requires that we define our negotiating position positively rather than negatively. Finally, and most importantly, prior to defining our negotiating position, we must think hard about the end-game. By repeatedly staking a position that is far from what we eventually accept, as has been the case in the UR Agreement and the Doha Declaration, we lose credibility in future negotiations and risk being isolated.

To use the revenue from a currency transaction tax to augment multilateral aid flows would, in these circumstances, have the appeal of assisting countries that are largely bypassed by private international capital markets.

As NSS data for 1987-88 suggest, the magnitude of child labour in Tamil Nadu appears disturbingly large, with nearly 11 children out of every 100 in the workforce. Tragically, this very large presence of orderly, systematic child labour and child illiteracy, together with their thorough dispersal across space, has rendered the phenomenon of child labour an unremarkable, everyday occurrence. The concerns of society and the state remain limited to certain specific occupations in certain specific locations, to the neglect of other occupations and locations which merit at least equal attention.||D.

In a developing economy like India, with its tradition of successful and pervasive public intervention, it generates unique mind-blocks. Its implementation therefore requires persistent, persuasive zeal. However, the compulsions of ensuring higher levels of investment at progressively higher levels of efficiency and productivity require a complete restructuring of the economic environment. Low levels of public savings, inadequate competition and low export orientation are barriers which need to be transcended. Privatisation and liberalisation of the licensing regime for Foreign Direct Investment are two initiatives which can meet the objectives of efficiency enhancement, domestic and foreign resource mobilisation and incremental capital outlays. The pace of privatisation has quickened since 2000. The adoption of a strategy of block sale of government stock in identified PSEs to a strategic partner, along with transfer of management control, as opposed to market sale of shares in small lots, has enhanced the value received by the government through disinvestment. It also ensures that these assets are put to productive use in the most optimum time frame and with the maximum benefit. While it is too early to quantify such benefits, there is sufficient anecdotal evidence of significant welfare gains for employees, institutional investors and the economy, along with the quantifiable gains for government, from the additional resources freed by the sale of PSEs.||Pradip Baijal

The exercise is confined to 27 public sector banks, so as to investigate variations within a class that is homogeneous on the ownership dimension. The exercise groups banks with higher than average NPAs into those explained by poor operating efficiency, and those where the operating indicator does not suffice to explain the high level of NPAs, and leaves an unexplained intercept shift. Two of the three weak banks identified by the Varma Committee, Indian Bank and United Bank of India, fall in this category. Recapitalisation of these banks with operational restructuring may therefore not be the solution, since there is clearly a residual problem even after controlling for operating efficiency.||Indira Rajaraman,Garima Vasishtha

The case study documents the efforts of the villagers, the costs they have borne and the benefits they have derived from protecting 500 hectares of degraded forest allotted to them as part of the joint forest management (JFM) in Andhra Pradesh. The VSS is widely regarded as being successful. The paper analyses the reasons for the success of JFM and compares the experience of Behroonguda with other similar experiments in other countries to draw important lessons. The paper strikes one discordant note: The people of Behroonguda have not been clearly told when the forest department's financial and technical support would end. For JFM to be sustainable, it is important that forest staff be redeployed to other needy communities and the financial support to silvicultural and other conservation activities be discontinued. Only then will the Behroonguda experiment be deemed fully successful and sustainable.||Emmanuel D'Silva,B. Nagnath

It econometrically tests a few hypotheses on the basis of firm level panel data for a set of Indian industries. One of the strong results of the paper is that firm level outward orientation of exports and imports contributes significantly and positively to firm level productivity. This finding supports one of the propositions of the new growth theory that developing economies benefit significantly from free trade with developed economies through free flow of new ideas and technologies and externalities.||Murali Patibandla,B.

Further, it was a mere 'amendment' exercise, and the resulting document can hardly be described as a 'new policy'. The two most egregious failures of the new NWP are in relation to water-harvesting and community management of water. The prime minister's speech to the NWRC stressed both, but there is nothing corresponding to this in the NWP. Important controversies such as those relating to water as 'commodity' versus water as 'commons' or 'a basic right', the desirability of water markets, etc, are ignored. A valuable opportunity for a comprehensive review and a well-considered new statement has been lost. However, NWP 2002 is now the officially declared policy, and will stay in place for some years. While pointing out deficiencies and calling for revisions, the attempt must be to see what can be done with the document as it exists. Through proper, effective and repeated citation, the document can in fact be made to come alive and serve useful purposes.||Ramaswamy R. Iyer

Using pooled data analysis for the period 1995-96 to 1999-2000, the analysis reveals that (i) size plays an important role in influencing OBS activities, and (ii) higher the levels of capital and liquid assets, lower the incentive of the banks to engage in OBS activities. This is in consonance with hedging theory, which contends that the aversion to risk might be an important determinant for banks not actively engaging in OBS activities.||D. M. Nachane,Saibal Ghosh

Based on a primary survey carried out among slum-dwellers in Delhi, this study examines the links between duration of migration, distance of migration, occupation and the incidence of poverty. With experience, it is found that migrants are more likely to move from low income and casual jobs to high income and regular jobs, and thus undergo an increase in their standards of living.||Indrani Gupta,Arup Mitra

The objective of the present paper is to analyse if indeed the distance of a village from the nearest town has a systematic impact on its socio-economic characteristics. The distributional pattern of the indicators of economic well-being, health, education, etc, shows that their values do not necessarily decline along smooth gradients, as we move from the city/town to its periphery.||Amitabh Kundu,Basanta K.

The surprising aspect of this phenomenon is that the political regime had been more oppressive during the Mughal era and during the rule of the British East India Company which ended in 1857. Using both mainstream and subaltern literature, this paper argues that the sudden rise of peasant revolutions in Bengal under the British crown can be explained by the theory of preference falsification on the part of the peasants before the period under discussion, which could help to explain such instances of social discontinuity in human behaviour.||Sumon Kumar Bhaumik

In fact, its moves over the last decade have, if anything, been in precisely the opposite direction. Thus today not only is a faculty appointee assured of job security fairly quickly, when hired against a permanent vacancy, s/he is also guaranteed promotions to successively higher levels based on the number of years of service put in at each level. Against this background, the recent UGC proposal that faculty appointments in institutions of higher education should henceforth be on contract for a limited term will serve one purpose and one purpose alone - that of reducing the central and state governments' expenditure on higher education. To believe that the proposal was motivated by a desire to improve standards of teaching and research in these institutions would be to doubt the intelligence of the eminent members of the UGC.||

It is argued in this paper that the existing system has become unwieldy and unsustainable and that the time has come to review it, especially in the context of panchayat raj institutions (PRI) and the role they are expected to play in regard to the rural poor. With the help of illustrative data from two drought-prone districts of Karnataka, an attempt is made in the paper to demonstrate the feasibility of a decentralised system operated by PRI based on the local staples consumed by the poor. The result seems encouraging enough to suggest that it would be worthwhile to have more substantive investigation as also pilot projects to test the workability of the decentralised system.||V. M.

But merely punishing the guilty will not ensure sweeping changes. At the very outset, the need for change must recognise the disparities that exist, as for instance, the procedural differences between in-country vs inter-country adoption processes. It must also involve all actors in the system including the children themselves.||S. Aarthi Anand,Prema Chandra

The poverty estimates are broadly consistent with independent evidence on per capita expenditure, state domestic product and real agricultural wages. They show that poverty decline in the 1990s proceeded more or less in line with earlier trends. Regional disparities increased in the 1990s, with the southern and western regions doing much better than the northern and eastern regions. Economic inequality also increased within states, especially within urban areas, and between urban and rural areas. We briefly examine other development indicators, relating for instance to health and education. Most indicators have continued to improve in the nineties, but social progress has followed very diverse patterns, ranging from accelerated progress in some fields to slow down and even regression in others. We find no support for sweeping claims that the nineties have been a period of 'unprecedented improvement' or 'widespread impoverishment'.||Angus Deaton,Jean Dreze

If secularism, as we have recently been told, has multiple meanings, so too does faith. In our own recent history, there is perhaps no better practical instance of the effort to find a non-religious bedrock for morality than that of Nehru himself. Today, as we survey the shattered nationalisms of the Balkans, as we feel collapsing about us the ruins of Arab nationalism, as we see the precipice on which nations like Indonesia balance, it is more important than ever to see the force of what Nehru understood. It is exactly religion's persistence, its fulsome presence as we stumble into the new century that, far from undermining or disproving the force of Nehru's views on the subject, exactly underline their relevance and resonance for us today. On this particular point, he just was right.||Sunil Khilnani

Small producers resort to marketing the 'distress surplus', and increasing costs of cultivation render them more dependent on large landowners for high-interest loans. The author's findings suggest that in a scenario of unequal distribution of land and resources, the embrace of new technology by small cultivators, far from leading to greater 'income diffusion', deepens their dependence on those with economic, social and political power.||Kalpana Wilson

Appropriate policies for technology development and dissemination, though, can yield significant economic, environmental and social benefits, and need to be considered as part of a diversified portfolio of strategies to meet the country's pressing energy goals. Attention needs to be paid to the development of appropriate ER and D policies and a portfolio that is consistent with the needs of various sections of the country's citizenry and economy. What all of this requires, above all, is a focus on revamping the process of ER and D planning and implementation.||Ambuj Sagar

The difference is that the first set of problems are intra-sectoral while the second is inter-sectoral. This paper attempts to study the environmental impact of water pollution on rural communities in general and on agricultural production, human health, and livestock in particular. Some important issues in this regard are (a) linkages between industrial development and changes in the micro (local) environment; (b) damage to crops and animal husbandry due to industrial pollution; and (c) impact on health and sanitation in rural communities. These issues are studied in detail with the help of primary data collected from a pollution-affected village in Andhra Pradesh.||Bhagirath Behera,V. Ratna Reddy

India's social sector expenditure in the 1990s was lower than that in the 1980s and also less than that of most other developing countries. With India ranking 115th in the Human Development Index, there is an obvious need to step up social sector expenditure and improve fund utilisation.||S. Mahendra Dev,Jos Mooij
