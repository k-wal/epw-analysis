While the ex-servicemen have been rigid on all their demands, including ones that defy sound reasoning, the manner in which the bureaucracy continues to quibble on minor issues grates on the military's sense of honour and dignity.||Srinath Raghavan
24-12-2015||commentary||---------||Challenges Facing New Education Policy in India||The New Education Policy on the anvil should encourage academic talent and innovation to make the system of higher education more responsive to the needs of various stakeholders instead of just attempting to create a uniform standardised structure. To ensure this, political and bureaucratic interference in educational institutions, which has steadily eroded the quality of higher education in India, will have to be minimised, academic autonomy strengthened and diverse opinions taken into account while building a new policy framework.||Arun Kumar

Security experts, in parallel, have started talking about the infl uence of the Islamic State in radicalising Kashmir's youth. What this indicates is that the Indian establishment is unwilling to learn from its own past mistakes and remains trapped in the hubris of its own propaganda.||Gautam Navlakha

It presents a few suggestions for the revival of the Congress Party.||Sujay Ghosh

It is a victory for women's emancipation from the narrow purview of the law, which in its bid to uphold legal justice, compromises social justice. The judgment also strengthens the case for an overhaul of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, which has been long overdue.||Manalika Borgohain
24-12-2015||insight||---------||Coming Back to Normal? : Census 2011 and Sex Ratios in India||An analysis of data from Censuses 2001 and 2011 shows that despite the increase in overall population sex ratio in this period, the 0-6 sex ratio and 0-1 sex ratio have continued to decline. This suggests that there is no let-up in daughter defi cit. However, one positive factor is that the north-western states which have had a long history of high levels of daughter defi cit have shown an increase in the 0-1 sex ratio. The reasons for this need to be determined. Another positive aspect is that daughter defi cit seems to be lower amongst the younger cohort of currently married women; it will be interesting to see whether this persists as the cohort ages.||S Irudaya Rajan,Sharada Srinivasan,Arjun S Bedi
24-12-2015||review of rural affairs||---------||Rural Elites and the Limits of Scheduled Caste Assertiveness in Rural Malwa, Punjab :||The decline of caste-based territorial dominance is widely reported to have given Scheduled Castes more autonomy, but also allowed them more space for political assertion. This paper, drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in the predominantly agrarian region of Malwa in Punjab, illustrates how SCs are often loudly pressing demands upon political leaders and bureaucrats. However, the paper also illustrates how they still do not wield meaningful power in village panchayats. A wealthy class of farmers that is increasingly involved in urban business uses a combination of party connections, cash and coercion to capture and maintain power at their expense. Such farmers frequently use their political influence to bolster their business interests and to appropriate state resources such as village common lands. The evidence presented here suggests that when SCs mobilise to demand their rights, they are still careful not to challenge dominant interests.||Nicolas Martin
24-12-2015||review of rural affairs||---------||Structural Change in Bihar's Rural Economy : Findings from a Longitudinal Study||Bihar has been showing signs of emerging from stagnation and backwardness. For this to occur in full, an agrarian transformation is central in a state where urbanisation remains very low. This paper uses longitudinal household data from a sample of villages to explore changes in production relations, land and other assets, agricultural development and occupational diversification. There has been a significant change in class structure and a shift away from agricultural occupations for male workers (much less for female), but non-agricultural work is mainly outside the village and largely outside the state. Real wages have risen substantially, more than can be explained by rising agricultural productivity, migration being an important contributory factor. But the segmentation of the rural labour market has increased and local development is uneven.||Alakh N Sharma,Gerry Rodgers
24-12-2015||review of rural affairs||---------||Explaining Village-level Development Trajectories through Schooling in Karnataka :||This paper develops and explores a methodology for explaining development trajectories at the village-level. Using data from the Censuses of 2001 and 2011, and qualitative and quantitative data from three purposively selected villages in North Karnataka, it asks why literacy rates and schooling vary considerably in geographically proximate villages. In advancing an explanation, the paper attends to what has been termed the micro-macro problem in analytical sociology as well as the problem of spatial variability, neither of which has been systematically addressed in the literature on rural change in India. The data and methodology used here help identify two social mechanisms--livelihoods enhancement practices and social cooperation--which together explain why one village (Chennooru) experiences stable and higher levels of schooling relative to its neighbours where either livelihoods enhancement practices are absent (Valasooru) or there is a lack of social cooperation (Banadooru). The approach and analysis in the paper imply that attention to social mechanisms aids the crafting of more robust policies on schooling and development.||Suraj Jacob,Balmurli Natrajan,Indira Patil

24-12-2015||review of rural affairs||---------||Dalit Mobilisation and Faction Politics in Rural Andhra Pradesh : Everyday Life of a Dalit NGO and Agricultural Labour Union||This paper explores the relations between the trajectories of Dalit assertion and of faction politics in contemporary Rayalaseema in rural Andhra Pradesh. Based on a case study of a local hybrid alliance between a Dalit NGO and a Dalit agricultural labour union, it examines how Dalit organisations deal with the state and politics at village and town levels in a context of economic and political insecurities. It shows how the decline of Dalit collective forms of mobilisation in the 2000s has reinforced feelings of disempowerment among Dalit activists who look at goondaism and bossism as concrete and direct modes of assertion. The article then investigates the ambivalent relations between Dalit agenda, individual social mobility and dependence on faction leaders.||David Picherit
24-12-2015||special articles||---------||What Is the Cost of Providing One Rupee of Support to the Poor?||The enduring equity-efficiency debate on India’s food policy revolves around two key issues—leakage of cereal grains from the system, and reduction in benefits at the extensive margin to reduce the fiscal burden. Using descriptive analysis and costing techniques, it is found that the public distribution system works well in regions with low market access, high cereal prices, and high poverty. It protects households from inflation through a price ceiling that automatically adjusts the value of the real implicit transfer. However, the biggest weakness is its one-size-fits-all approach. Even without leakages, some states will not benefit as much from such a costly cereal subsidy because of low market prices for cereals in those states. Overall, it is found that inclusivity and the possibility of leakage reduction, thereof, has the potential to deliver a net gain of $1 billion in social welfare from the status quo.||Suman Chakrabarti,Pallavi Rajkhowa
24-12-2015||special articles||---------||Narratives of Exclusion : Space, Insecurity and Identity in a Muslim Neighbourhood||Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork carried out in a "Muslim" neighbourhood in Kolkata, this paper attempts to understand the ways in which Muslim socio-spatial segregation gets constructed and maintained within the landscape of Indian cities. It argues that in the case of Kolkata, Muslim socio-spatial segregation can be viewed as an unfortunate consequence of the dual processes of bhadralok cultural prejudice against Muslims as well as the insecurity Muslims encounter on an everyday basis in the city. The restrictive and debilitating effects of exclusion based on spatial stigma, especially the ways in which they affect Muslims belonging to various socio-economic dispositions, are emphasised. Continued instances of exclusion can potentially engender a reverse assertion of identity by segregated groups who might eventually find it feasible to construct a monolithic and exclusive identity set apart from, and in opposition to, the city's mainstream.||Anasua Chatterjee
24-12-2015||special articles||---------||Poverty across Social and Religious Groups in Uttar Pradesh : An Interregional Analysis||The article is an attempt at a comprehensive understanding of regional as well as disaggregated (district-wise) patterns of poverty prevailing among social and religious groups in Uttar Pradesh by using unit level records of the 61st (2004-05) and 68th (2011-12) rounds of NSSO's Consumption Expenditure Survey. It identifies the critical regions in UP, where poverty among social and religious groups is unfairly distributed. Estimates reveal that though poverty in the state reduced by 11.50% points between 2004-05 and 2011-12, it remained quite high among Scheduled Castes (40.87%) and Muslims (34.88%), particularly in the central, southern and eastern regions of the state. The study also attempts to gauge the causes for the unequal distribution of poverty among social and religious groups in the state and goes on to suggest that region specific and group specific development programmes may be more effective in alleviating poverty among social and religious groups.||Akarsh Arora,S P Singh

They are not offering airbags or anti-lock braking systems in most of the base models costing less than $12,000. It is the responsibility of the Government of India to announce strict crashworthiness standards for cars sold in India, since vehicle manufacturers generally do not provide safety features unless forced to do so.||Dinesh Mohan,Abhaya jha

It set goals of peace and security that encourage everyone to be liberal with unfettered freedom to access the market, and, on the other hand, allow the European Union to follow interventionist policies near abroad. The consequences of the union are to be found in Europe's restrictive and contradictory policies and programmes relating to immigration and refugee protection. The European migration crisis originates from this contradiction.||Ranabir Samaddar
17-12-2015||special articles||---------||Indian Insolvency Regime in Practice : An Analysis of Insolvency and Debt Recovery Proceedings||While there is much anecdotal evidence on the abysmal track record of courts and tribunals in resolving insolvency proceedings, there have to date been few empirical studies of how the Indian insolvency regime functions in practice. This paper is based on an analysis of select high court and tribunal judgments with the aim of gaining a better understanding of the existing insolvency resolution process for companies and to identify where the delays and bottlenecks lie. Three themes that emerged from this exploratory study are: (i) the significant inefficiencies and conflicts that have resulted from having a number of different laws and legal forums to govern companies in distress, (ii) various judicial innovations and weak institutions that have contributed to enormous delays in insolvency proceedings, and (iii) misinterpretations of the law by debt recovery tribunals when considering cases of debt enforcement under the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act. As India moves towards enacting a new insolvency and bankruptcy legislation, it is hoped that this study will be helpful in understanding the urgent need for reform and in providing initial insights on the direction the new law should take.||Aparna Ravi

This has been juxtaposed with an analysis of factual reportage produced by civil society actors, narratives from films, poems and an analysis of public opinion. There is much more in-depth analysis that has been done on each of these separately, but this study brings them together. It is in the coming together of insights from different sources that we can begin to see the historical event holistically. It is through this exercise that the interplay of state power and the production of marginality take place. Marginality of certain aspects of the truth as well as marginality of the Muslim community in the case need to be understood in this context.||Pooja Bakshi

Narratives of and interviews with the imported casual paid labour working on the Manali-Leh highway as for the Border Roads Organisation show us that illness, death and injury accompany the dangerous work of building roads in the high altitude of the upper Himalayas. The "unskilled" or "disposable" labourer is never able to accumulate additional utility or human capital even after many years of experience. His only capital--the body--is treated as a disposable and inanimate piece of machinery that loses its value in order to generate value for the nation.||Anu Sabhlok,Hoiwan Cheung,Yogesh Mishra

It describes the legal, bureaucratic and often extralegal methods employed to enact land acquisition law and documents the processes and narrative fictions that coalesced into our present understandings of the state's relation to land and law's relation to ethics. It also throws light upon the workings of the "reality" that law constructed and enacted in devising the principle of eminent domain.||Debjani Bhattacharyya

11-12-2015||special articles||---------||Health Insurance, Health Access and Financial Risk Protection||Drawing from the 60th and 68th rounds of National Sample Survey Office, this study evaluates the impact of different (social, commercial and target-oriented) health insurance schemes on access to healthcare use, and cost of care and financing of medical expenses. The results show that though these schemes promote access to healthcare, they also increase the costs manifold. The commercial insurers have not been effective at pooling financial risks and seem to be indulging in maximising individual gain. Given the intrinsic market-failure and information asymmetry between the principal and the agents and difficulties in regulating the insurance-base system, this study advocates financing healthcare through a tax-based system which can be cost-effective for achieving universal healthcare access in India.||Shailender Kumar Hooda

A preliminary analysis indicates that in those areas where special efforts were made, such as in increasing institutional delivery and expanding immunisation coverage, some results are seen. This calls for greater investments in health and nutrition within a more comprehensive approach.||Dipa Sinha

03-12-2015||commentary||---------||The Essential Cancer Drugs||There are no public procurement programmes for cancer on the lines of those that exist for AIDS or tuberculosis. It is worth considering whether it is feasible to institute a drug procurement programme based on international/national competitive bidding or shopping, like those already in place in the National AIDS Control Organisation. If patients in developed countries are finding it difficult to survive the astronomical prices of cancer drugs, a developing country like India, with a large part of its population below the poverty line or among the middle class, is even worse affected in the battle against the disease.||Vasudha Wattal

03-12-2015||commentary||---------||Double Nature of Orthodox Truths : Reactions to the Paris Carnage||In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on Paris, a popular left wing argument highlighted the culpability of imperialism in fuelling this violence. This form of anti-imperialism ends up denying historical agency to Muslims, and people in the postcolonial countries as a whole, and often becomes an excuse for Islamic fundamentalism. This article argues for a politics which escapes this trap of speaking a truth that is also a lie.||Tabish Khair
03-12-2015||insight||---------||Civilians Caught in Crossfire :||India and Pakistan are parties to the Geneva Conventions which are the keystones of International Humanitarian Law. However, notwithstanding the IHL, whenever both belligerents engage in ceasefire violations, indiscriminate firing and shelling across the Line of Control and international border, the civilians residing in these areas are subject to fearsome violence. This study points out that escalation of violence along the Indo-Pak border has enormous physical, economic and psychosocial ramifications on the lives of civilians in these areas.||Meha Dixit,Sameer Yasir
03-12-2015||special articles||---------||Challenging Economic Inequality : Tactics and Strategies||Economic and social inequality is a major problem, implicated in poverty, ill health and exploitation. Inequality has increased in many countries since the 1980s and it is also widely seen as unfair, yet action against it has been sporadic and often ineffective. To better understand why inequality has persisted, it is useful to look at tactics that reduce public outrage over it. These include covering up the existence and impacts of inequality, denigrating those who are less well-off, explaining the existence of inequality as natural, necessary or beneficial, using official channels to justify inequality, threatening those who challenge it and rewarding those who defend it. Each of these tactics can be countered, resulting in a set of options for those pursuing a fairer world.||Brian Martin,Susan Engel
03-12-2015||special articles||---------||Towards Methodologies for Multiple Objective-Based Energy and Climate Policy||Planning for India's energy future requires addressing multiple and simultaneous economic, social and environmental challenges. While there has been conceptual progress towards harnessing their synergies, there are limited methodologies available for operationalising a multiple objective framework for development and climate policy. This paper proposes a "multi-criteria decision analysis" approach to this problem, using illustrative examples from the cooking and buildings sectors. An MCDA approach enables policy processes that are analytically rigorous, participative and transparent, which are required to address India's complex energy and climate challenges.||Radhika Khosla,Srihari Dukkipati,Navroz K Dubash,Ashok Sreenivas,Brett Cohen
03-12-2015||special articles||---------||Imaginations of Self and Struggle : Women in the Kashmiri Armed Resistance||This paper aims to interpret construction of the self and struggles of nationhood of some Muslim women in Kashmir's resistance movement against Indian control , focusing on the phase of the armed struggle in the 1980s. It argues that they have been continually refashioning their notions of self and notions of just and free political community, and have cast themselves in religious -cultural terms to suit the needs of the movement. Muslim women with an active role in the armed struggle underwent a process of self-constitution in the processes of engagement with their immediate social and political context. There are women with a Muslim identity, who may or may not be practising Muslims when they intervene in political action. Yet, they were invariably cast in religious -cultural terms, forgetting that they have challenged both the Indian state and its patriarchy of militarism, alongside that within their own community.||Inshah Malik

They respect religious heterogeneity and even though the Hindu population in Kamorta and Katchal is small, there are numerous Hindu temples around, to which the Nicobarese have never objected. Their opposition to marriage alliances with outsiders is not religiously motivated but provoked by the undue advantage that the non-Nicobarese have taken by encroaching on their land and also disrupting the hitherto harmonious socio-economic dynamics.

26-11-2015||appointments of judges||---------||Judicial Primacy and the Basic Structure : A Legal Analysis of the NJAC Judgment||This article is a legal analysis of the Supreme Court judgment in the appointment of judges case. It argues that a majority of the judges did not hold judicial primacy to be part of the basic structure, as has been commonly misunderstood. Further, their application of their understanding of judicial primacy to strike down the presence of the Union Law Minister and eminent persons on the National Judicial Appointments Commission is flawed.

Now we have aggressive attempts by vocal sections of the Bharatiya Janata Party and its affiliates to insist on extending the ban to cover production, sale and consumption of beef.

Since the normative goals of a polity and political contingency are in a perpetual struggle in India, the time is appropriate for us to visit the UCC debate with a view to strengthening our constitutional democracy. This article after presenting an overview of the debate suggests that there are mainly two paths to follow to meet this aspiration: (i) changing the ecology of laws relating to women, and (ii) adopting the common civil code that is prevalent in Goa.||Peter Ronald deSouza
26-11-2015||special articles||---------||'Build Back Better' and the Creation of a 'Psychic Economy of Want' in Post-Tsunami Sri Lanka :||This paper suggests that post-disaster assistance in the Global South is a version of "slum development" on a compressed scale in terms of time and an expanded one in terms of resources. The index of this is the slogan "build back better." It implies that communities affected by a disaster are a priori a dilapidated lot, and disasters like the 2004 tsunami are a great cleansing. It allows aid agencies that arrive bearing gifts like Santa Claus an opportunity to transform a blighted existence into a civilised one. Each of them arrives not only with a heraldic logo but also with their own plans to build back better. The result is a plethora of architectural styles and ownership patterns leading to a realigning of relations among victims, and between victims and non-victims. This realigning, in a climate of sudden and large influx of money and material goods, rather than assuaging their loss and grief, creates a chimera of plenitude that ironically leads to an elusive but persistent and widespread sense of discontent across different segments of society.||Harish Naraindas
26-11-2015||special articles||---------||Growth, Imports and Inequality : Explaining the Persistently High Trade Deficit in India||One of the striking features of the Indian economy in recent years has been a sharp rise in the share of the trade deficit in the gross domestic product. While the period of high GDP growth was characterised by an even faster widening of the trade deficit, the subsequent slowdown has not reduced the deficit proportionately. The widening of the trade deficit in GDP has been primarily due to a similar rise in the import-GDP ratio. One of the main reasons for the rise in the import-GDP ratio, and the persistence of a high trade deficit is rising inequality in the economy.||Subhanil Chowdhury,Zico Dasgupta

While LPG subsidies have played an important role in expanding access to this cooking fuel, directing the subsidies to the poorest and the most vulnerable remains a fraught matter. This article proposes that consumers opt in for the subsidy by self-certifying that their household income is less than an amount set by the government, instead of the opt-out approach followed today.||Alok Tripathi,Ambuj D Sagar,Kirk R Smith

With more than a million permanent workers, the tea plantation industry is the largest in the formal private sector in the country. Yet wages of these workers are the lowest in the formal sector and their living conditions are appalling. Though there are laws that govern the living conditions of workers, these are violated and the state seems indifferent.||Sharit K Bhowmik
19-11-2015||special articles||---------||Of Militarisation, Counter-insurgency and Land Grabs in Kashmir :||It is sometimes claimed that Operation Sadbhavana, a counter-insurgency programme deployed to win the "hearts and minds" of the alienated masses of Kashmir has been successful. The local populace, however, considers these programmes as a tactic devised by the army to bolster its credibility and reach. The army occupation of large swathes of land in Kashmir has resulted in depeasantisation of rural areas, compounding the alienation of the people. This paper examines the narratives underlying the Sadbhavana programmes, military land grabs, and the counter-insurgency methods adopted in strife-torn Kashmir. It suggests that the army's belief that it can battle insurgency, which is essentially a political issue, through development projects and "effective governance" is an erroneous perception of reality.||Jingzhong Ye,Peer Ghulam Nabi

It then reconsiders the long history of social categories across the Indian subcontinent to develop a new model of dominant landed community that would apply across all its regions and faiths. In conclusion, it suggests some new terms that might replace tribe in Indian social thought.||Sumit Guha
19-11-2015||special articles||---------||Culture, Community and Institutions : Voluntary Provision of Public Goods in Maharashtra||Mainstream economic theory holds that economic agents are purely self-interested players. However, individual preferences could be socially determined by sustained enculturation in contexts that emphasise and applaud cooperative behaviour that may lead to pro-social individual preferences. If this is the case, communities with long-established social norms of cooperation might make individuals behave more cooperatively even when selfish behaviour is guaranteed to go unpunished. Can communities where the norm of cooperation is culturally embedded solve social dilemmas better than communities which lack such cultures? Can such cultures be engineered in a relatively short span of time? These questions were evaluated through a finitely repeated public good game in two model villages of Maharashtra, known for local development achieved through voluntary labour, and two villages lacking such a history. We observed higher contributions to public goods in communities with histories of cooperation. And found that variations across individuals were significantly higher than variations across villages, indicating that village-wide cultures may not be as important as individual-level preferences.||Neeraj Hatekar,Parinaaz Mehta,Savita Kulkarni

19-11-2015||commentary||---------||Community Land Reserves :||Community Land Reserves (called Community Land Trusts in the US) have been in existence around the world for over 40 years. They are non-profit organisations with a mission to provide affordable housing to low income groups, for all time. Someone starts one off by providing a gift of land. The organisation then takes this gift of land off the market to hold it in trust forever thereafter. Ownership of the land remains with the organisation, which cannot sell it. Individual parcels are given out to owners who build on them and own the construction but not the land. On resale, the owner recoups the cost of his construction, adjusted to present-day value, but not the appreciation in land value. As a result, the incoming occupant can also get housing at an affordable price, because it is unburdened by land value. Critical to success are the format of governance of the organisation and the resale formula.||Shirish B Patel

These elections also underscore a new pattern of localisation of politics, where localised ethnic agenda and armed groups have infl uenced the distribution of tickets and electoral outcomes.

The new estimates are more realistic, claims the Central Statistics Office, as they better represent the contribution of nearly a million "active companies." Critics are unconvinced, however. Seeking to narrow the differences between the competing views, this paper compares the official figures with an alternative estimate for the private corporate sector to gauge the magnitude of (the claimed) improvement, or (the putative) overestimation.||R Nagaraj
05-11-2015||special articles||---------||Gender-based Crime and Gender Inequality in India : A Subnational Analysis||This study, using health, empowerment and labour market metrics, reviews gender inequality and gender-based crimes in India at the subnational level. The findings show that gender-based crime rates have grown while general crime rates have decreased over the years. Further, the distribution of states by the gender inequality index does not follow a pattern. States with low and high GII show similar average rates for gender-based crimes while moderate GII states show the highest average rates for gender-based crimes. The growth rates for gender-based crimes, however, are lowest for low GII states but continue to be the highest for moderate GII states.||Paribhasha Sharma

These agents trap the farmers in a vicious circle of indebtedness. Based on a field survey, this study locates the commission agent system in Punjab's agriculture set-up and recommends reframing it in order to extricate farmers from the clutches of these agents.||Shruti Bhogal,Sukhpal Singh

30-10-2015||commentary||---------||India's Population Programme : Obstacles and Opportunities||As sterilisation scandals abound, a consensus is emerging for a shift away from sterilisation towards a larger "basket" of contraceptive choices and concomitant improvements in service delivery. That such a shift needs to take place is clear, but precisely how it is to come about, and who gets to determine what is in the basket of choices are questions that deserve greater attention. The neo-Malthusian resurgence, combined with the technical fixation on contraception, favours certain methods over others, but health and safety concerns related to these methods are typically downplayed or suppressed.||Betsy Hartmann,Mohan Rao

This policy was heavily criticised due to the costs it entailed as well as its failure to achieve targets. This article looks at this policy's effect on rice crop yields. The findings suggest that crop yields were unaffected by the policy, even though farmers tended to resort to more electricityintensive irrigation methods.||Somdeep Chatterjee

However, its current crop of trains labelled as superfast just cruise along at an average speed of 55 kilometres per hour, but collect a superfast surcharge.

29-10-2015||perspectives||---------||Silencing Caste, Sanitising Oppression : Understanding Swachh Bharat Abhiyan||The Hindu notions of purity and pollution, inextricably linked with the caste system and the practice of untouchability, underlie the unsanitary practices in Indian society. These beliefs perpetuate the oppression of the "polluted castes," who are forced to undertake manual scavenging, unclog manholes and clean other people's filth. The availability of cheap Dalit labour to do these dehumanising jobs can be cited as one of the reasons why development of toilet facilities and a modern garbage and sewage management system have been neglected so far. As long as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan attempts to delink the relationship between caste and sanitation, its lofty goal of cleaning India will remain unachievable.||Subhash Gatade

Details from a few cases through fact-finding visits and interactions present pictures of suffering and courage within entrenched structures of caste, now under siege. The unique place of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act in contemporary Haryana is another major facet of the struggle under way. The paper poses many questions to the women's movement, the wider democratic public, and the state. How much progress has been made in claims towards restorative justice, whereby victimhood can be transformed into meaningful survival?||

This paper examines how the mainstream Hindi and English print and broadcast media has handled such coverage since then. It looks at how the media deals with rapes committed by family members and sexual violence during communal riots and in insurgency-affected areas. It finds that economics plays an important role in what the media reports and the prominence it gives to reports of rape.||Divya Arya
28-10-2015||review of women's studies||---------||Gathering Steam : Organising Strategies of the Indian Men’s Rights Movement||From faint beginnings in scattered solitary actions in the 1990s, the activities of men's rights activists have emerged in India as a well-organised social movement. They denounce feminists with a broad brush, portend the impending doom of the institutions of marriage and family, and particularly attack the simultaneous use of civil and criminal laws relating to marriage and domestic violence for alleged harassment of husbands. This paper uses an ethnographic account of one Delhi group to examine their political strategies and techniques of shaping community and identity. There are lessons here for feminist organisations: from understanding the varied anxieties that bring people to such groups, to identifying the conflation between specific weak cases and general castigation of wives, to studying the specific tactics of an energetic grass-roots contemporary movement.||Srimati Basu
28-10-2015||review of women's studies||---------||Protection of Women from Domestic Violence :||After a prolonged campaign for criminal and civil laws to curb domestic violence, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 came into force. However, lasting solutions to the problem continue to be elusive, as the grim statistics of wife murders and suicides by married women record a steady rise. This article takes a close look at the manner in which this law is being implemented on the ground, and the many shortcomings, even as women continue to be blamed--earlier for "misusing" the law and now for not wanting to approach the courts because the justice delivery system is tardy. The crux of the issue is the support network that the victim of domestic violence needs and it is here that the implementation of the domestic violence law has failed most spectacularly.||Audrey D'Mello,Flavia Agnes
28-10-2015||review of women's studies||---------||Some Thoughts on Extreme Violence and the Imagination :||This paper explores the relationship between torture and sexual violence. As I understand it, sexual shaming, humiliation and hurt are inalienable aspects of torture inflicted on men, women and transpersons. In this sense, torture is nothing but the utter and violent perversion of the sense of touch, of that recognition of bodily being occasioned by physical intimacy. While easy correspondences between torture and sexual violence cannot be established they are related. To this end, this paper addresses the following questions: How do victims of torture survive that experience? What affords succour to those who have endured unspeakable pain? How is one to understand the manic intensity with which the torturer inflicts violence? It draws upon a range of texts to do with torture and sexual violence--fiction, affidavits, court judgments and descriptions of legal trails.||V Geetha
28-10-2015||special articles||---------||Participatory Note Investments : Do Indian Markets Need Them?||Investments through participatory notes in the Indian stock market have been a cause for concern for policymakers. It is argued that P-Notes did play a role in attracting foreign investments, when suitable instruments were unavailable in India. But, today, with new liquid contracts available in Indian equity markets, P-Notes serve no purpose other than providing anonymity to foreign investors, and a potential route for tax evasion. From statistical analysis, it was found that P-Note inflows/outflows seem to be determined by rupee -dollar exchange rate movements, and not by fundamental price-to-earnings ratios, or even sentiment indicators like put-call ratio and advances-to-declines ratio. Policymakers must discourage foreign institutional investors from moving to P-Notes to avoid tax, and in the long term P-Notes must be phased out--the first step could be setting caps on investments through P-Notes at the firm level and at an aggregate level as well.||S S S Kumar
29-10-2015||special articles||---------||Fertiliser Use and Imbalance in India : Analysis of States||The common and strongly-held view in India is that balanced fertiliser use requires three major plant nutrients, namely, nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium, to be used in the ratio of 4:2:1, and any deviation in fertiliser use from this norm would constrain growth in crop productivity. This officially-accepted perception, a product of 1950s experiments, has led to wrong policies on fertilisers. Estimating actual and normative quantity of N, P and K for each state of India corresponding to the current cropping pattern, it is found that contrary to the notion that there is excess use of nitrogen in India, 12 major states were found using less than the required level. India, in fact, faces large deficits in use of P and K. It calls for curtailing the use of N in one-third of the states and raising it in the remaining two-thirds.||Pavithra S,Ramesh Chand
30-10-2015||special articles||---------||To Eat or Not To Eat Beef : Spectres of Food on Bengal’s Politics of Identity||Politics around food has been drawing scholarly attention, especially after state governments run by the political right-wing banned food items. This article draws upon local culinary practices in Bengal and its cultures of food. It shows how food and eating habits are not just important in creating a politics of solidarity among Muslims and Dalits, but they are also important in the creation of a predominantly caste-Hindu Bhadralok "habitus." The article also draws attention to limitations of such political liaison between Dalits and Muslims on the basis of shared food habits. Drawing upon Pierre Bourdieu's idea of "cultural capital," this article shows how dominant communities construct their unmarked claims on being progressive and modern by consuming and avoiding the same food item, depending on social, political and historical contingencies.||Kalyan Das

21-10-2015||special articles||---------||Political Society and Its Discontents : Translating Passive Revolution in India and South Africa Today||For all their evident differences, what makes contemporary India and South Africa together so compelling is the coincidence of neo-liberal forms of capitalism generating intense inequality and "surplus" populations, liberal and popular expressions of democracy, and amplifying nationalisms--all entangled with gender power, and shot through with race (South Africa), caste and communalism (India). Partha Chatterjee's concepts of political and civil society, and his claims about a new phase of passive revolution, seem to provide a neat ready-made comparative frame and have significant appeal in South Africa today. Yet this schema provides no resources for coming to grips with Hindutva, or with proliferating articulations of nationalism in South Africa. This article focuses on the concept of passive revolution, and suggests how substantially different understandings and translations of passive revolution might enable mutually illuminating comparative understandings.||Gillian Hart
21-10-2015||special articles||---------||Post-Tsunami Humanitarian Aid : A Trojan Horse in the Southern Nicobar Islands||Historically, the Nicobarese of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have lived in isolation with sporadic cross-cultural contact. Relying on the traditional knowledge and the resources provided by their ecosystem, the indigenes subsisted independently in their tribal reserve until the Indian Ocean tsunami inundated the Nicobar archipelago. Post-tsunami, the ANI administration undertook massive humanitarian interventions in the southern Nicobar Islands. This article analyses the post-tsunami sociocultural change among the Nicobarese against the backdrop of the humanitarian aid administration that began in December 2004. The article specifically inquires into the post-tsunami strategic-spatial interventions in the Nicobarese ecological niche and argues that the change after the tsunami has been tacitly engineered through humanitarian interventions.||Ajay Saini

The idea was to expose domestic enterprises to international competition to enhance efficiency and promote growth. But rather than promoting efficient growth, this paper shows how import liberalisation has damaged the domestic sector. In the absence of adequate government support, the private sector in manufacturing could not perform the role expected of it. Rejuvenation of the manufacturing sector requires a fundamental reorientation of the role of government.||Sudip Chaudhuri

And what implications does it have for domestic development choices? This article examines India's INDC through each lens, to understand the implied logic with regard to India's complex climate-development choices, and with regard to its strategic international choices. It finds that the INDC reflects, as yet, an inadequate consideration of the climate and development linkages that should inform India's actions. The contribution reflects a strategic choice to be "middle of the road," which neither disrupts the fragile diplomatic consensus nor creates pressure for more urgent global action.||Navroz K Dubash,Radhika Khosla

The increase is much more in the case of the SCs. The economic inequality (Gini coefficient) has increased for both SCs and STs in urban India. In rural areas, it has increased for the SCs but has remained almost the same for the STs. In the post-economic reforms period (1993-2012), there is an unambiguous increase in inequality among both SCs and STs, and in the interstate inequality within the SCs and STs, for both rural and urban areas.||Abhishek Singh,Ashish Singh,Kaushalendra Kumar
14-10-2015||special articles||---------||An Egalitarian Green Growth Programme for India :||This paper explores the interrelationships in India between economic growth, expanding employment opportunities and the imperative of dramatically reducing CO2 emissions. Specifically, it shows that within a framework of economic growth, the Indian economy can both expand employment opportunities for workers, peasants and the poor while also reducing CO2 emissions. The model assumes that India grows at an average annual rate of 6.0% over a 20-year period. Within this framework, it proposes that India increase its annual total of public and private investments in energy efficiency and clean renewable energy sources by 1.5% of gross domestic product. The paper finds that India will achieve dramatic CO2 emissions reductions and generate major gains in employment opportunities by undertaking these clean energy investments, as opposed to maintaining the economy's existing fossil-fuel based energy infrastructure. India could accomplish these goals while also eliminating entirely its reliance on nuclear power.||Robert Pollin,Shouvik Chakraborty

The ill-conceived perceptions of political parties, bureaucracy, judiciary and civil society organisations about the so-called "impact" of curricular materials developed by educational professionals on young learners, and the pressure they exert on curriculum development agencies aggravate the situation. All this obstructs curricular reforms initiated to improve the status and quality of social science learning in schools.||M V Srinivasan
14-10-2015||special articles||---------||White Elephant or a Game Changer? : An Analysis of National Optical Fibre Network of India||The National Optical Fibre Network is being implemented largely by public sector organisations in the country. NOFN will connect 2,50,000 gram panchayats. It aims to deliver information and communication technology-based goods and services to the rural households by private service providers by December 2016. Despite support from the top political leaders, the project is delayed by more than two years by bureaucratic hurdles and lack of excitement on the part of the private players. The pilot implementation of the project was able to connect only the government offices. This paper suggests that the absorptive capacity needs to be developed and private players require aggressive goading, but without ignoring the idea of social inclusion. There should be a sustained political support till the final implementation of the project, with large impetus coming from the government in the initial phases.||Nalini Srinivasan,P Vigneswara Ilavarasan
16-10-2015||notes||---------||Families of Murder Victims : What the State and Society Owes Them||This article examines the psychological conditions of the surviving family members of murder victims in India and points out the inadequacies in the formulated and reactionary responses of the state and community. These responses are often exclusively focused on harsh punishments for offenders while failing to consider the circumstances faced by the family members of the murdered. These secondary victims are in need of a holistic response from the state and society.||Penelope Tong

There have been many such plans in the past which have failed. What have we learnt from those experiences? There remain many concerns about the way the new programme is being formulated and executed. The major challenge in PFA is in providing quality, affordable power to rural areas and small consumers. However, the PFA plans do not adequately address these challenges. Based on a study of publicly available state PFA plans and documents, this article raises some key concerns and offers suggestions for a course correction.||Ann Josey,Sreekumar N
09-10-2015||commentary||---------||Report to the UN Human Rights Council on Sri Lanka : An Evaluation||One of the most striking features of the report by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights Investigation on Sri Lanka, 2015 is its consistent effort to be even-handed in its view of Government of Sri Lanka and Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam responsibility for atrocities. Significantly, it does not find evidence that the government or its armed forces engaged in genocide, instead, the crimes are described by the report as consistent with war crimes and crimes against humanity. This analysis finds the report of OISL as contributing to a process of securing the rights of victims and their families, reforming institutions so that similar bloodbaths do not recur in the future, and bringing about reconciliation.||Rohini Hensman

However, all three conditions required for China's capital accumulation have been undermined. The contradictions of Chinese capitalism have led to a falling profit rate, which at current trends may soon fall towards levels historically associated with the Great Depression. A major economic crisis may seriously undermine the political legitimacy of China's current capitalist regime.||Minqi Li,Zhi Li

What are the possibilities and limits of iterations of a feminist futurity? Even as we ask, however, we are brought up short by a more fundamental question: is such a teleological conception of any theory or social movement --however we define feminism--valid?

It points out that the continued dependence of a reconstituted private sector on patronage relations with a reconstituted state can reinforce an investment in procedural democracy, but may at the same time subvert the substantive aspects of democracy.||Kanchan Chandra

It then investigates whether there is any systematic relationship between growth and poverty and also between growth and inequality for the period 1993-94--2011-12. This analysis helps in understanding the proximate and structural factors underlying poverty and inequality. Based on the empirical analysis and review of approaches adopted by some of the Asian countries which have experienced a rapid reduction in poverty, the paper discusses pathways for India to hasten the process of poverty reduction.||R Radhakrishna
08-10-2015||special articles||---------||Impact of Private Tutoring on Learning Levels :||Despite widespread and substantial household expenditure on private tutoring in many developing countries, not much is known about their effects on learning outcomes. The main challenge in estimating such an effect is that the decision to send the child for private tutoring is endogenous. This paper utilises a large household survey conducted in rural India, and employs fixed effect estimation to control for the effect of unobserved variables. It finds a positive and significant effect of private tutoring on learning outcomes for students in Classes 1 to 8. The effect is stronger for disadvantaged students--those who are less wealthy, and those whose parents are relatively less educated.||Ambrish Dongre,Vibhu Tewary

If construction and service input prices are also considered in the construction of the input price deflators, the double deflation method may further raise the manufacturing real income rather than depressing it. Conditions under which single or double deflation can better approximate the Index of Industrial Production growth rate are also discussed.||Ravindra H Dholakia

01-10-2015||commentary||---------||Death Penalty in India : Reflections on the Law Commission Report||The Law Commission of India's 262nd report is the first official document to recommend abolition of death penalty. Its seminal recommendation notwithstanding, the commission's conclusion that divergence in judicial reasoning in the death penalties handed out is cause enough for the abolition of such penalty is too hasty. Further, not applying this recommendation to terror-related offences is fuzzy and unreasoned. If death penalty is no more of a deterrent for terrorism than it is for other crimes, as the commission itself finds, to persist with such a recommendation by using the bogey of "national security" is extremely odd. The report is, however, valuable in creating an intelligent discourse around death penalty in India.||Arghya Sengupta,Ritwika Sharma

01-10-2015||commentary||---------||The Politics of Amnesia :||Fifty years ago, a failed uprising against pro-US army generals (though not against the country's president) in Indonesia became the scapegoat for pogroms and inaugurated a three-decade long period of authoritarianism. Indonesia became the model for the West in its suppression of popular movements in the global South. The elite in Indonesia and its international allies still do not want to talk about their violent methods. This amnesia and the refusal to understand the experiences of popular politics works to the detriment of democracy in the country.||Olle Tornquist

30-09-2015||perspectives||---------||Adivasis and the Anthropological Gaze :||Through the display of material culture, museums invoke not only an imagined Adivasi past, but also a fossilised vision of their cultural present. While these museums tend to fulfil a pedagogical function through the display of material cultural objects, the implicit ideology behind these exhibits has not received the attention it deserves in India. Why do ethnographic museums choose to display predominantly select groups like the tribals? Why not also display upper-caste women and men and their lifeworld? Here is where politics of representation becomes inextricably intertwined with ethnographic displays in museums. This article explores the dynamics of the anthropological gaze and how it has contributed to the construction of the Adivasis as the exotic cultural other.||V Sebastian

Odisha has experimented with several creative policies, including initiating a maternity entitlements scheme in 2011 before the NFSA was enacted, introduction of eggs and decentralised procurement of take-home rations in the ICDS. This article, based on a field study of the two children's schemes in four districts in December 2014, reports how they perform and identifies areas for further action.||Reetika Khera
30-09-2015||special articles||---------||Don't Worry, Be Happy, : A Survey of the Economics of Happiness||Happiness is a subjective measure of the quality of life in all its domains. Lately, the social and economic dimensions of happiness and its measurement have been the subject of some study. There are several factors that affect individual well-being, with income, employment, health, religion, marriage, education and workplace satisfaction being important determinants. Macroeconomic variables such as unemployment, poverty, literacy rate, life expectancy, inflation rate, crime rate and political stability also affect happiness. This article looks at the literature of the economics of happiness and is a survey of the relationship between happiness and several correlates of happiness. It aims to establish that analysing happiness from an economist's perspective can help choose between alternative public policies, and proposes an alternative valuation methodology for non-marketed goods and services.||Chirodip Majumdar,Gautam Gupta
01-10-2015||special articles||---------||Politics of Identity and the Project of Writing : History in Postcolonial India A Dalit Critique||The central orientation of this article is organised around Dalit identity politics and their implications on the project of writing history in postcolonial India. It critically engages with the Subaltern Studies project as a school of postcolonial historiography that claims to represent the voice of the marginalised and yet stops short of acknowledging caste and caste-based oppression as worthy of historical analysis. In particular, it engages with Dipesh Chakrabarty's reflections on Dalit identity politics in postcolonial India and argues that Dalits, while demanding sociopolitical equality and a dignified identity, also challenge the epistemologies of the nation and demand its historical narratives to be egalitarian and inclusive.||Chinnaiah Jangam

Following a miserable defeat of their parties in Lok Sabha 2014 elections, two so-called arch enemies Lalu Yadav and Nitish Kumar have joined forces, after a 25-year hiatus. Despite this, there is considerable uncertainty in the air. Departing from the usual qualitative claims on who will win, this article studies numbers of previous elections to draw a judgment on the type of representation and political competition Bihar can expect to face in its elections. In some ways, it predicts the nature of the election, rather than the result.||Arun Kumar Kaushik,Yugank Goyal

24-09-2015||perspectives||---------||Repairing Complex Historical Injustice :||Political theorists no doubt have to take the history of injustice, for example, untouchability, seriously. But, the beginning point of repair of historical injustice is the "here" and the "now," the democratic context that shapes collective lives and aspirations. Comprehension of how deep the roots of injustice are, is important. But, it is also important not to get trapped too much in the past and in the politics of recrimination and resentment that divides society irremediably, and prevents the consolidation of a consensus on the need to battle discrimination.||Neera Chandhoke
24-09-2015||special articles||---------||Marginality and Historiography : The Case of Kashmir’s History||Keeping Kashmir's history at the centre of debate, this article makes a brief survey of some of the popular history textbooks of modern India. Arguing that modern Indian historiography has been replete with various "silences" when it comes to writing Kashmir history, it tries to look for the reasons for such "silences." From distortions/silencing of facts to management of archives and sources of history writings, it then shows the way in which history writing is controlled in modern India. Looking for the reasons of such distortion/silences, the article argues that Indian historiography of the 19th and 20th centuries has remained confined to the twin pillars of Indian nationalism/national movement and anti-colonial struggle, and, thus, all other struggles that remain outside this dual framework are, more often than not, ignored. The article further states that the problem of history writing increases manifold when one is thinking and talking of writing history of various conflicts zones, like Kashmir, where nationalism slips into jingoism and history becomes the most important site for playing "national politics."||Amit Kumar,Fayaz A Dar
24-09-2015||special articles||---------||Current Account Fallout of FDI in Post-Reform India : Evidence from Manufacturing Sector||Examining trends of foreign exchange use of a consistent sample of foreign affiliated manufacturing firms over the post-reform years, it is found that these firms have a tendency to cause net foreign currency losses at the aggregate level, as well as at the firm level. A shift in preference for outflows through finished goods imports and intangible transaction payments is noted. The firm-level expense intensity has risen for different routes as well, while the export intensity did not vary significantly over the period. The propensity towards foreign exchange use was dissimilar in various ways for comparable local firms. Such patterns raise serious concerns regarding the impact of foreign direct investment on current account of India's balance of payment in direct and possibly shielded ways.||Swati Verma

This article explores the limited utility of the use of tactical nuclear weapons which could still prove to be catastrophic by triggering the escalation of a conventional conflict into nuclear war. An alternative could be that Pakistan and India revive the idea first proposed by India in 1949 and 1950 of a No-War Agreement. The actions forbidden could include support for cross-border militancy and military incursions across the border, as well as subversion, blockades, and disruption of river waters.||A H Nayyar,Zia Mian

The Government of Andhra Pradesh has been aggressively pursuing land pooling through a series of not-too-friendly measures to acquire land for the capital which will be located in a low- to medium-risk flood area.

18-09-2015||commentary||---------||Bank and Poverty Reduction : A Critique of World Development Report 2015||A close reading of the World Bank's World Development Report 2015 shows that it works on the assumption that human beings generally think automatically, socially, and with mental models, and that future development policy, poverty alleviation, and even policy design need to be modified taking this into account. Poverty is a "cognitive tax" suffered because people are incapable of taking advantage of the opportunities that are open to them. The assumption that development experts improving the behaviour of the poor will reduce poverty, however, fails to confront the growing problem of unsustainable inequalities.||M A Oommen
18-09-2015||commentary||---------||Child Labour Law Amendment : Applying the Brakes on Social Mobility||The proposed amendment to the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act 1986 hopes to align it with the Right to Education Act, 2009. It prohibits child labour up to 14 years and regulates the employment of children between the ages of 15 and 18 years. But the proviso that children can help in the family occupation after school hours or in the fields, home-based work, forest produce gathering or attend technical institutions during vacations, is bound to be misused. Besides, it will also lead to reinforcing the practice of caste-based occupations.||
16-09-2015||commentary||---------||Disentangling the Economics of Net Neutrality :||The debate around net neutrality in India has focused on safeguarding the rights and freedoms of using the internet, but little has been said about the economics of data transportation and pricing. This article argues that just like physical transportation companies charge more to carry the same weight of steel as compared to sand, internet service providers must be allowed to price discriminate as well. It also argues that apprehensions about price discrimination are essentially fears of monopolistic practices--a legitimate fear that must be addressed.||Vinod Kumar
16-09-2015||commentary||---------||Recalibrating Fiscal Deficit Numbers for India :||The fiscal deficit numbers are often managed in undesirable ways. This article recalibrates the fiscal deficit numbers for the combined finances of the centre and the states, and then for the centre in the last 10 years in which fiscal responsibility and budget management targets have been applicable. The analysis suggests an under-reporting of numbers and that the corrected fiscal deficit of the centre and states is actually higher by about 12% on an average.||Siddhartha K Rastogi

But if government policies favour the rich and systematically undermine the interests of the common people and their democratic rights, one cannot rule out institutions of the state--the bureaucracy with some help from the judiciary--administering another Emergency in one form or another.||K N Hari Kumar

With mining, states dispose of minerals for money, and have so far lost more than half their value. As this study shows, over the last eight years of iron ore mining in Goa, each family of four in the state has lost the equivalent of Rs 13.51 lakh, while the average Goan private household's assets are estimated to be Rs 10.44 lakh. This is catastrophic.||Rahul Basu

Although Maharashtra has been leading in the expansion of credit cooperatives, this has been marked by a distinct bias in favour of Western Maharashtra where cash crops, particularly sugar cane are grown. The process has largely eluded Eastern and Central Maharashtra, where cotton and other crops are grown.||Pallavi Chavan

These are evident in women's bargaining position in negotiating marriage. Whether daughter deficit increases violence against women or enhances their value depends on its interaction with development processes, gender inequality, and successful challenges to traditional gender norms.||Sharada Srinivasan

This article argues that the formation of Telangana opens the door for accepting the century-old demand of the Indian Gorkhas for a separate homeland. It also argues against the use of the term separatism to describe the demand of the Indian Gorkhas and instead suggest the terms "merger" and "demerger." Darjeeling, whose merger with West Bengal was, at best, a post-independence administrative exigency, could now be demerged, much like Telangana from Andhra Pradesh.||Bivek Tamang,Sangmu Thendup

But the government has decided to recapitalise PSBs--a sensible change of mind. India's recapitalisation cost since the mid-1990s must be amongst the lowest worldwide, and it has helped prevent a banking crisis. Other proposed reforms in Indradhanush follow the framework put forth by the P J Nayak Committee, but fall far short of the paradigm shift policies proposed therein.||T T Ram Mohan

Lata Mangeshkar's thin voice is assumed to have suited a particular vision of femininity promoted by Hindi films at the time. It is tempting to think that as their singing voices have thickened and acquired greater texture, female characters in Hindi films have similarly acquired greater agency, rebelliousness and independence. The reality, however, is very different.||Ashwini Deshpande
09-09-2015||special articles||---------||Science and Theories of Caste Origins : From Colonial Anthropometry to Contemporary Genetics||This article delineates three phases of scientific enquiry into caste origins and identifies a set of social and political agendas which were, and continue to be, affected by the results of those enquiries. It examines debates between colonial administrators which led to a "racial theory" of caste origins at the turn of the 19th century; various refutations of and modifications to the racial theory, largely by Indian scholars, in the 20th century; and contemporary genetic studies. It concludes that scientific studies of caste origins should be subject to particularly careful scrutiny in light of the social and political context in which their results are deployed.||Thomas Sebastian
09-09-2015||special articles||---------||Mergers and Acquisitions of Banks in Post-Reform India||A major perspective of the Reserve Bank of India's banking policy is to encourage competition, consolidate and restructure the system for financial stability. Mergers and acquisitions have emerged as one of the common methods of consolidation, restructuring and strengthening of banks. There are several theoretical justifications to analyse the M&A activities, like change in management, change in control, substantial acquisition, consolidation of the firms, merger or buyout of subsidiaries for size and efficiency, etc. The objective here is to examine the performance of banks after mergers. The hypothesis that there is no significant improvement after mergers is accepted in majority of cases--there are a few exceptions though. Therefore, the strategy of M&A to consolidate banks for purposes of efficiency seems flawed. Future banking policy must take note of this empirical reality and long-drawn experience of the past two decades.||

We attempt to estimate the non-linear relationship between inflation and economic growth for 54 developing countries over the 1971-2010 period. Our results suggest a positive association between inflation and gross domestic product growth up to a rough inflation threshold; we did this separately for Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, and Sub-Saharan Africa. The threshold rate of inflation is found to be 23.5% for Latin America and the Caribbean, approximately 11% for Asia, and 23.6% for Sub-Saharan Africa. These results have important policy implications for developing countries, which often struggle to find the right balance between low inflation and high economic growth.||Anupam Das,John Loxley

Far from being dead, it is argued that the agrarian question remains real to people's politics in the 21st century and will remain so, especially in the global South where rural movements are finding alternative ways to wrestle monopoly-finance capital that continues to run amok.||Paris Yeros,Praveen Jha,Sam Moyo

This article looks at the Indian diaspora in Africa and tries to understand how Indians of various castes responded to life there. It argues that caste has changed form in the new social and geographical context but it has not been eliminated. A majority of the Indian diaspora in Africa still looks to marry within caste and endorses caste identities. This article also touches upon Gandhi's role in organising Indians in South Africa and tries to interrogate his understanding of the caste scenario there.||Suraj Milind Yengde

03-09-2015||special articles||---------||Non-Food Expenditures and Consumption Inequality in India||This paper contributes to the ongoing debate about economic inequality in India during the post-reform period. It analyses consumption inequality through the hitherto neglected lens of non-food expenditure. Using household level consumption expenditure data from the quinquennial "thick" rounds of the National Sample Survey, the paper shows that inequality within food and non-food groups has declined, even as overall expenditure inequality has increased over time. The analysis suggests that the rise in overall expenditure inequality is due to the increased weight in the household budget of non-food spending, which tends to be more unequal than food spending. The paper also shows that inequality is very different across broad non-food items. Durables, education, healthcare, and consumer services show the most rapid increases in real expenditure, and also display the highest levels of inequality. Finally, the paper offers some possible mechanisms for this phenomenon and suggests policy measures to deal with this form of inequality.||

Court judgments between 1997 and 2006 relating to land acquisition for infrastructure projects such as NICE tell us about the new urban form, which the courts feel obliged to bring into being, displaying a proselytising zeal in promoting corridor urbanism. The corridor project has seized hold of the planning, bureaucratic, and judicial imagination in ways that signal a consensus about the imperatives of rapid capitalist growth, uncontaminated by any early postcolonial notions of developmentalist growth.||

These issues have, in turn, become embroiled in factional politics within the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party in New Delhi and in the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Chennai, which is currently out of power both in the centre and in Tamil Nadu.||Paranjoy Guha Thakurta
27-08-2015||special articles||---------||The Politics of Industry in Nehru's India :||The paper argues that at the time of independence Indian managing agencies, controlling most industrial firms and their associated enterprises, were in themselves embodiments of pre-industrial forms of capital accumulated through trading and moneylending. This militated against technological dynamism within the industrial firms because the managing agencies applied a profit-maximising calculus across their various business activities, rather than in relationship to any individual firm. The group structure, in fact, facilitated the leakage of surpluses generated in industrial activity into the parallel speculative and moneylending interests of the managing agents. After independence, the government's attempts to reform the industrial sector met resistance from politically influential businessmen who had supported the anti-colonial movement. The British government also interceded here. The social engineering that these reforms entailed, embodied in legislation, was thwarted by the combined pressures exerted by affected businessmen, but this should not prevent an appreciation of what the government was attempting.||Nasir Tyabji

Using Annual Survey of Industries data, estimates of TFP growth in Indian manufacturing industries during 1999-2000 to 2011-12 are presented. TFP estimation was done by constructing separate series on domestically procured and imported materials input. Productivity estimates obtained in the study indicate that TFP growth in manufacturing industries during 1999-2011 tends to get understated if imported materials are not separated out from domestically procured materials. For aggregate manufacturing, TFP estimates, corrected for aggregation bias, indicate that there was a rapid growth in productivity.||Bishwanath Goldar
27-08-2015||special articles||---------||Class Struggle, the Maoists and the Indigenous Question in Nepal and India :||This article compares the Maoist movements in Nepal and India, with a focus on their respective relationship to indigenous politics. The unprecedented rise of indigeneity and ethnicity in post-war Nepal was, in large part, a consequence of the Maoists' People's War, which paid special attention to the case of Nepal's Janajatis through, what we call here, the "indigenous question." In comparison, the Indian Maoists have paid less attention to the indigenous question than their Nepali counterparts, though they have created their guerrilla zones in Adivasi-dominated areas. While the Indian Maoists' relative lack of attention to the indigenous question creates a situation in which class struggle can be presented primarily as an Adivasi movement, the danger in Nepal is that the sole focus on identity has undermined more radical demands for state restructuring. In both cases, a limited politics based on rights for particular groups has had the effect of replacing broader--even international--struggles, which have the potential to address more fundamental socio-economic inequalities by challenging the dominant politics of production, reproduction and redistribution.||Alpa Shah,Feyzi Ismail

Nearly nine decades later, in Pathapally in India's youngest state, Telangana, a more than three-month-long struggle of the Madigas, a Dalit community, forced the administration to accept its demands. This article traces the events and developments of the Pathapally movement and compares it with its iconic predecessor.||Anand Teltumbde

21-08-2015||commentary||---------||Indian Exports : Loss of Global Competitiveness||A time series of exports indicates that average export growth has remained almost stagnant since January 2012 after a sharp bounce back in the first and second quarters of 2009. This article looks at the composition of India's export basket, export destinations and share in global exports to understand the reasons for the fall in export growth. It concludes that the evident inability to increase India's share in global markets points to the need for a thorough review of the working and performance of export promotion councils and related export agencies.||Geetima Das Krishna,Rajiv Kumar

19-08-2015||perspectives||---------||On Education :||One of the greatest unmet challenges of contemporary India has been education. The state has not been able to live up to its self-professed role of providing education to all. It is necessary, in a context of massive and rapid changes brought about by a globalising world and a transforming society, to reiterate the well known but oft-forgotten adage that education is, in essence, about opening up the student's mind to the riches of the universe.||Basudev Chatterji

The National Food Security Act, backed early on by the political leadership, enabled the state to include the bulk of the rural population in this improved system. However, there is still a long way to go in ensuring that the system is reliable, transparent and corruption-free.||Jean Dreze,Jessica Pudussery,Reetika Khera

This paper intends providing a starting point for a conversation on the law and policy dimensions of inter-sectoral water allocation. Focusing on a specific inter-sectoral water allocation conflict in Rajsamand District, Rajasthan, it illustrates gaps in the existing law and policy frameworks and highlights multiple issues that need to be addressed. It argues that the law must go beyond just prioritising water uses and water allocation to understand the issue in a comprehensive manner.||Lovleen Bhullar,Philippe Cullet,Sujith Koonan

By analysing the practices and problems associated with toilet use from a phenomenological perspective, this article aims to situate the issue in the everyday lives of women.||Aarushie Sharma,Asmita Aasaavari,Srishty Anand

14-08-2015||commentary||---------||Recent Trends in India's Merchandise Trade : Warning Signs for the Economy||The contraction of India's merchandise trade, both exports and imports, from December 2014 is a worrying development, even if it has led to a temporary improvement in trade balance. The substantial decline in international oil prices, and its direct impact on value of trade, explains this fall only partially. An analysis of the figures tends to confirm the persistence of industrial stagnation rather than a revival of growth in Indian manufacturing, and suggests that this tendency is being reinforced.||Surajit Mazumdar

One, the trends in morbidity rates and patterns of morbidity, two, the effectiveness of the public sector in ensuring access to healthcare, and three, the cost of healthcare across public and private sectors.||T Sundararaman,V R Muraleedharan

12-08-2015||perspectives||---------||Understanding Vyapam :||The Vyapam scam of Madhya Pradesh is not the familiar story of exam cheating. It is about the mutation of exam cheating into a service industry facilitated by the State. Understanding it requires a look at the political economy of a hollowed-out system of education. The scam found a congenial climate in the sociopolitical reality of Madhya Pradesh.||Krishna Kumar
12-08-2015||special articles||---------||Culture and Life of Government Elementary Schools :||Government elementary schools are layered institutions that are affected by a bureaucratic administration, the specificities of local societies, and the agency of teachers. Although promoted as an agency and institution of democracy, modernity and development, these schools are characterised by a thin democracy, both in their everyday culture and in their linkage to local communities. Routinisation of teaching-learning practices, training fatigue among teachers whose agency has been eroded, and programme overload result in learning loss among children. The average government elementary school represents both the promise and the perils of a mass elementary education system. In its effect on society, the government elementary school is neither reproductive nor transformative, but disjunctive.||A R Vasavi
12-08-2015||special articles||---------||Birth, Life and Death of Development Finance Institutions in India :||This essay traces the evolution of development finance institutions in India from conception and birth, soon after independence, through infancy to adulthood and maturity, followed by a winding down at the turn of the century and closure in the early 2000s. It highlights their macroeconomic significance, and their critical role in the financing of industrialisation from the 1970s to the 1990s, to analyse the factors underlying their decline. Their contribution to the provision of industrial finance was essential and innovative. Yet, there were serious errors of omission, such as exclusion of infrastructure, and absence of coordination with industrial policy. Instead of introducing correctives, the government shut down development banks, which was the most serious error of commission. These successes and failures carry lessons for other countries, just as India has as much to learn, about the continuing importance of finance for investment in manufacturing from countries that have done better at industrialisation.||Deepak Nayyar
12-08-2015||special articles||---------||Safe Abortion as a Women's Right : Perceptions of Law Enforcement Professionals||A study conducted among law enforcement officials in seven countries across Asia by the Asia Safe Abortion Partnership to measure the level of knowledge, attitude and awareness of women’s rights as well as safe and legal abortion shows lack of understanding about the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act and the subsequent amendments. Many lawyers believe that even if it did become a regular component of the law curriculum, there would be few takers, given the low potential for such cases in the practice. In the current environment, where the issue of implementation of the Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques Act tends to wrongly overshadow discussions on safe abortion and the MTP Act, these views are important as they affect the way safe abortion is perceived as a women’s right and have an impact on restriction or liberalisation of women’s access to safe abortion services.||Alka Barua,Hemant Apte,Suchitra Dalvie
14-08-2015||notes||---------||J F Duff and the University Education Commission of India, 1948-49 :||It has been a difficult period for university education in India, with the controversy around the four-year undergraduate programme joining the old complaints about lack of autonomy, political interference, financial ill-health, and deteriorating standards of academics and administration. In these times, the thoughts of one who was present at the conception of independent India's university structure and contributed to its making are a fascinating window into the state of affairs 65 years ago.||Rakesh Ankit

A Critical View on Intersectionality from India" (EPW, 25 April 2015) appreciate the article's attempt to initiate a debate on "intersectionality." The fi rst piece takes issues with Menon on rejecting intersectionality and argues that feminists should critically examine whether the concept offers any insights into their dilemmas and challenges. The second piece criticises Menon for not clarifying the issues she problematises. This piece also takes on Menon for a not-so-nuanced representation of the women's movement.||Mary E John

14-08-2015||economic notes||---------||Gross Value Added : Why Not the Double Deflation Method for Estimation?||To estimate gross value added for the manufacturing sector, the 2011-12 National Accounts Statistics series follows the "single deflation" instead of the "double deflation" method. In this note, it is argued that the double deflation method estimates come closer to the Index of Industrial Production growth estimates, and that this reinforces the view that gross value added of manufacturing is overestimated in the 2011-12 series. This has an impact on overall GDP growth numbers, which too end up lower than in the new series.||J Dennis Rajakumar,S L Shetty

This report called for an identification of the owners of Participatory Notes, the instruments used for a good part of foreign investment in the stock market. The history of P-note investment goes back to the early 1990s since when they have served as conduits for making illegitimate money legitimate and have defied half-hearted attempts at control and dismantling. Their importance may have come down but they are unlikely to be banned because the government fears investor exit.||
07-08-2015||commentary||---------||The Indian Financial Code : The Good, the Bad and the Ugly||The Government of India has gone against the spirit and content of the comprehensive recommendations of the 2013 report of the Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission. It has revised the commission's draft Indian Financial Code (which had its own pluses and minuses) with a second draft code which, among other things, will lead to a greater centralisation of powers with the government and a weakening of the independence of the Reserve Bank of India. This is best illustrated in the recommended composition and powers of the Monetary Policy Committee. The finance ministry cannot hide behind the claim that this is a draft code; the revised draft IFC has been drawn up within the ministry.||K Kanagasabapathy

But can these agencies bring forth a change in the mindset of the small farmers and seed savers' groups who view the current intellectual property regime with scepticism and continue to keep away from it?||Shalini Bhutani
07-08-2015||commentary||---------||Bringing Back Social Forestry :||India's social forestry programme promised much in the late-1970s and mid-1980s. It became the programme to be emulated for many developing countries. But the programme was not backed up by adequate research and was jettisoned, in the early 1990s. With climate change becoming a global concern, social forestry could make a comeback provided the policymakers learn from past mistakes.||Irshad A Khan

07-08-2015||perspectives||---------||India's Handloom Challenge : Anatomy of a Crisis||The Indian weaver is dismissed in high places as an embarrassing anachronism, despite demand for his or her skills and products. In the new millennium, globalisation and a mindless acquiescence to imported notions of a good life threaten to take over, even as the West looks East for better concepts of sustainable living. Analysing today's crisis in the handloom sector, plagued by low-cost imitations from power looms, this article points out that we are caught in a meaningless dichotomy that could damage Indian handloom's unique reputation of coming from a system unmatched for delivering genuine sustainability.||Ashoke Chatterjee
07-08-2015||special articles||---------||Growth and Inequality in the Distribution of India's Consumption Expenditure: 1983 to 2009-10 :||This paper undertakes an assessment of the evolution of inequality in the distribution of consumption expenditure in India over the last quarter-century, from 1983 to 2009-10, employing data available in the quinquennial "thick" surveys of the National Sample Survey Office. We find that plausible adjustments to the data, along with an emphasis on "centrist" rather than "rightist" or "leftist" inequality measures, lead to a picture of widening over-time inequality in the distribution of consumption expenditure, which is at odds with the impression of more or less unchanging inequality conveyed in some of the literature available on the subject in India.||D Jayaraj,S Subramanian
07-08-2015||special articles||---------||Why Women Teachers Matter in Secondary Education :||There have been plenty of policy recommendations and interventions to increase the pool of women teachers in India, especially at the school level. Despite this, research in three districts of Rajasthan shows that any such attempt would need an integrated and organic approach that builds bridges across the secondary, collegiate, and teacher-training levels. The paper points out that what is needed is a definite break from past practice to creatively re-conceptualise the education continuum, while putting forward some recommendations to lower barriers in the way of secondary education for girls in the state.||Kameshwari Jandhyala,Vimala Ramachandran
07-08-2015||special articles||---------||On the Question of Capital Punishment :||This paper examines the two basic types of ethical justification usually advanced in favour of capital punishment--those of deterrence and retribution. It contends that deterrence-oriented arguments, which fall under the rubric of utilitarianism, are questionable both on the grounds of their own consequentialist criterion--their supposed "utility" in producing a deterrent effect--as well as in terms of standard non-consequentialist (deontological) ethical theories. Through an analysis of retributivistic justifications of capital punishment, grounded in Kantian deontological ethics, the paper then points to a tension internal to the retributivistic conception of punishment. This te nsion brings to light a deeper moral sense inherent in retributivism, which provides normative grounds for opposing the death penalty.||Nishad Patnaik
07-08-2015||discussion||---------||Measuring Indian Growth : Why the Data Should Be Doubted Less||The article offers some explanations for the large changes in growth rates in the rebased gross domestic product series, but argues that these do not imply a recovery in the macroeconomic cycle. Changes in estimates of savings and investment also support these conclusions. In addition, firms were under pressure to save costs, and thereby growth of value added increased. This implies that industrial growth was constrained on the demand-side rather than the supply-side, while firms' balance sheets remained healthy.||Ashima Goyal

In its 10-year history, a key issue that has dominated the implementation of the act is access to bio resources and sharing its benefits. The government's new guidelines on access and benefit sharing notified in 2014 have only marginally added to what the act and its rules lay down. In addition, neither the intended beneficiaries nor readers of the document get much hint of the thought process behind the exercise.||Kanchi Kohli,Shalini Bhutani

31-07-2015||perspectives||---------||A Subaltern View of Climate Change :||In the context of the ongoing debate on climate change and the policies that nation states need to adopt to limit the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the author poses a relevant question: instead of asking what would happen to the world if everyone were to consume energy at the level of the rich "developed" American, we can now enquire why everyone is not consuming at the level of the above-poor "developing" Indian? He also suggests that the way the poor adapt, migrate and progress provides not just a sustainable approach to climate change but also one that addresses resource use.||Dunu Roy

But what if these deficits are being carried forward and sustained in higher education? This paper shows that the results of a survey conducted among postgraduate students of economics in an Indian university were very Pratham-like. The objective was to assess their understanding of basic arithmetic operations and some primary economic principles/indicators. Is it the case, particularly in the social sciences, that we are receiving and, in turn, churning out generations of students who lack an understanding of basic principles? If so, what are the institutional mechanisms in place to sustain this long continuum of ignorance?||Rohini Sahni,V Kalyan Shankar
31-07-2015||special articles||---------||Agrarian Performance and Food Price Inflation in India : Pre- and Post-Economic Liberalisation||Examining long-term trends in food inflation in India in relation to the performance of the Indian agricultural sector under various agrarian policy regimes, this paper shows that despite the slowdown in the agricultural sector and higher increases in the cost of food production during the post-economic reforms period (1992-2013), food prices were relatively low compared to the initial (1967-80) and the maturing (1980-92) stages of the Green Revolution. This, it is argued, is possibly due to more stable agricultural growth post 1991-92, higher buffer food stocks, greater coverage of the public distribution system, and better responses to food price fluctuations due to import/trade liberalisation and a more comfortable foreign exchange reserves position.||Leena Mary Eapen,Sthanu R Nair
31-07-2015||special articles||---------||Tristão Bragança Cunha and Nationalism in Colonial Goa :||Unlike other Indian nationalists, the Goan nationalist Tristão Bragança Cunha did not attempt to create a monolithic nationalist formation, he celebrated hybridisation instead. Bragança was involved in detaching the idea of the Indian nation from Indological traits, but was also caught up in stressing Goa’s cultural affinity with India and went on to impose India on Goa. The strategy may seem contradictory when viewed through the prism of a standard view of nationalism, it does, however, constitute a crucial position through which the Catholic nationalists in Goa were coming to terms with self-representation. Brought up as a Catholic and entangled in an identity crisis, Bragança Cunha was a precursor of the postcolonial theorists who later developed the sophisticated arguments of the “mimic man.” By examining the life and work of Bragança Cunha, this article analyses a type of nationalism that emerged against the background of Portuguese colonialism, a nationalism that challenges the singularity of nationalist imaginations.||Parag D Parobo

Parsi food has a prominent place in the cultural landscape of the city, and travel guides and reviews insist "authentic" Parsi cuisine is a part of the "Bombay experience." In a time of declining numbers and cultural changes brought about by globalisation, today's Parsi cuisine enables the construction and imagination of a Parsi identity where authenticity is redefi ned over time through circuits of different culinary endeavours.||Anirudh Raghavan,Syeda Asia,Vanshika Singh
31-07-2015||notes||---------||World of the Third :||Recent analyses of the discursive exclusion of the "world of the third" from the development discourse are theoretically acute and provoke one to rethink postcoloniality. These constitute the rich literature on India's postcolonial experience and can be traced from Subaltern Studies, which adopted a distinctly structural approach. The recent interventions adopt a modifi ed Lacanian frame where the theoretical focus is on foreclosure and foregrounding. The substantive contention is that major population segments of the now poor countries have been dislocated physically through and discursively in the course of modernisation and globalisation. Development theory has tried to include the dislocated through its inclusive development programmes. The included "Third World" is however a denigrated representation of the actual. Its emancipation can come through alternately imagining itself.||Pranab Kanti Basu

23-07-2015||perspectives||---------||Achilles' Heel of Public Policy : Information and Limited Institutions Capacity||An inadequate information base and limited institutional capacity for policy formulation seem to be important factors constraining India's public policy pursuits. A look at the major recommendations of the Report of the High Level Committee on Reorienting the Role and Restructuring of Food Corporation of India illustrates that this has not changed in more than six decades of independence. Though a good understanding of the issue is essential for any policy formulation to be effective, an evaluation shows that there are good reasons to be sceptical about the committee's comprehension of issues, methods and interpretations.||M H Suryanarayana
23-07-2015||special articles||---------||Appraising the Debate on Biodiversity Conservation in the Western Ghats :||This critical review and comparison of the Gadgil and Kasturirangan panel reports on the Western Ghats highlights various concerns related to their methodology, recommendations, and the manner in which they resolve the contradictions between the imperatives of environmental protection and economic development. It also focuses on basic demographic data on the affected areas in the Western Ghats, statistics on agricultural land use, and occupation data of the affected population in the ecologically sensitive zones, none of which has been considered in the two reports. The paper argues that the constitution of expert panels for the Western Ghats is an attempt to appeal to the principles of scientific certainty for addressing the dual concerns of environment and development. The two reports have an unwitting common ground: while they are alive to environmental concerns, they ignore insights from development theory and practice. The recommendations of both the reports presume that environmental and developmental imperatives can be combined without a political debate.||Aravindhan Nagarajan,Goutham Radhakrishnan,Kamal K Murari,T Jayaraman

The colonial and postcolonial states are external actors that have restructured the society. They have reconstituted it ideologically, culturally as well as geographically. The three are interdependent: a geographical upheaval is always followed by ideological and cultural changes. Changes in land relations lead to a redefinition of identity. This is not necessarily due to physical changes in the landscape but a result of the ideological upheaval accompanying such change. This article will examine such changes while exploring the issue of land rights of the Kukis and their contentious negotiations with the colonial and postcolonial states.||Hoineilhing Sitlhou

In spite of some positive features, the bill's aversion to the rights of workers and trade unions is quite apparent. For instance, penalties are imposed on individual workers for illegal strikes, but for illegal lockouts, the fine is borne by a collective entity; this is but one of many unequal provisions.||Sharit K Bhowmik

16-07-2015||perspectives||---------||Macroeconomic Aspects of Goods and Services Tax :||The introduction of the goods and services tax may indeed be the biggest reform of taxation so far, but the proposal, as it stands, has led to confusion. Certainly, the myriad taxes producers face will be simplified. But the benefit will go to large-scale producers while the small-scale ones will be at a greater disadvantage than before. The cascading effect will be reduced but not eliminated. With resort to revenue neutrality, prices and costs will not decline. A "revenue neutral rate" will, however, be difficult to calculate and will be controversial, given the variety of taxes being replaced. The adoption of a fixed revenue neutral rate for all stages of production and distribution will lead to a rise in the prices of basic and intermediate goods, as also of services, making the introduction of GST inflationary, unless this problem is specifically addressed.||Arun Kumar
16-07-2015||special articles||---------||India and the Neglected Development Dimensions of Bretton Woods :||This paper helps correct two common misconceptions about the origins of the Bretton Woods institutions. The first is that the negotiations were primarily an Anglo-American affair in which developing countries had little input. The second is that international development issues were largely ignored during the negotiations. This examination of India's role in the origins of Bretton Woods shows that both assumptions are flawed. Understanding the history of the birth of the Bretton Woods institutions in a more accurate way provides a useful perspective for contemporary debates about their future.||Eric Helleiner
16-07-2015||special articles||---------||Murky Waters of Medical Practice in India : Ethics, Economics and Politics of Healthcare||Pervasive greed in contemporary medical practice does not spare even the poorest of the patients. Medical expenses are now considered one of the major triggers of impoverishment in the country. A rapid influx of advanced technologies in areas ranging from drug discovery to diagnostics has generated a greater reliance on assistive technology by the practitioners of modern, Western medicine transforming patients into cases and physicians into technocrats. This paper is a contribution to the ongoing debate on the quality and standards of medical practice in India. It challenges the argument that markets can bring out the optimum in healthcare and shows how market forces have, in fact, militated against patient interests.||Sumit Mazumdar

Since nearly 95% of the students in Urdu schools in Maharashtra belong to a deprived religious minority, it also adversely affects the community's overall representation in the public and private sectors.||Abdul Shaban

But, as an editorial in their mouthpiece, Organiser, justifying the Ministry of Human Resource Development-foisted "derecognition" of the Ambedkar-Periyar Study Circle at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, reveals, they cannot tolerate his radical views. Ambedkar had a difficult relationship with the Indian communists, but he did not disagree with the goals of Marxism. Ambedkar also made clear his critical views on Hinduism. It is therefore far-fetched for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh to claim that Ambedkar was an anti-red and pro-saffron personality.||Anand Teltumbde

The proportion of male cattle has declined sharply as farmers do not fi nd it worthwhile to maintain bullocks to plough holdings that are becoming smaller and smaller. The composition of the milch cattle population too is changing. The proportion of the indigenous breed is falling and that of the exotic/cross-bred is growing.

09-07-2015||perspectives||---------||Unconstitutionality of Anti-Terror Laws : The Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime Bill, 2015||The Gujarat Control of Terrorism and Organised Crime Bill, 2015 does more than violate fundamental civil liberties; it is a dangerous instance of the state transgressing the constitutional limits of its lawmaking powers. The federal distribution of powers between the centre and states under the Constitution ensures that only Parliament can legislate on matters such as terrorism that relate to the security or sovereignty of the nation. States cannot arrogate this power to themselves by devising harsh anti-terror laws that apply only within their respective territories. The unconstitutionality of the Gujarat Bill is not just a sum of its numerous illegal parts, but rooted in a deeper, more fundamental failing, namely, that the Gujarat assembly did not have the power to pass such a law in the fi rst place.||Aarthi Rajan,Alok Prasanna Kumar

The study finds that four distinct outcomes explain why both agents and clients trust these systems. They are the clients' potential to save in their home bank accounts through remittances; the clients' attraction to the product; employers creating a sub-ecosystem of mobile money by remitting money on behalf of clients; and messages that clients receive on transfer of money. The paper also proposes a model for financial inclusion of migrant workers, which is a revenue model for mobile operators as well.||Lakshmi Kumar,Swati Dutta

China was able to realise the potential benefits of its demographic dividend by prudent reforms in technical, vocational education and training system. Policymakers in India are grappling with a similar set of constraints and it is crucial to undertake critical reforms in our skill development ecosystem to be able to realise the demographic dividend that is available till about 2040. The Chinese system, its major features, the periodic reforms undertaken, its financing, and the participation of industry, are discussed here. Further, the similarities and distinctions with the Indian system are highlighted along with key lessons from the Chinese experience.||A Kamaladevi,Ankita Gandhi,Santosh Mehrotra

Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar's statement about using terrorists to neutralise terrorists has inevitably got linked to the situation, bringing back hoary memories of the mid-1990s, when the counter-insurgency group Ikhwan-ul-Muslimoon became a law unto itself.

It suffers from the vice of arbitrariness as there is no way to determine who an "eminent person" is. The veto powers given to any two members also make it susceptible to misuse. Finally, there are concerns about maintaining the independence of the judiciary because the high courts and the Supreme Court examine the validity of actions taken by the executive branch as well as the legislature.||C Raj Kumar,Khagesh Gautam
30-06-2015||housing discrimination||---------||Urban Rental Housing Market : Caste and Religion Matters in Access||This study attempts to identify the forms of discrimination experienced by Dalits and Muslims in the rental housing market in five metropolitan areas of the National Capital Region of Delhi. A combination of three distinct methods, the telephonic audit, in-person or face-to-face audit, and studies, is used to capture the phenomenon of discrimination and unequal outcomes for prospective Dalit and Muslim tenants in the urban rental housing market. The study finds that houseowner prejudices deny housing for both Dalits and Muslims, with Muslims experiencing greater discrimination. The study also found that Dalits and Muslims who manage to get homes on rent have to do so by agreeing to unfair terms and conditions.||Anuradha Banerjee,Firdaus Rizvi,Sukhadeo Thorat,Vinod K Mishra
30-06-2015||housing discrimination||---------||In Search of Fraternity : Constitutional Law and the Context of Housing Discrimination in India||The paper begins by acknowledging that scholarship in India has neglected the concept of fraternity for a long time, though today research in other parts of the world seeks to locate it either on the side of "horizontal solidarity" or in congruity with the value of "justice." In India, fraternity has been mentioned recently in law but has not yet been given much attention by the social sciences. This paper argues that in the Constituent Assembly, members sought to give specific content to the term fraternity, appropriate to the Indian context. The Supreme Court has subsequently made use of the concept in particular cases. The paper goes on to argue that there are possibilities for giving fraternity purchase in the context of an area, currently very controversial-- that of religion-based housing discrimination--though the Supreme Court held back from applying fundamental rights and constitutional principles in a relevant case in 2005. For such an argument to be made, however, a careful understanding of the way in which law and constitutional jurisprudence work is necessary.||Rowena Robinson

Using the case of the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company and the available documentation, these barriers have been classified as financial, technical and operational; for each, a possible solution is suggested. The study also identifies conditions that would be sufficient for integrated resource planning to be practised, including providing at least a specified level of electricity services, and minimising costs, environmental impacts and additional investments.||antonette D'sa
30-06-2015||special articles||---------||Women at Risk in the Unregulated Surrogacy 'Industry' : Evidence from a Study of Commercial Surrogates in Kolkata||In recent times India has become a haven for commercial surrogacy, a controversial assisted reproductive technology. Acute poverty means that there are always women ready to rent their wombs. But lack of laws and regulations means there is no transparency in the business of surrogacy and the surrogate mothers are prone to exploitation. The Assisted Reproductive Technology Bill 2013 aims to mend matters. This exploratory study conducted in Kolkata brings to light challenges that any legislation dealing with surrogacy must address. It shows how poor women who rent their wombs for money--ignoring social stigma, health hazards, fear and mental stress--are vulnerable to exploitation.||Ritika Mukherjee,T V Sekher

The study highlights the import-intensive nature of the industry, identifies skill gaps and infrastructural constraints faced especially by medium- and small-scale manufacturers.||Madhuri Saripalle

In practice, the rural-urban divide is more accurately characterised as a rural-urban gradation. Labour market outcomes vary along this gradation. Not integrating the gradation in our data and analysis leads to important loss of granularity and can yield misleading conclusions, a point we illustrate with the decline in female labour force participation.||Martín Rama,Rinku Murgai,Urmila Chatterjee
29-06-2015||review of rural affairs||---------||Debt Bondage and the Tricks of Capital :||Migrant labourers, free from rural bondage, are now bonded to other sources of debt, contracted from the agro-industry or construction sectors. The flows of migration in the brick-making and sugar cane sectors in Tamil Nadu, where bondage coexists with many public welfare schemes, illustrate the persistence and renewal of this phenomenon. The welfare schemes play the role of a safety net, but also contribute to low wages, and impunity on the part of employers. Alliances between capital and the state, through the politicisation of employers, are instrumental in the continuation of all forms of labour exploitation. When workers resist, employers tighten working conditions and start recruiting migrants from North India. And even if these forms of labour management obey a capitalist logic, they are inseparable from the caste hierarchy.||G Venkatasubramanian,Isabelle Guérin,S Kumar
29-06-2015||review of rural affairs||---------||Forced Migration of Labourers to Brick Kilns in Uttar Pradesh : An Exploratory Analysis||Seasonal employment in the rural economy at a wage rate below subsistence level forces underprivileged labourers to migrate for survival. Brick kilns in India are a major destination for migrant labourers, who are tied to them for the production season after accepting advance wages from agents. Based on the livelihood conditions of the migrant labourers and their indebtedness, this paper points out these migrations have to be seen as forced. The labourers remain in inter-kiln circulation, but are prevented from moving on because of their limited skills and social networks. They return home to repay a never-ending debt and again receive advance wages for the next season--renewing a cycle of debt and migration for survival.||Bhaskar Majumder

The majority of them are concentrated in stone and marble quarries, living on the edge of poverty, earning irregular incomes, and with poor access to services and utilities. Considering the likely numbers involved and their vulnerability, the paper suggests that mining and quarrying households should receive better policy attention.||

The returns to water management technologies range from 15% to 25% (average 21%) at the research station level, compared to 9% to 14% at the farm level (average 10.8%). Given the current rate of adoption and rate of return, the success rate of the water management technologies is only about 12%. There is therefore an urgent need to address the gaps in technology transfer and performance.||D Suresh Kumar,G Kar,K Palanisami,Kadiri Mohan,R P S Malik,S Raman

18-06-2015||special articles||---------||Ebola Virus Disease : Medical Ethics in a Public Health Emergency||The Ebola virus disease, which spread in four West African countries, brought to light the feeble health governance system not only in these countries but also at the global level. Weak health infrastructure, resource crunch, non-viability of preventive and curative medication, and distrust of foreign interventions among people not only aggravated the crisis but also led to a schizophrenic portrayal of the disease across the world. A lack of any preventive medication for Ebola--despite a history of recurrence over the last four decades--is a big question confronting health research communities, pharmaceutical companies and global health governing agencies. The recent outbreak of Ebola and a global security threat perception associated with the disease have given rise to many debates, one of them being the debate on medical ethics in a public health emergency. All the ethical issues related with the unavailability of medication, launch of untested medicine in affected areas and also the delay in decision-making and response are the core arguments which this article tries to analyse.||Pallavi Mishra
18-06-2015||special articles||---------||Workers' Lives, Walmart's Pocket : Garments’ Global Chain, from Savar to New York||In its spatial expansion, capital has globalised the production and distribution chain. The division of labour has been restructured throughout the world, factories have shifted from North to South, structural unemployment has increased in the North and cheap labour has been exploited to the hilt in the South. Bangladesh has thereby become the second-largest ready-made garment exporter in the world after China, supplying garments to major Western clothing brands. On 24 April 2013, the collapse of Rana Plaza that housed five garment factories killed at least 1,134 workers and injured many more. It exposed the vulnerability of the industry as well as the global lack of responsibility and accountability. This article investigates the global chain of the industry in order to understand the linkages between the lives of workers in the South and the profits of the monopolies of the North. The article also makes an attempt to understand the roles played by the local and global profiteers in the supply chain.||Anu Muhammad

If we take just agriculture, there is so much of the outside world that comes in not just as external markets but as external inputs. Further, many of our villages barely qualify as rural if we were to take occupation alone. So the earlier line that separated the farmer from the worker in towns is slowly getting erased. By now agriculturists are ready to accept that their future lies elsewhere, perhaps in cities and towns, perhaps also in household and informal industries. If they cannot make it to those places, at least their children should.||Dipankar Gupta

04-06-2015||special articles||---------||From Master Plans to City Development Strategies :||Up to the 20th century, city self-government and self-financing was historically the norm. Then both a major slump and two world wars impelled in Europe the centralisation of government powers in national states. It was this degree of centralisation, which was inherited by the former colonial dependencies, the newly independent countries, in the 1950s and 1960s. Those countries faced unprecedented levels of urbanisation and unmanageable concentrations of population. This led governments and aid agencies to emphasise rural development (to discourage outmigration to the cities), population redistribution and industrial decentralisation. However, a different tradition stressed the economic importance of raising productivity in cities through the concentration of population and resources. This study analyses the great journey from historical master plans to city development strategies.||Nigel Harris
04-06-2015||special articles||---------||Where Have All the Workers Gone? : Puzzle of Declining Labour Intensity in Organised Indian Manufacturing||India's post-reform economic development has seen a sustained decline in the labour intensity of the organised manufacturing sector, including in labour-intensive industries. This paper argues that this occurred due to an increase in the real wage to rental price of capital ratio, which, in turn, was mostly due to a fall in the relative price of capital goods. The decrease was driven by trade reforms in capital goods, and falling import tariffs on capital goods. While a fall in the relative price of capital may have led to an increase in the rate of private fixed investment in machines, and consequently, economic growth, one inadvertent consequence of the trade reforms was that they disincentivised firms from hiring labour.||Deb Kusum Das,Kunal Sen

Food price inflation and the fiscal deficit are consistently significant in dynamic panel regressions, with the effect of the first three times larger. More than the spread of employment insurance, overreaction to high food prices raised wages. Productivity increased in agriculture but less than in other sectors. The results support psychological causal factors alongside cyclical ones.||Akash Kumar Baikar,Ashima Goyal

It is claimed in diverse situations every day by everyone against other people, society and the state. Traditionally traced to classical liberalism's public-private divide, there are now several theoretical conceptions of privacy that collaborate and sometimes contend. Indian privacy law is evolving in response to four types of privacy claims: against the press, against state surveillance, for decisional autonomy and in relation to personal information. The Supreme Court has selectively borrowed competing foreign privacy norms, primarily American, to create an unconvincing pastiche of privacy law in India. These developments are undermined by a lack of theoretical clarity and the continuing tension between individual freedoms and communitarian values.||Bhairav Acharya
28-05-2015||review of urban affairs||---------||Data, Urbanisation and the City||By using the enormous processing capacity of computing that is now available, we can, it is claimed, improve how cities are governed--make them smart! This review attempts to illuminate how data reveals relationships between citizens and the state and thus facilitates an informed debate on whether data can be deployed to build a more inclusive and constructive relationship between citizens and their government. As urbanisation deepens, we see struggles around who gets to decide what is to be governed and how the data is to be collected and deployed and what technologies and skills are to be deployed for implementation. The papers in this collection can be viewed in three groups, respectively, dealing with three issues: data collection processes, intra-urban spatial inequities and use of new sensing technologies.||Anant Maringanti,Partha Mukhopadhyay

They also critically affect urban policies, especially in large metropolitan cities where intra-urban differences can be of very large magnitudes. Gaining insights from recently released ward-level census data for urban settlements, this paper uses a set of constructed indices and geospatial maps to focus on spatial inequality within cities and across scales of settlements. Arguing that the slum is not a proxy for urban poverty and inadequate housing patterns, it underscores the need for newer methods to spatially trace multidimensional urban poverty and vulnerability.||Arindam Jana,Gautam Bhan

Further, in the case of some cities covered in the study, the proportion of Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes in wards is highly correlated with access to public, private, and luxury goods.||Pranav Sidhwani

Ward-level Population Enumeration Data, and Houselisting and Housing Census Data from the 2011 Census is here used to construct sub-city typologies for Bengaluru. Nine variables from the census are selected to represent three broad classes of attributes for each ward--housing conditions, availability of amenities, and socio-economic status. Hierarchical and non-hierarchical cluster analysis methods are then used to delineate empirical typologies. The results indicate that a four-cluster solution may provide a useful typological classification of Bengaluru wards. The utility and limitations of such an approach are also discussed.||Krishnachandran Balakrishnan,Shriya Anand

There is a need to closely analyse the way in which such surveys are carried out, the data that are collected, and the purposes for which they might be used. A review of the legal frameworks on slum surveying and the case of Delhi reveal that there is much variation in the process of data collection. Surveys that determine the mode of rehabilitation of a slum have life-changing implications for residents, and survey processes have to be accurate and participative.||Shahana Sheikh,Subhadra Banda
28-05-2015||special articles||---------||Estimates and Analysis of Farm Income in India, 1983-84 to 2011-12 :||This paper presents estimates of farmers' incomes from agriculture over the past three decades. The income earned by farmers from agricultural activities after paying for input costs and the wages for hired labour has seen low to high growth in different periods during the last three decades. In none of the periods do farmers' income or profitability of farming show any squeeze. The pace of growth in farmers' income that began around 2004-05, which reduced the disparity in growth in incomes of farmers and non-farmers, could not be sustained after 2011-12. It looks like the growth in farm income after 2011-12 has plummeted to around 1%, and this is an important reason for the sudden rise in agrarian distress in recent years.||Raka Saxena,Ramesh Chand,Simmi Rana
29-05-2015||special articles||---------||From Primitive Accumulation to Regimes of Dispossession : Six Theses on India’s Land Question||Existing theoretical perspectives, whether Marx's primitive accumulation or Harvey's accumulation by dispossession, are not adequate for understanding the political economy of land dispossession under capitalism--in India or elsewhere. This paper advances the concept of "regimes of dispossession" as a better way of understanding how dispossession is politically organised in different socio-historical contexts to serve different class interests with variable economic effects and political "success." The land-grabs of the neo-liberal period in India represent the emergence of a new regime of redistributing landed wealth upwards, one that is demonstrably less "developmental" than its Nehruvian predecessor--and certainly more politically tenuous. The paper shows how the concept of regimes of dispossession aids in a better understanding of (i) the relationship between land-grabs and specific historical phases of capitalism, and (ii) India's contemporary land question.||Michael Levien

There is, however, evidence that the growth rate in real gross value added of manufacturing in 2013-14 was probably about 5% or higher though it was reported as a negative 0.7% in the previous NAS series. Since manufacturing accounts for about 18% of GDP, more than half of the hike in the growth rate for 2013-14 between the two NAS series can therefore be explained in terms of a required correction in industrial growth rate estimates.||Bishwanath Goldar

But unlike the Thirteenth Finance Commission the FFC has not bothered to estimate the impact of the Goods and Services Tax and disinvestment proceeds on gross domestic product as well as fiscal space. The discontinuation of the practice of giving special weight to a Fiscal Discipline Index, started by the Eleventh Finance Commission is an unwelcome development.

15-05-2015||perspectives||---------||Reforming Labour Markets in States : Revisiting the Futility Thesis||Presenting a critical review of the issues in labour market reforms in India, this article places them against the backdrop of trends in labour force participation and formal/informal employment in the organised/unorganised sectors. Critically assessing the theoretical literature on labour market flexibility in the advanced economies, discussions in the Government of India's Economic Survey and the evidence in India, it asks if the reforms aimed at making the labour market more flexible will succeed in raising the economic growth rate and generating more employment, as advocates of labour market reform would have us believe.||Achin Chakraborty
14-05-2015||special articles||---------||Politics and Democracy in Our Time : Terms of Analysis||A shift from policies to that of the politics of the distribution of power and privilege in societies may bring with it recognition of the entirely new ethos of nationalism and democracy in our times. This article begins with this changed ethos by invoking that politics, and especially, a politics of indifference. It deals with two dimensions of the rule of indifference, beginning with the matter of difference as pluralism, and then turning to the issue of lack of sympathy with the here and now, the present generation, those living through the uprooting and displacement of diverse projects of "development." It should become clear from what follows that these two senses of the term, and the practices flowing from them, feed on each other, even if they appear in rather different guises and seem to be directed at very different kinds of objects.||Gyanendra Pandey
14-05-2015||special articles||---------||Trade in the Creative Sector : Comparing India with China, Brazil, and UK||Creative industries have become an important source of economic growth and international trade in recent years. India is one of the leading exporters of creative goods and services, and ranks fourth in terms of value of exports at the global level. However, the value of Indian exports is significantly lower than China's. Rising imports of creative goods and services to India also indicate an emerging and vibrant domestic market. However, unlike China, Brazil and the UK, India lacks an integrated policy framework for the creative sector. A coherent and informed policy could provide new opportunities to millions of traditional artisans and workers, and stimulate economic growth.||Abdul Shaban,Filip Vermeylen

The ways in which law weaves into and through creative writing as also the ways in which literary criticism and literary debates crosspollinate ideas of law, consciously or implicitly, need to be better understood. Where does justice figure in relation to law in literature? Do literatures constitute the commons? And what are the boundaries and limits of literary commons, and who are the keepers of these boundaries?||Kalpana Kannabiran

The Congress has often chosen to ignore those deeper reasons for its recent decline. Similarly, the failure of the Congress as also its possible strengths become evident only when we disaggregate the decline of the party state-wise. This leads to a curious but useful pointer-- the party may have to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party in states where it is locked in a bipolar contest with the BJP in order to create political space for itself. Above all, this paper argues that more than the leadership issue, the factors responsible for the decline of the Congress are the organisational neglect and complete abdication of politics. The paper then maps the challenges and limitations facing the Congress, particularly in its third life, the phase of survival.||Suhas Palshikar

Economies have become global. But politics remains national. This essay explores the relationship between globalisation and democracy, which is neither linear nor characterised by structural rigidities. It seeks to analyse how globalisation might constrain degrees of freedom for nation states and space for democratic politics, and how political democracy within countries might exercise some checks and balances on markets and globalisation. The essential argument is that the relationship between globalisation and democracy is dialectical and does not conform to ideological caricatures.||Deepak Nayyar
07-05-2015||special articles||---------||Contingent Convertibles and Bankers' Pay : The Missing Link in India’s Financial Regulation||The compensation practices at large financial institutions are often held as one of the important factors which contributed to the 2007/2008 global financial crisis. Regulators around the world, including India, have therefore moved to enact prescriptions aimed at increasing shareholder oversight of executive pay. Set against this background, the paper makes two novel proposals focusing on the Indian context. First, it nudges the regulators to prescribe creditor-centric compensation rules at banks. The Reserve Bank of India has hitherto focused on pay reforms that will promote incentive alignment between executives and shareholders. This paper argues that such reforms are likely to promote more rather than less risk-taking among bank executives. Second, it argues that the RBI ought to mandate banks to pay a substantial portion of the managerial compensation in contingent capital bonds. The design of these bonds can significantly motivate executives to "think like creditors" and thereby enable avoidance of taxpayer-funded bailouts.||Aadhaar Verma,Mandar Kagade

Turning to accounts of mediated Hindu nationalism, which have provided the bulk of writings on contested religion in India, it argues that the lack of a comparative literature on mediations in minority religions remains a major gap. It concludes with an assessment of new writings on the contested nature of media, religion, and culture in relation to Islam and Christianity in India.||Pradip Thomas

To retain the integrity of the original exercise, the same indicators examined by Bose have been analysed, as far as possible.

Does intersectionality as a universal framework help us to capture this complexity? This paper argues that it does not. It addresses this question through the intricacies of the terrain that feminist politics must negotiate, using the Indian experience to set up conversations with feminist debates and experiences globally. Feminism is heterogeneous and internally differentiated. We need to pay attention to challenges to the stability of given identities-- including those of "individual" and "woman." These challenges constitute the radically subversive moments that are likely to be most productive for feminism in the 21st century.||Nivedita Menon

24-04-2015||review of women's studies||---------||Navigating a Field of Opposition : A Rereading of Debates on ‘Caste and Gender’||This paper attempts to think through an impasse in the field of feminist scholarship and activism in India, one that has been perceived and analysed by many feminist scholars in the last few years. This seeming impasse pertains to the "caste and gender" relationship, which has produced a field of opposition on questions related to sexual labour and sexualised representation. The focus of the study is on the figure of the bar dancer and the devadasi, and the continuing debates on their practice or the systems they are located in, to argue that this false field of opposition is created by a growing separation between legal and social reform and the consequent erasure of social histories of caste in moments that are overdetermined by the law. This paper, therefore, advocates a return to thinking through questions of consent, agency and freedom through the realm of social practice and history.||Nitya Vasudevan

24-04-2015||review of women's studies||---------||Risking Feminism? : Voices from the Classroom||This paper is a classroom ethnography that engages with urban, middle-class narratives on feminism by young women. For them, their feminism is often precarious because it places possible heterosexual romance at risk by marking them as apparently anti-men. Further, it tends to place them in antagonistic relationships with their families, compelling them to engage in various strategies of negotiation, subversion and rebellion. This paper examines their understanding of both possible heterosexual relationships and the complex negotiations with families. Reflecting on these narratives, it argues that young women feminists today are taking risks, asking difficult questions, critically evaluating their own location and subject positions in their engagement with a feminist politics and practice.||Shilpa Phadke

Through examining three significant online activities in China since 2012, this paper explores how feminists have made the social media, especially Weibo, their new stage for feminist activities that are different from the traditional ones and that are able to provoke heated discussions among both the public and the mainstream media. Through Weibo and the other social media, grass-roots feminists have opened up a new bottom-up mode of activism different from the dominant top-down paradigm prevalent since the 1980s.||Holly Lixian Hou
24-04-2015||review of women's studies||---------||The Selfie and the Slut : Bodies, Technology and Public Shame||The selfie, which has become a default aesthetic of self-representation, is either mocked at as a fad, or considered as a digital photograph. This paper looks at the phenomenon of "selfie-shaming" to see how either of these approaches of dismissal or trying to regulate the selfie through the same regulatory frameworks as the photograph fail to capture the complex practices of body, technology, control, and regulation that are implicated in this phenomenon. In looking at selfie-shaming and the subsequent processes of "slut shaming", it argues that we need to think of selfies not only as cultural artefacts but also as born digital objects to show how it produces new regimes of control and visibility of women's bodies online. Drawing from software studies, cyber-feminism and digital cultures, it constructs the case of #GamerGate to show how we need to expand the scope of women's problems of consent and agency online beyond the instances of revenge and non-consensual pornography.||Nishant Shah

This policy seems to suggest that strategic purchasing of curative health services from both the public and private sectors can enable India to achieve the goal of "universal healthcare." The draft policy is based on two assumptions. One, policy interventions since the National Health Policy 2002 have been largely successful and two, there is harmony of purpose between public and private healthcare delivery systems which allows the private sector to be used for achieving public health goals. This article argues that these assumptions are flawed, highlights the various contradictions in the policy and cautions against over-optimism on publicly-financed health insurance schemes.||Mohan Rao,Prachin Godajkar,Rajib Dasgupta,Rama Baru,Ramila Bisht,Ritu Priya Mehrotra,Sunita Reddy,Vikas Bajpai

What is included and what is excluded in a textbook indicates the ideology and the aims of the textbooks, whether the aims are stated or unstated. The questions are: Which ideology? Which aims? Some excerpts from the present NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) textbooks indicate unstated aims of facilitating students' conformation and integration into the present social system. This is indicated by the use--and absence--of terms and concepts such as "capitalism" in these textbooks. Apparently the unstated aim is that if capitalism remains un-understood and unanalysed, it may not be questioned, and students will not realise that there is any alternative to capitalism. In the present circumstances, what can a textbook maker who stands on the left do?||Karen Haydock

16-04-2015||special articles||---------||Capitalisation of Nature : Political Economy of Forest/Biodiversity Offsets||Trading in environmental commodities like various forms of "offsets" has started with its questionable premise that any loss or damage to environment at a particular space-time can be offset by a supposedly pro-environmental action in another space-time through the mediation of capital and market. In India, a rather disguised offset process known as compensatory afforestation has taken off under state and judicial patronage quite some time ago. Besides, India also has the strong credential of having hosted a more common form of offset trading in the Clean Development Mechanism. Referring briefly to both but discussing mainly the philosophy and practices of various forms of offset markets in vogue, this article tries to show that this concept is in sync with the evolution of capital and capitalism in history.||Soumitra Ghosh
16-04-2015||special articles||---------||Democracy and Identity Politics in India: Is It a Snake or a Rope? :||The politics of recognition has dual effects while empowering marginal communities during democratic participation in India. On the one hand, identity politics provides democratic empowerment to a few communities or specific sections of communities, while, on the other, it disempowers people of the same communities who are not yet able to understand the language of democratic state and lag behind in creating group visibility. Thus, identity politics in democracy includes a few and excludes some others, while it is fuelled by tendencies of inclusive exclusion. Through a case study of Chamars in Uttar Pradesh, a low Dalit caste that has now been politically empowered, this paper shows how identity politics alone cannot handle horizontal inequalities among marginal groups.||Badri Narayan

By subjecting data contained in his survey to rigorous analytical study, estimates of agricultural productivity in terms of per capita grain output for two regions in Southern India; the erstwhile Mysore state and South Canara district can be obtained. Given that reliable estimates of agricultural productivity for the pre-1800 period outside of North-West Europe are relatively sparse, the present study adds to the archive of known estimates of agricultural productivity so as to enable comparative studies of economic performance. Moreover, since agricultural productivity had a direct bearing on the standard of living in medieval and early modern economies, the findings of this paper have important implications for India's position in the Great Divergence debate.||Sashi Sivramkrishna

The analysis shows that land remained in the control of upper castes in coastal Andhra and Rayalaseema, in Telangana landownership came into the hands of Other Backward Classes primarily due to peasant movements. The contradictions of agricultural workers, tenants, and the landless with the rich peasant class led to intense caste confl icts in coastal Andhra, factional violence in Rayalaseema, and struggles against the state and propertied classes in Telangana.||N Purendra Prasad

10-04-2015||special articles||---------||Fetishism of Hinduism and Its Secret Thereof : A Retort to the Indian Fascists||With the emergence of right-wing Hindutva forces backed by corporate monopoly capitalists and the media industry, and legitimised by the general culture of liberal democracy, a fresh understanding of fascism in India is necessary. This new understanding of fascism in India links the politics of Hindutva to Hinduism proper and claims that Hindutva, whilst being influenced by European fascism, also emerges from the general contradictions of Hinduism and uses caste-based, alienated social divisions to demonise Muslims and construct its authoritarian politics. The liberals imagine a secular opposition to Hindutva fascism from within the parliamentary system and the established left posits mere economism accompanied by parliamentary tactics. In opposition to them, this essay argues for an "Indian Fanonism" where the radical subaltern critique of Hinduism of B R Ambedkar, helped by Walter Benjamin's critique of culture in the era of late imperialism, takes the role of the Marxist weapons of critique.||Murzban Jal
10-04-2015||special articles||---------||Silver Lining in Odisha's Organised Manufacturing Sector :||Odisha's industry sector began a phase of high growth in 2002-03. It contributed just 24% to the gross state domestic product in 1980-81, but 38% in 2007-08, before declining to 33% in 2012-13. This paper points out that organised manufacturing, especially in basic metal and alloys, has been the driver of growth in the last decade. The average productivity of labour in organised manufacturing increased during 1981-90, peaked in 1989-90, declined in 1991-2002, and has been rising again from 2002-03. Labour productivity has grown the most in basic metal and alloys, and capital accumulation in paper and paper products. Capital productivity shows a negative trend overall. Total factor productivity fell in manufacturing as a whole and three major sub-sectors, barring basic metal and alloys, and chemical and chemical products.||Amarendra Das,Chakradhar Bal,Subas Chandra Kumar

02-04-2015||perspectives||---------||Reading Fürer-Haimendorf in North-East India :||Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf's works on North-East India grew out of an interest in the so-called remote pre-contact primitive societies. To him and his contemporaries in the West it was self-evident that the "primitive" or the "savage" are located outside modernity. No one today would use those categories. But this does not mean that we have broken away from intellectual habits which privilege the social imaginary of the modern. In certain parts of the world the politics of indigeneity is associated with powerful critiques of capitalist modernity. But that is not the case in North-East India. Whether or not such a critical sensibility becomes part of the political imagination will depend partly on the epistemological standpoint of those who study the region today.||Sanjib Baruah
02-04-2015||special articles||---------||From the Phased Manufacturing Programme to Frugal Engineering : Some Initial Propositions||Although the structural reforms, initiated in 1991, did not lead to any appreciable increase in either the efficiency or the export orientation of Indian manufacturing firms, unexpectedly, there has been a visible improvement in manufacturing design capabilities in certain segments, for instance, in the motor vehicle sector. The paper suggests that the development of "frugal engineering"--an approach of "frugality" in resolving complex design problems--is a real advance. It suggests, further, that this approach developed from the experiences of the procedures laid down in the phased manufacturing programme of the 1950s, and first found expression in the successful forays into some specific export markets by Indian vehicle manufacturers in the late 1970s and 1980s. Although this design expertise cannot solve the problems of manufacturing efficiency, particularly across the wider industrial sphere, it indicates that Indian firms have the expertise to resolve problems related to the manufacturing sphere if strategic goals are appropriately set by managers.||Nasir Tyabji
02-04-2015||special articles||---------||Secularism in a Pluri-Religious Society : The Constitutional Vision||The idea of secularism as expressed in our Constitution and as articulated over the years through the political process is embedded in the concepts of equality and democracy rather than in the Western concept of secularism which denies religion any space in the public sphere. This secularism, admittedly, is a peculiar Indian invention. But it is one necessitated by the historical conditions of Indian society in which a modern democratic state is being introduced into a traditional and religious society by our national leadership and our Constitution makers at the time of independence. It demands an affirmation of religious freedom against religious oppression, of religious tolerance against religious chauvinism. What this calls for is an open-ended but value-committed dialogue between believers of various faiths and followers of different traditions in an "heretical response" to our present challenges, or in other words, in a search for collective alternatives to modernity and secularisation. Neither the "positive secularism" of the Hindu right, nor the Nehruvian version of the liberal left, nor the anti-secularism of the anti-modernist are able to provide an adequate basis for such a quest in the changing socio-religious situation of our times. Rather we need to recapture the inspiration of our freedom struggle as expressed in the vision of our Constitution.||Rudolf C Heredia
02-04-2015||special articles||---------||From Policy to Practice : How Should Social Pensions Be Scaled Up?||A survey in Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh—sstates that have extended social pension coverage beyond "below poverty line" families and increased pension amounts—sprovides a window into the challenges of scaling up such programmes. The survey reveals that increased coverage and higher pension amounts do not render the social pension regressive in its distribution; levels of leakage remain low and tractable. Yet, in practice, the schemes are unable to reach all of their target populations. A major challenge in expanding the pension net lies in ensuring entry for the poor. If pension programmes are to be scaled up, entry needs to be facilitated through stricter monitoring of inclusion errors, proactive identification, enrolment camps or other means.||Maria Mini Jos,Rinku Murgai,Shrayana Bhattacharya,Soumya Kapoor Mehta

After walking out of the party's state conference in Alappuzha in February, Achuthanandan has been consigned to the sidelines. This has been the culmination of a process partly of his own making and partly of the party's making--one involving too many convenient compromises, and a political line that now values pragmatism above all.||V Krishna Ananth

But the recent exposures of journalists taking favours from corporate groups have only highlighted once again an old phenomenon in India--codes of conduct are observed in their breach and Chinese walls are usually non-existent in media organisations. Since the 1980s, groups of journalists have tried to straddle the worlds of the media, business and politics, and in the process have damaged the functioning of democracy in the country.||Jyotirmoy Chaudhuri,Paranjoy Guha Thakurta
25-03-2015||special articles||---------||The Golden Cage : Stability of the Institution of Marriage in India||The form and nature of marriage and family life have changed over the past few decades in Western societies and in East Asia, but they have taken different pathways. Reproduction is becoming delinked from marriage in the West, while in East Asia remaining single has become more of a norm. Looking at how the various factors operating in these societies impinge on marriages in India, this paper finds that while development has contributed to a significant rise in age at marriage, it has not altered the ultimate proportion of the population getting married by 0-34. These figures are in stark contrast to what is observed in the West and Japan. Deeply rooted in religion and caste, and with marital breakdown facing punishing social and economic costs, the institution of marriage is strong in India and unlikely to show signs of a breakdown in the near future.||K S James,K Srinivasan
27-03-2015||special articles||---------||Unfinished Tasks in the Liberalisation of Spectrum for Mobile Services :||After a command and control paradigm of spectrum management lasting from 2001 to 2008, India has gone in for a phased transition to a liberalised regime. Notable elements of this change include the unbundling of spectrum from the service licence, the choice of the auction mechanism for the assignment of spectrum and the freedom to use a spectrum block with any technology. However, elements of the current scenario of spectrum markets in India indicate that there remains an unfinished agenda in spectrum liberalisation. These include a high price of spectrum compared to international benchmarks, low spectrum holding per operator, and vast tracts of unutilised spectrum in rural areas. The lacunae in the current framework of spectrum management leading to persisting inefficiencies are elaborated upon and solutions proposed.||Rohit Prasad,V Sridhar

It provides evidence that MGNREGA works support agriculture, and benefit a large number of small and marginal farmers. An overwhelming 90% of the respondents considered the works very useful or somewhat useful, while only 8% felt they were useless. Further, most works continue to be maintained and are in a good condition. Overall, this study suggests that the widespread perception that the MGNREGA does not create anything productive appears to be misplaced, although there is scope for improving the choice of works, their design, and their execution.||Ashwini Kulkarni,Krushna Ranaware,Sudha Narayanan,Upasak Das

20-03-2015||budget 2015–16||---------||Long on Announcements, Short on Intent :||The first full-year budget of the National Democratic Alliance government announced a sharp focus on investment, growth and social security. In addition, Budget 2015-16 claims to have given a boost to cooperative federalism. The budget indeed makes numerous impressive-sounding announcements, but stumbles in the details. This article focuses on the attention-grabbing push for investments and finds that the target of Rs 70,000 crore investment may be over-ambitious. As far as devolution of funds to states is concerned, the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission have been diluted and the states may find themselves short-changed.||Ajit Karnik,Mala Lalvani

But the larger question is not of arithmetic but of a shift in policy towards greater fiscal autonomy to the states by ensuring more than 70% of the fund flow through the Finance Commission route and also preserving the fiscal space for the union for its own functions. It is about getting expenditure priorities right at each level of government.||Pinaki Chakraborty

Shakespeare as a commons continues to gather cultural capital because of the iterability of the brand in mass/popular forms and media that now possess the maximum cultural legibility (like the graphic novel or Hollywood romance). This is possible even more in the digital age because the Shakespearean page, stage, and image are all available simultaneously on a screen, making Shakespeare an interactive, global archive.||Pramod K Nayar
18-03-2015||special articles||---------||How Should India Reform Its Labour Laws? :||This paper examines the current policy debate around the reform of labour laws in India, which has been stimulated in part by the success of the "Gujarat model of economic development." Gujarat's deregulatory reforms have included changes to the legal regime governing employment terminations, which could form a basis for a change in national-level labour laws. Evidence linking labour law deregulation to growth, however, is weak, whether the focus is on India or the experience of other countries. Building labour market institutions is a long-term process which requires investment in state capacity for the management of risks associated with the transition to a formal economy.||Antara Haldar,Simon Deakin

As a prelude, the paper traces the origin and phases of start-up growth in India, and its employment contribution, relative to the organised sector. The paper concludes with an emphasis on the need for a steady increase in new generation start-ups as a means of productive employment generation, economic transformation and growth.||M H Bala Subrahmanya

Moving away from frequently acknowledged macro concerns, a few recurring, persistent problems remain insufficiently analysed. This article aims to capture the complexity and distress caused by the co-occurrence and interrelatedness of poverty, mental ill health and homelessness. It examines the ramifications of this nexus in domains including health systems and access to healthcare, productive living and full participation, social attitudes and responsiveness, and the development of human resources and leadership in the social sector. It also discusses the failure to engage with these issues which results in greater vulnerability, distress and social defeat among the affected populations.||Joske Bunders,Kamala Easwaran,Lakshmi Narasimhan,S Parasuraman,Vandana Gopikumar

Reviewing the experience of local area banks and the landscape of financial inclusion, this paper identifies internal contradictions in the approach to narrow banks -- primary objectives, structures, limitation of size and geography, mainstream banking standards, evaluation of performance. Despite these issues, the existing banks are indeed performing (under severe constraints), and do not give cause for anxiety on solvency and stability.||aparna krishna,M S Sriram

In view of this, the paper attempts to analyse the role of possible regulation in the off-grid electrification sector and explores the type of regulatory incentive structures that could be put in place in order to allow the off-grid sector to do well.||Debajit Palit,Kaushik Ranjan Bandyopadhyay
04-03-2015||special articles||---------||Bio-medicalisation and Gandhi's Vision of Health : Observations from Sevagram||Modern medicine has created a dichotomy: modern medicine on the one hand, and alternative systems on the other. This paper views this dichotomy and liminality in the context of Gandhi's vision of health. It delineates the elements and structural coordinates of this alternative healthcare system, and tries to understand how, over time, a synthesis has occurred between the epistemologies of Nature Cure and Modern Medicine. It also looks at how Gandhi's vision of health has undergone a change at two levels, that of "space" and structural relations. This paper also tries to understand how the archaeology of discourse and medical perception evolves, changes and coexists under the canvas of larger political-economic situations.||P C Joshi,Prashant Khattri
05-03-2015||notes||---------||Industrial Growth in Two Border Cities of the Punjab :||Did the Sikh militancy, beginning in the late 1970s and ending in the late 1990s, have a negative effect on the industrial sector of the Indian Punjab, especially in its northern districts? This note discusses and compares the industrial growth of Batala (in Gurdaspur District of the Indian Punjab) and Sialkot (a border city in the Pakistani Punjab), as both these cities had similar colonial origins of their industries, and these industries were shattered by partition. In the post-independence period, like in Sialkot, industry in Batala might have achieved an impressive growth if the Sikh militancy had not interceded. Batala and Sialkot had a similar industrial past, but they have a dissimilar industrial present. The comparison suggests that the argument for a special industrial package for Punjab is not without substance.||Gagan Preet Singh
05-03-2015||discussion||---------||Irrigation and Energy Nexus : Solar Pumps Are Not Viable||Groundwater ha s emerged as the mainstay of irrigated agriculture in India. However, ineffective institutional arrangements for its management have resulted in both groundwater over-exploitation and wasteful use of energy. To address the dependence of groundwater use on energy, suggestions have been made to adopt solar-powered irrigation pumps. It is argued that solar pumps are not only economically unviable, but under the present policy context, their use would do little to reduce groundwater and energy use in Indian agriculture.||Nitin Bassi

Accused falsely of being an illegal Bangladesh immigrant, Khan was one of thousands of Bengali-speaking Muslims who have lived in Dimapur for decades.

But given our vulnerability as a downstream nation it is clear that we need to reconsider our own thinking about rivers, and be consistent between what we do internally and what we expect our neighbours to do, and between our behaviour towards our downstream neighbours and the behaviour that we expect from China vis-à-vis ourselves.||Ramaswamy R Iyer

At the same time, they underline the importance of exceeding it to enable the recovery of other political, economic and social problematics. Such an approach is a necessary first step in reimagining dominant approaches to development in the context of war and transitions and setting really transformative agendas.||Vijay K Nagaraj
25-02-2015||conflict, transition and development||---------||Protests and Counter Protests : Competing Civil Society Spaces in Post-war Sri Lanka||The value of civil society lies in that it provides a space for alternative views, debate, and dissent. Yet, this paper points out, civil society in post-war Sri Lanka is captive to the forces of local and global politics. While this has resulted in the emergence of new forms of resistance and dissent, it has also given rise to less palatable, illiberal, and dangerous movements such as the resurgence of radical Sinhala Buddhist activism. The tacit state approval granted to these movements has meant that state response to different civil society groups has been markedly lopsided. Thus, post-war Sri Lankan society has been subject to greater state control and an extreme polarisation of values and ideas.||
25-02-2015||conflict, transition and development||---------||Contradictions of the Sri Lankan State :||The policies of the Sri Lankan state since the late 1970s have seen a widening gap between its neo-liberal foundations and its attempts to claim popular legitimacy, and this structure of politics seems set to persist. This paper argues that the tension between neo-liberalism and populism is articulated in the disparity between the island's urban and rural areas, and vice versa. This defines contradictory aspects of the Sri Lankan state as we understand its appeal to different constituencies, both the new urban middle classes and increasingly impoverished small farmers. Instead of looking at how neo-liberalism deploys populism to garner mass support, the study examines the messy consequences of the ways in which populism attempts to manage the effects of neo-liberalism, manifest primarily in the increasing immiseration of the masses.||Devaka Gunawardena
25-02-2015||conflict, transition and development||---------||The Reintegration of Maoist Ex-Combatants in Nepal :||In Nepal, a decade-long insurgency, led by the Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) continued till 2006, claimed more than 13,000 lives, and displaced thousands of people. Arguing that Nepal has moved forward in reintegrating its former combatants, this paper points out that this is a task that many other countries have failed to carry out successfully. It demonstrates that the country's approach to reintegration was unique and unorthodox, but, in some ways, effective. Nevertheless, there were problems and some of them persist, especially to do with social reintegration, in particular, gender and caste relations. The process of reintegration is far from complete, given that the former combatants left their cantonments only in 2012.||Chiranjibi Bhandari
25-02-2015||conflict, transition and development||---------||Myanmar: Conflicts over Land in a Time of Transition :||Secure and just land tenure, and sound management of land and natural resources are crucial to easing conflicts between farmers, the State, and extractive industries. This paper underlines that Myanmar cannot hope to achieve inclusive social and economic development without a just and comprehensive framework that protects the land rights of small farmers, ethnic minorities, and the poor. A lack of participation and transparency in land management, coupled with legal and institutional weaknesses that work in favour of big capital rather than small farmers and the rural poor, poses a major challenge to the country's social and economic reform programme.||Soe Nandar Linn
25-02-2015||conflict, transition and development||---------||Making Pickles during a Ceasefire : Livelihood, Sustainability, and Development in Nagaland||Development projects in the North East are packaged as economic interventions to improve the lives of people, but are detached from militarised ground realities. These initiatives to rebuild post-conflict societies mainly focus on training entrepreneurs and promoting livelihood schemes while overlooking how violence has transformed the very foundation of these societies. Generalising from the example of a workshop on food preservation in Nagaland that had no participants, this paper points out that governance should be rooted in the political and social history of a place - it should not be categorised as a time-bound crisis management project.||Dolly Kikon
26-02-2015||conflict, transition and development||---------||Peeling the Onion : Social Regulation of the Onion Market, Nangarhar, Afghanistan||Afghanistan's hope that market-driven agriculture will ensure its economic transformation demonstrates a wilful disregard of the links between the economic and political marketplaces in the country, and the pervasive rent-seeking practices of informal and formal power holders. This paper, based on a study of the onion markets in Nangarhar, a south-eastern province, reports on how an agricultural commodity market works in practice, and the ways in which social relationships regulate access to it. It is not access to credit and market information that constrains growth, as aid agencies seem to believe, but the practices of a trade elite that largely operates on informal credit and relationships of trust based on close personal networks.||Adam Pain,GIulia Minoia,Wamiqullah Mumtaz
26-02-2015||special articles||---------||Crime against Women and Children in Delhi : Analysis of Secondary and Empirical Data||This paper analyses crime against women and children in Delhi based on two data sources, the National Crime Records Bureau and an empirical data set of the Perceptions Survey of the Delhi Human Development Report, 2013. Using the NCRB data, the paper analyses trends in the rate and composition of crime against women and children from 2004-2006 to 2010-2012, including charge sheets and convictions. Results from the Perceptions Survey highlight the spatial nature of crime in the state, the differential experience of crime by social groups, as well as men and women. A key finding is the high vulnerability of children to crime in the city. What emerges from the comparison of secondary and primary data is the simultaneous existence of incidence of crime on the one hand and perception of crime and violence on the other. A combination of various data sources is important to capture both incidence and perception in order to gain a more holistic and in-depth understanding of crime and violence, a vastly under-researched topic in the social sciences.||Amrita Datta,Shivani Satija
27-02-2015||special articles||---------||Policy Options for including Petroleum, Natural Gas and Electricity in the Goods and Services Tax :||This study analyses the impact of keeping crude petroleum, natural gas, motor spirit (gasoline/petrol), high-speed diesel (diesel), aviation turbine fuel and electricity out of the value-added tax scheme. Specifically, the paper finds that keeping these items out of the input tax credit mechanism (either partially or fully) would result in cascading. Through an input-output framework, this study proposes some alternatives to the proposed design of the Goods and Services Tax and assesses the implications for cascading and prices. It captures the degree of cascading across 48 sectors under different scenarios and explores alternative policy options to phase out under-recoveries of oil marketing companies on account of sales of diesel and petrol under the administered pricing mechanism.||R Kavita Rao,Sacchidananda Mukherjee

20-02-2015||commentary||---------||Minoritarian Rule : How India’s Electoral System Created the Illusion of a BJP Landslide||India's 2014 election results showed a high degree of disproportionality in the conversion of votes to seats. The Bharatiya Janata Party won only 31% of the vote and its vote was highly geographically concentrated. The BJP's "landslide" victory was in fact due to the idiosyncrasies of India's first-past-the-post electoral system. While not unique in the country's history, the scale of the BJP's seat bonus in 2014 returns India to "minoritarian" - as opposed to majoritarian -- democracy, in which democratic outcomes are perverted by disproportionately empowering the ruling party.||Babak Moussavi,Geoffrey Macdonald

While getting children to school is a central pillar of the state's mandate of promoting social justice and enabling improved opportunities and life-chances for all, the empirical data presented in this article shows how children, identified by their social milieu and even humiliated on that count, can be constrained within the processes and the ethos of learning.||Jyoti Dalal

The multilingual and multicultural ethos that is constitutive of Indian society was ignored. The focus was so much on containing the existing political safeguards available to the religious and backward minorities that the rights of linguistic minorities were compromised.

The Environmental Impact Assessment notification of 2006, subsequent amendments and associated guidelines provide the framework to document untoward effects of proposed industrial and developmental projects on the environment, and to manage them. It is also implicitly understood that the notification covers human health concerns arising from the proposed projects. Are health concerns being adequately accounted for when projects are provided clearance? Through the use of a standardised framework, several gaps were found in health-related aspects of the notification and the two evaluated EIA reports analysed here. Further reflection is called for on the purpose of EIAs to prevent human health from becoming a casualty on the path to "development".||Adithya Pradyumna

Reducing pollution in these areas to achieve the standard would, we estimate, increase life expectancy for these Indians by 3.2 years on average for a total of 2.1 billion life years.

The article provides a detailed discussion of the problems and concerns of cross-border migrants, and India's policy stance in dealing with immigration. It argues that India needs to differentiate between the stocks and the flows of its immigrant population. Also, it would no doubt be in the larger interests of the country to control the unabated flows of migrants from across the borders and minimise their negative effects, but one must not lose sight of the components of a humane migration policy, including investment in the human capital of the migrant population.||Binod Khadria,Perveen Kumar

The main source of leakages is the "above the poverty line" quota, which is due to be phased out under the National Food Security Act.||Jean Dreze,Reetika Khera
11-02-2015||special articles||---------||Right to Education and Inclusion in Private Unaided Schools : An Exploratory Study in Bengaluru and Delhi||Section 12(1)(c) of the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009 provides for inclusion of children from disadvantaged and weaker sections in private unaided schools. Although meant to foster inclusion and achieve social justice objectives, this legal provision has been highly contested and its implications for the expanding private sector in school education are not fully understood. This article is based on an exploratory study, conducted in Bengaluru and Delhi, which examines the status of implementation of this provision with a view to delineate key issues at the level of state administration, schools and parents. Using qualitative data collected from the two sites, the study compares and comments on the extent to which the provision has been able to deliver on its purported goal of inclusion. It concludes by identifying gaps and challenges that require an urgent policy response.||Annie Namala,Archana Mehendale,Rahul Mukhopadhyay
11-02-2015||special articles||---------||Implications of Land Acquisition for Dalits : Explorations in Maharashtra||This paper tries to capture the externalities that arise from land acquisition and the consequent development that occurs on the acquired land. A case study of Maan village close to Pune in Maharashtra attempts to see if the externalities arising out of the development of land show a caste bias. While the economic condition of the Dalits remains inferior to the non-Dalits, there is no difference in the benefits that have accrued to the Dalits and the non-Dalits due to the externalities. There has been a positive movement in favour of the Dalits as far as issues related to dignity, discrimination and dependence are concerned. They are mainly dependent upon non-governmental jobs, which give them an escape out of the earlier feudal relations but the kind of jobs that they engage in possibly keeps them frozen in traditional caste identities.||Dhanmanjiri Sathe
13-02-2015||special articles||---------||Subaltern Historiography to Dalit Historiography : Tracing Heterogeneity in Dalit ‘Subalternity’||Existing academic scholarship on Dalit writings and politics seems to be heavily marked by a common perception that such politics almost always focuses on claiming the state corridors of power. This article contests that view and seeks to trace the genealogy of such common academic perceptions by invoking the Subaltern Studies discourse on caste and subalternity. It argues that the relationship of Dalits vis-à-vis the state and statist ideology is heavily ambivalent, and any attempt to construct a Dalit historiography cannot proceed without recognising that ambivalence, even while it must accept and use some of the methodological insights developed by the Subaltern Studies scholars.||Kalyan Das

Drawing on an intensive survey with MGNREGA wage-seekers, it examines the role of social audits in providing a platform for citizens to engage with the state; the state's ability to respond to grievances raised through the audit; and the effects of the audit on the local corruption market.||Soumya Kapoor Mehta,Yamini Aiyar

05-02-2015||special articles||---------||Caste and the Power Elite in Allahabad||This article examines the social composition of public institutions in Allahabad, and specifically, the share of different castes and communities in positions of power and influence - the Press Club, the university faculty, the Bar Association, the police, and the commanding positions in trade unions, non-governmental organisations, media houses, among other public institutions. These turn out to be heavily dominated by a small group of upper castes - Brahmins and Kayasthas in particular. Disadvantaged castes, for their part, are largely relegated to subordinate or menial positions. The findings raise troubling questions about the resilience of caste hierarchies. Aside from better enforcement of reservation norms, there is an urgent need for more voluntary attention to diversity in public life, of the sort that has significantly reduced ethnic or gender imbalances in other countries.||Aashish Gupta,Ankita Aggarwal,Jean Dreze
05-02-2015||special articles||---------||NREGS in Rajasthan : Rationed Funds and Their Allocation across Villages||The performance of National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in Rajasthan was debated for its stupendous performance in the initial years of the scheme, but also for the relative sharp decline after 2010. Based on a large representative primary survey, this paper argues that the decline in performance of this scheme in Rajasthan is not entirely due to the lack of demand. Instead, the supply-driven top-down nature of the programme has led to a "discouraged worker" syndrome with workers showing disinterest in demanding work and passively waiting for availability of NREGS work. Strengthening the demand-based nature of the NREGS may reduce the need for rationing. Simple temporal tracking of NREGS outcomes at the village level along with proper recording of demand through the Management Information System may well help detect discrimination within panchayats.||Abhiroop Mukhopadhyay,Himanshu,M R Sharan

It calls for a mixing of income groups in the same locality and delivers spatial equity simply by the manner of its layout, with no additional effort required in that direction. Each household pays for its housing in proportion to its income. There is no need for external subsidies, provided land and infrastructure can be made available within cost limits determined by the income profile of the city or town in which it is taken up.||Shirish B Patel

29-01-2015||public sector||---------||Can the Public Sector Revive the Economy? : Review of the Evidence and a Policy Suggestion||The public sector's share in domestic output has stagnated since the late 1980s, its share in capital stock has fallen since 1990, and employment has contracted by 10% from the mid-1990s. Why has it fared so poorly even as its financial performance has improved? This paper argues that fiscal orthodoxy has throttled government borrowing for investment, and competitive politics has disallowed rational pricing by public utilities and recovery of user charges. If these constraints are relaxed by suitably adjusting fiscal deficit targets to accommodate the rise in input costs, and the prices of public utility services are adjusted for inflation, the public sector can revive the economy. Growing public sector enterprises with financial surpluses could also accommodate some political-economic demands.||R Nagaraj
29-01-2015||public sector||---------||The Transformation of India's Public Sector : Political Economy of Growth and Change||This paper examines the paradox of the diminishing institutional role of large central public sector enterprises despite rising profitability and investment as a result of their being efficient competitors in the new market environment. Under the neo-liberal regime of the last two decades, these CPSES, with large cash balances and improved profitability, have emerged as the main drivers of public savings and investment. But instead of enhancing their strategic role, the union government has been treating them as cash cows. A comparison of the performance of large private and public sector firms in the manufacturing sector shows that the CPSES have provided higher returns on capital employed. And, performance in terms of technical parameters is in no way inferior to that of their private counterparts. Yet the Modi government intends to either privatise these CPSES or sell a significant part of their equity shares, a decision that is devoid of both strategic and business sense.||Sushil Khanna
29-01-2015||special articles||---------||Rise and Fall of Industrial Finance in India :||Examining the sources of finance for Indian industry, this paper traces the transition from a state-owned and state-dictated financial sector to a regime of financial liberalisation. There are still a number of rough edges to this transition. With the initiation of financial sector reforms and the demise of development banking, there are indications that the industrial sector faces a credit crunch. While newer sources of finance could have compensated for the paucity of bank financing, the exit of development banks before establishing a successful corporate debt market has turned out to be costly for long-term financing. In this context, the experience of the Brazilian Development Bank could serve as a useful model for India.||Partha Ray
30-01-2015||special articles||---------||Layers in Globalising Society and the New Middle Class in India : Trends, Distribution and Prospects||The means of personal transportation to which one has access constitute an important part of one's relationship with globalisation, limiting or enhancing the scope of activity and area of influence. We define economic classes in relation to different transportation assets, considering as the lower middle class those who have motorcycles or motor-scooters, and as the upper middle class, those who own automobiles. Unambiguously identifying a middle class is difficult; the term is relational, context-dependent, and inchoate. However, the lower- and upper-middle classes, defined in this manner, are robust to alternative definitions: these groups have substantially higher incomes than groups below, own disproportionately large shares of other physical assets, and do much better in terms of education, health, media exposure, and social capital. The middle class increased from 11% in 1992 to almost double this percentage in the early years of the new millennium. Subsequently, its growth has slowed down, coming almost to a halt in rural areas. Fragility and volatility are in evidence; many, formerly in the middle class, have fallen back. It cannot be blithely assumed that India's middle class will grow much larger.||Anirudh Krishna,Devendra Bajpai

30-01-2015||economic notes||---------||Recent Trends in Inter-Sectoral Terms of Trade :||Revisiting an old debate about terms of trade of agriculture vis-à-vis other sectors in the Indian economy, it is argued that the ToT of agriculture has remained favourable for a large part of the post-liberalisation phase, with it being most favourable since the mid-2000s. This is despite rising costs of production, high rural inflation, and rising human labour costs. It is further argued that large farmers seem to have benefited the most from the favourable ToT, which helps understand the narrowing inequality between rural and urban India, along with rising inequality within rural India.||J Dennis Rajakumar,R Krishnaswamy

21-01-2015||perspectives||---------||A Tale of Two Commissions and the Missing Links :||There have been several missing links in the recent debate on the future of the Planning and Finance Commissions. First, it is not clear whether the debate was more about the future of planning or about the future of the Planning Commission. How do the proposals for institutional reform fix the problems relating to the process of planning and implementation? Second, there are emerging new realities of economic management that the new institution has to grasp and address, requiring new skills and, perhaps, a new set of instruments. Third, both the commissions operate in a multilevel context, namely, union, states and local bodies. Institutional reform has to be contextualised to multilevel processes.||Y Venugopal Reddy

The country was in the midst of a general political crisis; even sections of the peasantry were in revolt. Despite these favourable circumstances, and the expression of solidarity from the industrial working class, the National Coordination Committee for Railwaymen's Struggle was not resolute and decisive enough, as much as the situation demanded, and in this respect it failed the rank and file. In the absence of a political vanguard, the uprising was left without a determined subject.||Ranabir Samaddar

Though this was extensively deliberated upon in contemporary studies and in the works of the late 19th and early 20th century economists and historians, it finds almost no mention in the more recent debate. Revisiting this episode from history, this paper aims to draw attention anew to the important role India played in the evolution of the world monetary system.||Sashi Sivramkrishna

It also touches upon factors influencing livelihoods such as source of irrigation, crop yield, forest produce collection, and livestock holdings to examine the respondents' socio-economic conditions. The findings revealed that the land received by the beneficiaries was very meagre in proportion to what they claimed. Besides, the study once again reiterates that forest cover was not disturbed as feared by those opposing this Act simply because no new land in the forest was given to the claimants. The land in fact was just recognised legally with the help of documents as proof that they have been occupants for long or at least from 2005 onwards. However, for those who got legal recognition over their land, it has boosted their confidence. They now feel the real ownership of their plots which led to investing in their lands without any fear about secure livelihoods.||Madhusudan Bandi

While this had adverse impacts on both the substance and structure of regulation in the sector, this paper examines specifically the nature of institutional design of TRAI in Chapter II of the TRAI Act, 1997, and the inefficiencies inherent in the structural imbalance between regulator and licensor.||Maruthi P Tangirala

16-01-2015||commentary||---------||Inflation Targeting as Policy Option for India :||Inflation targeting may have its benefits but the timing of India’s ongoing transition to IT – an adverse domestic and global macroeconomic context – poses signifi cant risks to a successful implementation. Moreover, the evidence of IT having a positive impact comes from the pre-financial crisis era; more recent studies of the emerging market economies over a longer period show the non-IT countries growing faster than those which have adopted IT.||Renu Kohli
16-01-2015||commentary||---------||In the Era of the Neo-Fascist, Neo-liberal Coalition : Narendra Modi’s Intellectual Brigade||In a peculiar re-enactment of the fascist past, sections of the Indian intellectual community are displaying a horrifying moral ambiguity in their slow drift into a system that typifi es a dangerous and opportunist liaison between the forces of unrestrained market economy (thriving under the global order of neo-liberalism) and unabated religious nationalist authoritarianism (consolidating itself under the neo-fascist canopy of the Sangh Parivar).||Sumanta Banerjee
16-01-2015||commentary||---------||Ghar Wapsi: Political Agenda, Religious Garb :||An appropriate response is not to curtail legitimate civil liberties or democratic freedoms, for this could have even more dangerous political and social consequences in areas of civil liberties and democratic rights, but rather to work towards better inter-religious understanding and dialogue. Those opposed to religious conversions also need to interrogate themselves. Why is it that the oppression or wretchedness of would-be converts merits little attention, except in the event of their changing religious allegiance?||Rudolf C Heredia

It holds that this decline can be associated with the interventions initiated through the Rajmata Jijau Mother-Child Health and Nutrition Mission, which began in 2005, and that this indicates the critical role the state can play in reducing child under-nutrition in India.||K S Hari,Sunny Jose

15-01-2015||special articles||---------||Industrial Conflict in India in the Post-Reform Period : Who Said All Is Quiet on the Industrial Front?||The processes of liberalisation, globalisation, and privatisation were expected to weaken the bargaining power of workers vis-à-vis employers and lead to a reduction in the number and frequency of industrial conflicts. However, the reform measures were in some cases successfully opposed by trade unions, and in some cases they also led to aggressive labour market practices by employers. This has resulted in tensions, work stoppages, and even violence. Even unorganised workers have participated in these agitations in a big way. This paper examines the features of industrial conflict using both official data and qualitative information as official statistics do not adequately capture the variety and dynamics of industrial conflicts.||K R Shyam Sundar
16-01-2015||special articles||---------||Karpoori Thakur: A Socialist Leader in the Hindi Belt :||Born in a poor Nai (barber) family, Karpoori Thakur, a committed socialist, played an important role in politics of Bihar for more than four decades between the 1950s and 1980s. He introduced controversial policies of reservation (the "Karpoori Thakur Formula") and on language and employment, when he was chief minister of Bihar twice and deputy chief minister once during the 1970s. His political career passed through three phases: in the first he enjoyed support from most caste groups, in the second he got identified as a leader of the Other Backward Classes, in the third he was in search of a support base, especially among the most backward classes, dalits and the poor, as a section of the dominant OBCs had turned away from him. The politics of Bihar since the 1990s cannot be delinked from the legacy of Karpoori Thakur.||Jagpal Singh
16-01-2015||special articles||---------||Assessing Bihar's Coupon-Based PDS : Importance of Local Context||The public distribution system remains the bedrock of India's food security system and the Food Security Act (2013) has only increased its importance. At the same time, the PDS administration has been subject to reform, change and experimentation. States have been experimenting ways to reduce leakages and maladministration. Since 2007, Bihar has used coupons to administer the PDS in order to curb leakages at the fair price shops. How effective has this reform been? Drawing on a primary survey of 350 households from 10 villages in a western district of Bihar, this article suggests that while the coupon system is a potentially effective operational reform, setting the PDS right requires reforms that take into consideration the local politics of resources and rights.||Bill Pritchard,Chetan Choithani

This article uncovers the tangled yet well-known roots of violence in Pakistan today to illustrate how the military-dominated State's designated ideology and political machinations have brought the country to this pass. The strengthening of democracy is the only way to prevent such incidents from recurring, but the Peshawar attacks have been used precisely to weaken democratic institutions vis-á-vis the military establishment.||Aasim Sajjad Akhtar

Providing access to sanitation facilities in rural areas of India has been on the agenda of the Government of India for the past three decades. However, a reinvigorated thrust to provide adequate sanitation facilities in rural India is the need of the hour, which must be accompanied by constant scrutiny and monitoring, so as to arrive at apt decisions and policies for further action.||Arjun Kumar

08-01-2015||special articles||---------||Has Globalisation Flattened the Phillips Curve? :||This paper seeks, theoretically as well as empirically, to argue that one of the most important effects of globalisation has been on the working class of the advanced capitalist countries. While the workers in the South have always had a vulnerable position due to their weak bargaining position, the process of globalisation has weakened the working class of the North as their incomes get tethered to their comrades in the South. The reserve armies of labour cannot anymore be considered just "national", they should instead be seen as part of a "global" reserve army of labour.||Anupam Das,Rohit Azad
08-01-2015||special articles||---------||Returning to the Histories of the Late 19th and Early 20th Century Immigration :||The late 19th and early 20th centuries were a period of globalisation when migration controls were put in place. As at present, then too, control of migrant labour was not the concern of governments alone. Employers, recruitment agents, labour brokers in sending and receiving countries, lawyers, courts, training institutes, moneylenders and other credit agencies, smugglers and a wide variety of intermediaries sought to gain from the transnational flow of workers. If the earlier period of globalisation marked by industrial capitalism called for massive supply of labour forming its underbelly, the present globalisation marked by unprecedented financialisation of capital and other resources calls for similar supply of labour forming the underbelly of the beast today.||Ranabir Samaddar
08-01-2015||special articles||---------||Growth, Structural Change and Wage Rates in Rural India :||Examining the structural transformation in India and its developed states to know whether they have passed the Lewis turning point, this paper finds that there was slow structural change in labour markets at the national level. But states such as Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana are on the verge of the Lewis turning point with faster non-farm sector growth, high per capita income, urbanisation, higher agricultural labour productivity, and higher wage rates. On the other hand, states with rapid economic growth such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra have lower wage rates and higher rural poverty. But they too have the potential to pass the Lewis turning point if structural change occurs soon.||A Amarender REddy
08-01-2015||notes||---------||Lake Fisheries in Kashmir : A Case More Undone Than Done||The Dal and Wular lakes produce 70% of the total fish production in Jammu and Kashmir. In addition to introduction of carps, negative externalities of tourism, excessive fertilisation of vegetable crops on floating gardens leading to algal blooms have all led to a consistent decline and destruction of the breeding grounds of the local fish species schizothorax. Though fish production in absolute terms may be increasing in the Dal lake, the rate of growth of even carp fish production is declining. The restoration of schizothorax fishery in the lakes of Kashmir on an even keel will ensure growth in socio-economic-cultural terms and the sustainability of fishery.||M Krishnan,Neha W Qureshi

The clarifi cations discussed here are (1) what is new in the approach defining the poverty line; (2) the use of calories; (3) multidimensional poverty; (4) high urban poverty in many states; (5) NAS-NSS consumption differences; (6) poverty measures in other countries; (7) public expenditure and poverty; and (8) poverty ratio eligibility for access to programmes. As most of the researchers have commented on multidimensional poverty, this note also elaborates on the reasons for not considering this measure in the report.||C Rangarajan,S Mahendra Dev

There seems to be an overt and covert effort to ensure that big corporate houses take over the development projects at the cost of local communities and natural resources.

What has been completely overlooked in the process is that regional backwardness in India is a moving frontier with the most intense forms of poverty and deprivation getting increasingly concentrated within enclaves of backwardness, especially those inhabited by adivasi communities. This paper reports on a recent exercise within the Planning Commission that tries to capture this dynamic of regional backwardness in India.||Arunish Chawla,Mihir Shah,Sanchita Bakshi
02-01-2015||special articles||---------||The Audacity of Method :||The dominant theories, methods or epistemologies in sociological or social anthropological work, or even in the wider human sciences, seem inadequate. In response to that challenge, and written from the “South” with due recognition of the cognitive injustices of knowledge production, this article proposes that hemispheric or other binaries need to be laid to rest. Instead, it attempts to see how encounters among a diversity of locations, expressive lives and experiences connect in messy, non-hierarchical, uncharted but resonant and associative ways, such that they insist on destabilising dominant concept or modes of theorising. The article attempts a politics which liberates straitjacketed epistemologies (like binaries) that stifle attempts at knowing or in articulating knowledges. Illustrations, broadly following a “politics of life”, are discussed to propose an alternate, inclusive and cognitively ethical mode of theorising.||Yasmeen Arif

This decision was driven as much by the World Bank-promoted water sector reforms as by domestic politics. Irrigation backlogs and regional imbalances have been the main feature of water politics whose roots go back to the formation of the state. The state government's desire to prioritise water allocation for industrial use in its State Water Policy 2003 met with strong resistance from people in Vidarbha. Although irrigation was eventually prioritised above industry, politics also led to the undermining of the independent water regulatory authority legislated as an essential element of the water sector reforms.||Paromita Goswami

30-12-2015||perspectives||---------||A Brief History of Panchsheel||Contrary to popular belief, Panchsheel did not draw its inspiration from Indian philosophy, nor did it reflect lack of political realism on the part of Jawaharlal Nehru. Panchsheel was promoted by China and India as an instrument for advancing their respective national interests in the mid-1950s. China, the originator of the five principles, sought to reassure neighbours who had developed misgivings about it during the Korean War, and to wean them away from the United States. India viewed Panchsheel as providing some degree of reassurance in the context of the border dispute with China, as well as a means of countering US moves to create new military alliances in Asia. In a final twist of irony, the five principles found a place in the Shanghai Communique (1972), normalising Sino-US relations.||Chandrasekhar Dasgupta
30-12-2015||special articles||---------||Sacralising Dalit Peripheries : Ravidass Deras and Dalit Assertion in Punjab||Dalit peripheries in the vicinity of mainstream villages in Punjab are now no longer stigmatised neighbourhoods. On the contrary, they are fast becoming critical sites of Dalit social protest and assertion. This is often attributed to the sacred and radical ethos of the indigenous Dalit religion in the state--the Ravidassia dharm. Until quite recently, these peripheries were characterised as dens of poverty, filth and disease with no political reverberation except during short electoral intervals or the annual celebration of the anniversaries of guru Ravidass and B R Ambedkar. Often ignored, they remained silent service sectors with a variety of cheap manual labour and dumping grounds for the disposal of the waste of mainstream villages. But over the last few years, the agency of the Ravidass deras has empowered them to assert a separate Dalit identity and demand a share in the local structures of power.||Ronki Ram
30-12-2015||special articles||---------||CPI to WPI Causation : Empirical Analysis of Price Indices in India||The causal relationship between consumer price index and wholesale price index has been the focus of several econometric studies. The CPI could drive the WPI when producers follow mark-up pricing and when wages increase. These could be due to supply shocks that lead producers to hike prices, thereby also increasing consumer prices, which in turn could lead trade unions to demand higher wages--leading to higher WPI. Alternately if consumer expenditure rises in response to a positive income shock--increasing the demand for goods--it can lead to a rise in the derived demand for labour and subsequently wages. The present study attempts to (i) empirically test for the causal influence of CPI on WPI in the frequency domain, and (ii) test whether the observed CPI to WPI causation is demand-driven or driven by supply shocks.||Neeraj Hatekar,Anuradha Patnaik

The 2010 pilot wave of the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India used a comprehensive biomarker module to measure more accurately the burden of health risks and morbidity among older Indians in four pilot states. This paper presents results from the biomarker data collected during the LASI pilot wave and compares them with self-reports. When compared with self-reports, biomarker data revealed a greater burden of health risks and a higher prevalence of chronic disease. By showing the systematic variations in health status between LASI's self-reported data and biomarker data, the paper highlights the value of using biomarkers to establish more reliable estimates of health in national surveys. The biomarkers studied include blood pressure measurements, grip strength, body mass index, and waist-to-hip ratio, all of which provide valuable insights into health trends affecting older adults.||P Arokiasamy,D E Bloom,J Lee,J O'Brien,S Parasuraman,Uttamacharya

Tensions between the Malay majority and other religious groups have been rising especially in the last few years. This descriptive analysis provides explanations regarding the rise of ethnocentrism in Malaysia and the ability of the ruling regime to remain relevant in contemporary times. It also provides a timely analysis of the Najib administration and its chosen trajectories to gain legitimacy.||Kevin Fernandez,Sivamurugan Pandian

There are good reasons to expect that as a source of energy, it will only become less important—in particular the high costs of constructing and operating nuclear reactors and rapidly decreasing costs of renewable energy.||

A community that has being marginalised historically needs to contextualise their identity in forms that can subvert privileged notions of belonging and solidarity.||
