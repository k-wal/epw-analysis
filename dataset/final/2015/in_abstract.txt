11-12-2015||commentary||---------||Environmental Regulation in India : Moving ‘Forward’ in the Old Direction||In a bid to fast-track environmental clearances for industrial projects, the Narendra Modi government constituted a high-level committee in 2014 under T S R Subramanian to review key environmental laws. In the context of the controversial recommendations made by the T S R Subramanian Committee to ease environmental norms and dilute people's participation in environmental governance to stimulate economic development, the article takes a critical look at the functioning of the Environmental Impact Assessment regime in India since its inception in 1994.||Kanchi Kohli,Manju Menon
09-12-2015||commentary||---------||Bhutan's Gross National Happiness : An Interrogation||Despite Bhutan's deliberate policy direction of promoting non-economic goals embodied in gross national happiness over gross domestic product, does GNH still incorporate the promotion of material well-being through adequate living standards based on economic progress? This article examines whether GDP is an incompatible policy objective or outcome when balanced with GNH's equitable and sustainable economic progress, good governance, ecological protection and cultural preservation policy objectives.||Michael Givel
03-12-2015||special articles||---------||Towards Methodologies for Multiple Objective-Based Energy and Climate Policy||Planning for India's energy future requires addressing multiple and simultaneous economic, social and environmental challenges. While there has been conceptual progress towards harnessing their synergies, there are limited methodologies available for operationalising a multiple objective framework for development and climate policy. This paper proposes a "multi-criteria decision analysis" approach to this problem, using illustrative examples from the cooking and buildings sectors. An MCDA approach enables policy processes that are analytically rigorous, participative and transparent, which are required to address India's complex energy and climate challenges.||Radhika Khosla,Srihari Dukkipati,Navroz K Dubash,Ashok Sreenivas,Brett Cohen
25-11-2015||special articles||---------||Politics of the Uniform Civil Code in India :||The debate on the Uniform Civil Code in India has passed through three phases which have been grounded in different normative concerns, that is, national consolidation, equality of laws, and now gender justice. Since the normative goals of a polity and political contingency are in a perpetual struggle in India, the time is appropriate for us to visit the UCC debate with a view to strengthening our constitutional democracy. This article after presenting an overview of the debate suggests that there are mainly two paths to follow to meet this aspiration: (i) changing the ecology of laws relating to women, and (ii) adopting the common civil code that is prevalent in Goa.||Peter Ronald deSouza
19-11-2015||tea plantation labour||---------||Munnar: Through the Lens of Political Ecology :||The workers of the tea plantations of Munnar cannot bank on a future based on rising wages. A critical discussion of the history of settlement, plantations and accumulation in the region suggests that they need to acquire a share in the income from ecologically-sensitive tourism and from a tea that has a brand and therefore higher value, as also from better education in institutions established under corporate social responsibility activities.||Elizabeth Joseph,K T Rammohan,Swathi Soman
21-10-2015||perspectives||---------||Green Politics and the Indian Middle Class :||Four pillars of green politics--social justice, grass-roots democracy, non-violence, and respect for diversity--have become more or less established principles of Indian political parties. The integration of the environmental dimension of green politics, consisting of the twin pillars of ecological wisdom and sustainability, is in an evolutionary phase. It is likely that increasingly this integration will reflect the views of the growing Indian middle class.||Ashok K Lahiri
21-10-2015||special articles||---------||Post-Tsunami Humanitarian Aid : A Trojan Horse in the Southern Nicobar Islands||Historically, the Nicobarese of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have lived in isolation with sporadic cross-cultural contact. Relying on the traditional knowledge and the resources provided by their ecosystem, the indigenes subsisted independently in their tribal reserve until the Indian Ocean tsunami inundated the Nicobar archipelago. Post-tsunami, the ANI administration undertook massive humanitarian interventions in the southern Nicobar Islands. This article analyses the post-tsunami sociocultural change among the Nicobarese against the backdrop of the humanitarian aid administration that began in December 2004. The article specifically inquires into the post-tsunami strategic-spatial interventions in the Nicobarese ecological niche and argues that the change after the tsunami has been tacitly engineered through humanitarian interventions.||Ajay Saini
16-10-2015||commentary||---------||A Flawed Climate Road Map :||India submitted its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution on 1 October. The policy document on climate change has received laurels from diverse quarters. INDC justifies the projected rise in India's emissions by emphasising the country's development imperatives. This obscures the fact that the well-off will stamp their ecological footprint and the country will justify the rise in its emissions by hiding behind the poor.||Ashish Kothari,Nagraj Adve
08-10-2015||commentary||---------||China's Falling Rate of Profit and the Coming Economic Crisis :||China's rapid growth has been based on the intense exploitation of the working class, ruthless environmental degradation, and exports to the global capitalist market. However, all three conditions required for China's capital accumulation have been undermined. The contradictions of Chinese capitalism have led to a falling profit rate, which at current trends may soon fall towards levels historically associated with the Great Depression. A major economic crisis may seriously undermine the political legitimacy of China's current capitalist regime.||Minqi Li,Zhi Li

25-09-2015||commentary||---------||'Will Eat Anything That Moves' : Meat Cultures in Globalising India||The singular focus on cultural aspects of food habits in India--meat eating and its associated sociocultural meanings--has rendered the debate on animal vulnerability invisible. While many countries are now seeking a way out of large-scale livestock farming and animal foods due to ecological concerns as well as animal rights, India perversely is doing the opposite.||Krithika Srinivasan,Smitha Rao

This piece focuses on the operational aspects of the report and scrutinises the efficacy of the measures it proposes.||K Vishnu Mohan Rao
23-07-2015||special articles||---------||Appraising the Debate on Biodiversity Conservation in the Western Ghats :||This critical review and comparison of the Gadgil and Kasturirangan panel reports on the Western Ghats highlights various concerns related to their methodology, recommendations, and the manner in which they resolve the contradictions between the imperatives of environmental protection and economic development. It also focuses on basic demographic data on the affected areas in the Western Ghats, statistics on agricultural land use, and occupation data of the affected population in the ecologically sensitive zones, none of which has been considered in the two reports. The paper argues that the constitution of expert panels for the Western Ghats is an attempt to appeal to the principles of scientific certainty for addressing the dual concerns of environment and development. The two reports have an unwitting common ground: while they are alive to environmental concerns, they ignore insights from development theory and practice. The recommendations of both the reports presume that environmental and developmental imperatives can be combined without a political debate.||Aravindhan Nagarajan,Goutham Radhakrishnan,Kamal K Murari,T Jayaraman
30-06-2015||special articles||---------||Integrated Resource Planning for Electricity Distributing Utilities in India :||Identifying the barriers that discourage the adoption of integrated resource planning by Indian power distribution companies, this paper points to feasible conditions in which these could be overcome. Using the case of the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company and the available documentation, these barriers have been classified as financial, technical and operational; for each, a possible solution is suggested. The study also identifies conditions that would be sufficient for integrated resource planning to be practised, including providing at least a specified level of electricity services, and minimising costs, environmental impacts and additional investments.||antonette D'sa

22-05-2015||special articles||---------||Cast(e) on the Hill : ‘Divine’ Power, Social Cohesion and Hierarchy in Himachal Pradesh||Caste has often been viewed as a system of hierarchy based on the religious ideology of the Hindus with a common structure across the subcontinent. Based on an extensive empirical study of Himachal Pradesh, this paper shows how caste actively articulates with the given realities of ecology, economy and the local histories of political regimes. Even though inequality and untouchability exist, their structures have specific regional forms. While it documents the everyday practices of faith and their local specificities, the ethnographic accounts presented in the paper also have implications for our understanding of Hinduism in the present-day context.||Surinder S Jodhka
15-05-2015||commentary||---------||Ecologies of Suffering : Mental Health in India||This article proposes an "ecology of suffering" which mediates between the sufferer and the "clinic." "Ecology" refers to the network of forces acting on and by the people suffering and those around him/her. It is chosen to stress the mix of "natural," and "social" such as landscapes or air pollution. "The clinic" refers to what happens locally between the sufferer and mental health professionals attempting to actualise the National Mental Health Policy. The aim is to enhance a crucial, yet neglected, aspect of India's National Mental Health Programme: that individual mental suffering is related to a wide range of local factors.||Clement Bayetti,MAAN BARUA,Nanda Kannuri,Sumeet Jain,Sushrut Jadhav

16-04-2015||special articles||---------||Capitalisation of Nature : Political Economy of Forest/Biodiversity Offsets||Trading in environmental commodities like various forms of "offsets" has started with its questionable premise that any loss or damage to environment at a particular space-time can be offset by a supposedly pro-environmental action in another space-time through the mediation of capital and market. In India, a rather disguised offset process known as compensatory afforestation has taken off under state and judicial patronage quite some time ago. Besides, India also has the strong credential of having hosted a more common form of offset trading in the Clean Development Mechanism. Referring briefly to both but discussing mainly the philosophy and practices of various forms of offset markets in vogue, this article tries to show that this concept is in sync with the evolution of capital and capitalism in history.||Soumitra Ghosh

19-02-2015||special articles||---------||Health Aspects of the Environmental Impact Assessment Process in India||Impact assessments are conducted with the objective of safeguarding human health and the environment. The Environmental Impact Assessment notification of 2006, subsequent amendments and associated guidelines provide the framework to document untoward effects of proposed industrial and developmental projects on the environment, and to manage them. It is also implicitly understood that the notification covers human health concerns arising from the proposed projects. Are health concerns being adequately accounted for when projects are provided clearance? Through the use of a standardised framework, several gaps were found in health-related aspects of the notification and the two evaluated EIA reports analysed here. Further reflection is called for on the purpose of EIAs to prevent human health from becoming a casualty on the path to "development".||Adithya Pradyumna
19-02-2015||special articles||---------||Lower Pollution, Longer Lives : Life Expectancy Gains if India Reduced Particulate Matter Pollution||India's population is exposed to dangerously high levels of air pollution. Using a combination of ground-level in situ measurements and satellite-based remote sensing data, this paper estimates that 660 million people, over half of India's population, live in areas that exceed the Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standard for fine particulate pollution. Reducing pollution in these areas to achieve the standard would, we estimate, increase life expectancy for these Indians by 3.2 years on average for a total of 2.1 billion life years. We outline directions for environmental policy to start achieving these gains.||Anant Sudarshan,Anish Sugathan,Janhavi Nilekani,Michael Greenstone,Nicholas Ryan,Rohini Pande

In hill societies where an ecological sense of place shapes and reflects upon a sense of identity, the reconfiguration of place itself due to new mobilities is significant for such an analysis.||Bhoomika Joshi

The health impacts of air pollution from these coal-fired power plants include numerous premature deaths and frequent asthma attacks. In the future, the amount of power generated from coal will remain high, at least through 2030, and unless we fi nd a better way to manage these power plants, the environmental effects of growing air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and the cost to human health will all be high.||Debi Goenka,Puja Jawahar,Sarath Guttikunda
