In the context of the controversial recommendations made by the T S R Subramanian Committee to ease environmental norms and dilute people's participation in environmental governance to stimulate economic development, the article takes a critical look at the functioning of the Environmental Impact Assessment regime in India since its inception in 1994.||Kanchi Kohli,Manju Menon

This article examines whether GDP is an incompatible policy objective or outcome when balanced with GNH's equitable and sustainable economic progress, good governance, ecological protection and cultural preservation policy objectives.||Michael Givel
09-12-2015||perspectives||---------||Conservation 'Wars' : Global Rise of Green Militarisation||Wildlife conservation is increasingly being portrayed as a "war," where conservation organisations take moral positions against poaching. Military methods are being heavily used to complement the already existing fences. The discourse advocating militarisation largely ignores the complex underlying historical, social, economic and political drivers of poaching. This article argues that militarisation in conservation is problematic not just from a philosophical position but also has significant practical implications on the ground upon which conservation projects operate.||Trishant Simlai

03-12-2015||special articles||---------||Towards Methodologies for Multiple Objective-Based Energy and Climate Policy||Planning for India's energy future requires addressing multiple and simultaneous economic, social and environmental challenges. While there has been conceptual progress towards harnessing their synergies, there are limited methodologies available for operationalising a multiple objective framework for development and climate policy. This paper proposes a "multi-criteria decision analysis" approach to this problem, using illustrative examples from the cooking and buildings sectors. An MCDA approach enables policy processes that are analytically rigorous, participative and transparent, which are required to address India's complex energy and climate challenges.||Radhika Khosla,Srihari Dukkipati,Navroz K Dubash,Ashok Sreenivas,Brett Cohen

Since the normative goals of a polity and political contingency are in a perpetual struggle in India, the time is appropriate for us to visit the UCC debate with a view to strengthening our constitutional democracy. This article after presenting an overview of the debate suggests that there are mainly two paths to follow to meet this aspiration: (i) changing the ecology of laws relating to women, and (ii) adopting the common civil code that is prevalent in Goa.||Peter Ronald deSouza

A critical discussion of the history of settlement, plantations and accumulation in the region suggests that they need to acquire a share in the income from ecologically-sensitive tourism and from a tea that has a brand and therefore higher value, as also from better education in institutions established under corporate social responsibility activities.||Elizabeth Joseph,K T Rammohan,Swathi Soman
29-10-2015||perspectives||---------||Silencing Caste, Sanitising Oppression : Understanding Swachh Bharat Abhiyan||The Hindu notions of purity and pollution, inextricably linked with the caste system and the practice of untouchability, underlie the unsanitary practices in Indian society. These beliefs perpetuate the oppression of the "polluted castes," who are forced to undertake manual scavenging, unclog manholes and clean other people's filth. The availability of cheap Dalit labour to do these dehumanising jobs can be cited as one of the reasons why development of toilet facilities and a modern garbage and sewage management system have been neglected so far. As long as the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan attempts to delink the relationship between caste and sanitation, its lofty goal of cleaning India will remain unachievable.||Subhash Gatade
21-10-2015||perspectives||---------||Green Politics and the Indian Middle Class :||Four pillars of green politics--social justice, grass-roots democracy, non-violence, and respect for diversity--have become more or less established principles of Indian political parties. The integration of the environmental dimension of green politics, consisting of the twin pillars of ecological wisdom and sustainability, is in an evolutionary phase. It is likely that increasingly this integration will reflect the views of the growing Indian middle class.||Ashok K Lahiri
21-10-2015||special articles||---------||Post-Tsunami Humanitarian Aid : A Trojan Horse in the Southern Nicobar Islands||Historically, the Nicobarese of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands have lived in isolation with sporadic cross-cultural contact. Relying on the traditional knowledge and the resources provided by their ecosystem, the indigenes subsisted independently in their tribal reserve until the Indian Ocean tsunami inundated the Nicobar archipelago. Post-tsunami, the ANI administration undertook massive humanitarian interventions in the southern Nicobar Islands. This article analyses the post-tsunami sociocultural change among the Nicobarese against the backdrop of the humanitarian aid administration that began in December 2004. The article specifically inquires into the post-tsunami strategic-spatial interventions in the Nicobarese ecological niche and argues that the change after the tsunami has been tacitly engineered through humanitarian interventions.||Ajay Saini

The policy document on climate change has received laurels from diverse quarters. INDC justifies the projected rise in India's emissions by emphasising the country's development imperatives. This obscures the fact that the well-off will stamp their ecological footprint and the country will justify the rise in its emissions by hiding behind the poor.||Ashish Kothari,Nagraj Adve
08-10-2015||commentary||---------||China's Falling Rate of Profit and the Coming Economic Crisis :||China's rapid growth has been based on the intense exploitation of the working class, ruthless environmental degradation, and exports to the global capitalist market. However, all three conditions required for China's capital accumulation have been undermined. The contradictions of Chinese capitalism have led to a falling profit rate, which at current trends may soon fall towards levels historically associated with the Great Depression. A major economic crisis may seriously undermine the political legitimacy of China's current capitalist regime.||Minqi Li,Zhi Li

This article explores the limited utility of the use of tactical nuclear weapons which could still prove to be catastrophic by triggering the escalation of a conventional conflict into nuclear war. An alternative could be that Pakistan and India revive the idea first proposed by India in 1949 and 1950 of a No-War Agreement. The actions forbidden could include support for cross-border militancy and military incursions across the border, as well as subversion, blockades, and disruption of river waters.||A H Nayyar,Zia Mian

The Government of Andhra Pradesh has been aggressively pursuing land pooling through a series of not-too-friendly measures to acquire land for the capital which will be located in a low- to medium-risk flood area. Where the Singapore consultancy's master plan for the new city, Amaravati, falters is in not visualising the need to accommodate low-income residents and the informal sector in the new capital, and in its exaggerated projections of employment generation in the information technology sector.||C Ramachandraiah

It prohibits child labour up to 14 years and regulates the employment of children between the ages of 15 and 18 years. But the proviso that children can help in the family occupation after school hours or in the fields, home-based work, forest produce gathering or attend technical institutions during vacations, is bound to be misused. Besides, it will also lead to reinforcing the practice of caste-based occupations.||

This paper intends providing a starting point for a conversation on the law and policy dimensions of inter-sectoral water allocation. Focusing on a specific inter-sectoral water allocation conflict in Rajsamand District, Rajasthan, it illustrates gaps in the existing law and policy frameworks and highlights multiple issues that need to be addressed. It argues that the law must go beyond just prioritising water uses and water allocation to understand the issue in a comprehensive manner.||Lovleen Bhullar,Philippe Cullet,Sujith Koonan

It became the programme to be emulated for many developing countries. But the programme was not backed up by adequate research and was jettisoned, in the early 1990s. With climate change becoming a global concern, social forestry could make a comeback provided the policymakers learn from past mistakes.||Irshad A Khan
31-07-2015||perspectives||---------||A Subaltern View of Climate Change :||In the context of the ongoing debate on climate change and the policies that nation states need to adopt to limit the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, the author poses a relevant question: instead of asking what would happen to the world if everyone were to consume energy at the level of the rich "developed" American, we can now enquire why everyone is not consuming at the level of the above-poor "developing" Indian? He also suggests that the way the poor adapt, migrate and progress provides not just a sustainable approach to climate change but also one that addresses resource use.||Dunu Roy

23-07-2015||special articles||---------||Appraising the Debate on Biodiversity Conservation in the Western Ghats :||This critical review and comparison of the Gadgil and Kasturirangan panel reports on the Western Ghats highlights various concerns related to their methodology, recommendations, and the manner in which they resolve the contradictions between the imperatives of environmental protection and economic development. It also focuses on basic demographic data on the affected areas in the Western Ghats, statistics on agricultural land use, and occupation data of the affected population in the ecologically sensitive zones, none of which has been considered in the two reports. The paper argues that the constitution of expert panels for the Western Ghats is an attempt to appeal to the principles of scientific certainty for addressing the dual concerns of environment and development. The two reports have an unwitting common ground: while they are alive to environmental concerns, they ignore insights from development theory and practice. The recommendations of both the reports presume that environmental and developmental imperatives can be combined without a political debate.||Aravindhan Nagarajan,Goutham Radhakrishnan,Kamal K Murari,T Jayaraman

The Indian urban space has been considered in an undifferentiated manner, which ignores the specificities deriving from different stages of urban development, the sources of water, as also the diverse nature of aquifers catering for urban settlements in different parts of the country. This paper advances a series of hypotheses that can serve as an initial analytical framework and outlines a way forward for urban water systems, which could provide rich terrain for further research.||Himanshu Kulkarni,Mihir Shah

The returns to water management technologies range from 15% to 25% (average 21%) at the research station level, compared to 9% to 14% at the farm level (average 10.8%). Given the current rate of adoption and rate of return, the success rate of the water management technologies is only about 12%. There is therefore an urgent need to address the gaps in technology transfer and performance.||D Suresh Kumar,G Kar,K Palanisami,Kadiri Mohan,R P S Malik,S Raman

Based on an extensive empirical study of Himachal Pradesh, this paper shows how caste actively articulates with the given realities of ecology, economy and the local histories of political regimes. Even though inequality and untouchability exist, their structures have specific regional forms. While it documents the everyday practices of faith and their local specificities, the ethnographic accounts presented in the paper also have implications for our understanding of Hinduism in the present-day context.||Surinder S Jodhka

"Ecology" refers to the network of forces acting on and by the people suffering and those around him/her. It is chosen to stress the mix of "natural," and "social" such as landscapes or air pollution. "The clinic" refers to what happens locally between the sufferer and mental health professionals attempting to actualise the National Mental Health Policy. The aim is to enhance a crucial, yet neglected, aspect of India's National Mental Health Programme: that individual mental suffering is related to a wide range of local factors.||Clement Bayetti,MAAN BARUA,Nanda Kannuri,Sumeet Jain,Sushrut Jadhav

16-04-2015||special articles||---------||Capitalisation of Nature : Political Economy of Forest/Biodiversity Offsets||Trading in environmental commodities like various forms of "offsets" has started with its questionable premise that any loss or damage to environment at a particular space-time can be offset by a supposedly pro-environmental action in another space-time through the mediation of capital and market. In India, a rather disguised offset process known as compensatory afforestation has taken off under state and judicial patronage quite some time ago. Besides, India also has the strong credential of having hosted a more common form of offset trading in the Clean Development Mechanism. Referring briefly to both but discussing mainly the philosophy and practices of various forms of offset markets in vogue, this article tries to show that this concept is in sync with the evolution of capital and capitalism in history.||Soumitra Ghosh

The Environmental Impact Assessment notification of 2006, subsequent amendments and associated guidelines provide the framework to document untoward effects of proposed industrial and developmental projects on the environment, and to manage them. It is also implicitly understood that the notification covers human health concerns arising from the proposed projects. Are health concerns being adequately accounted for when projects are provided clearance? Through the use of a standardised framework, several gaps were found in health-related aspects of the notification and the two evaluated EIA reports analysed here. Further reflection is called for on the purpose of EIAs to prevent human health from becoming a casualty on the path to "development".||Adithya Pradyumna

Using a combination of ground-level in situ measurements and satellite-based remote sensing data, this paper estimates that 660 million people, over half of India's population, live in areas that exceed the Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standard for fine particulate pollution. Reducing pollution in these areas to achieve the standard would, we estimate, increase life expectancy for these Indians by 3.2 years on average for a total of 2.1 billion life years. We outline directions for environmental policy to start achieving these gains.||Anant Sudarshan,Anish Sugathan,Janhavi Nilekani,Michael Greenstone,Nicholas Ryan,Rohini Pande

It also touches upon factors influencing livelihoods such as source of irrigation, crop yield, forest produce collection, and livestock holdings to examine the respondents' socio-economic conditions. The findings revealed that the land received by the beneficiaries was very meagre in proportion to what they claimed. Besides, the study once again reiterates that forest cover was not disturbed as feared by those opposing this Act simply because no new land in the forest was given to the claimants. The land in fact was just recognised legally with the help of documents as proof that they have been occupants for long or at least from 2005 onwards. However, for those who got legal recognition over their land, it has boosted their confidence. They now feel the real ownership of their plots which led to investing in their lands without any fear about secure livelihoods.||Madhusudan Bandi

Providing access to sanitation facilities in rural areas of India has been on the agenda of the Government of India for the past three decades. However, a reinvigorated thrust to provide adequate sanitation facilities in rural India is the need of the hour, which must be accompanied by constant scrutiny and monitoring, so as to arrive at apt decisions and policies for further action.||Arjun Kumar

It finds that the incidence of water-related diseases and their economic impact on households is reasonably high. The quality of water was identified as a major problem in all the selected localities of the city. Leaking pipes, water storage and the slow movement of water during transmission and distribution contribute to health problems, especially for the poor.||A S Bhullar,Jasdeep Kaur Bedi,R S Ghuman

While few would characterise the "Lima Call to Climate Action" as a resounding success, given the deep differences that plague the climate negotiations, the Lima call represents progress and will stand countries in good stead as the drum roll for Paris begins.||Lavanya Rajamani

In hill societies where an ecological sense of place shapes and reflects upon a sense of identity, the reconfiguration of place itself due to new mobilities is significant for such an analysis.||Bhoomika Joshi

The health impacts of air pollution from these coal-fired power plants include numerous premature deaths and frequent asthma attacks. In the future, the amount of power generated from coal will remain high, at least through 2030, and unless we fi nd a better way to manage these power plants, the environmental effects of growing air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and the cost to human health will all be high.||Debi Goenka,Puja Jawahar,Sarath Guttikunda

31-12-2015||commentary||---------||Maharashtra's Water Politics : Fate of the Regulatory Authority||Maharashtra was the first Indian state to legislate an independent water regulatory authority in 2005. This decision was driven as much by the World Bank-promoted water sector reforms as by domestic politics. Irrigation backlogs and regional imbalances have been the main feature of water politics whose roots go back to the formation of the state. The state government's desire to prioritise water allocation for industrial use in its State Water Policy 2003 met with strong resistance from people in Vidarbha. Although irrigation was eventually prioritised above industry, politics also led to the undermining of the independent water regulatory authority legislated as an essential element of the water sector reforms.||Paromita Goswami

There are good reasons to expect that as a source of energy, it will only become less important—in particular the high costs of constructing and operating nuclear reactors and rapidly decreasing costs of renewable energy.||
