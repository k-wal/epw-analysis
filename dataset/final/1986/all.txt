The proposed method of analysis allows the author to test whether inequality is increasing or decreasing on average or whether it is changing due to mobility in the sample. Also tested are the commonly made assumption of 'time homogeneity', i e, transition probabilities remain constant over time, and whether an individual farm that does well in one period does even better in the next period.||P.

In the Andhra Pradesh village private moneylenders are an important source of credit, whereas in the Maharashtra village co-operative societies and land development banks play an important role. Institutional credit is concentrated in the richer households having large farm and family size, and headed by more educated, older heads. On the other hand, those households who farmed more land but were less educated, and had fewer livestock and more irrigated area relied more heavily on informal credit. Borrowers usually succeed in diverting credit from the stipulated purpose to others. The largest defaulters are those households who have borrowed most from institutional sources. Relatively, households with larger families and higher dependency ratios are more prone to default.||M. J. Bhende

In Tripura over 10,039 hectares of land are under jhum cultivation a decade ago. Over the years the jhum economy has undergone many changes-land available for jhuming has decreased; leading to a shortening of the jhum cycle and a fall in incomes. Not only has the plight of the existing jhumias deteriorated, but a new group of jhumias has emerged due to the several 'development' programmes whose plight is even worse. The government has made some efforts at resolving the problems of the jhumias.||Malabika Dasgupta

For economic analysis, it is necessary to have some idea of the changes over time in aggregate household final consumption in nominal and real terms, of the shifts in the structure of consumption by the major categories of use and of the continuing movements in the size distribution of the aggregate at current prices and also preferably in real terms. Against this requirement, NSS furnishes some information only on the structure by categories of use and the size distribution at several points of time at current prices only. The National Accounts Statistics furnish more continuing information on the structure by categories of use both at current and at constant prices and this information is independent of NSS data. The NSS, however, remains the major source of information on the size distribution at current prices, but the data thrown up do not help one to have a clear notion of its shifts over time. Finally, the NSS information on the structure by use categories differs from that given in the National Accounts Statistics.||M. Mukherjee

It analyses, in particular, the possibilities of stimulating and making more productive use of household saving-the major component of domestic saving-through a more active and promotional role of the banking system and its development orientation. It is essential for the sound development of the financial structure to avoid inflationary pressures; for this purpose, the paper stresses the significance of financial planning and suggests the relevance of the flow-of-funds framework for financial planning and also as an indicator of appropriate financial policies. In the final section, the major conclusions relating to the broad policy guidelines for domestic resource mobilisation are stated somewhat tersely.||V. V. Bhatt

While the awareness of a shared status stands them in good stead vis-a-vis the upper castes, the traditional cleavages and rivalry within have shown no signs of attentuation. This paper examines the manner in which the Mala and the Madiga, the two major untouchable castes of Andhra, have progressed during the three decades of preferential treatment. Any policy of protection and preference which operates along an ascriptive principle will inevitably bring to the fore micro-cleavages even as it succeeds at the macro level, as it has done in the case of the Mala and Madiga.||Uma Ramaswamy

On the other hand, the question has been raised by others whether there is not some role for 'demand' as a factor constraining growth. The aim of this paper is to provide a systematic empirical test to identify the years (if any) in which the Indian industrial sector was demand constrained and those in which it was supply constrained.||Ashok Kumar Lahiri,Prannoy Roy

This has given rise to the belief that men alone were capable of militant action, of leadership, of changing the course of events and, in short, of making history. Women, when mentioned at all, have been portrayed as followers or supporters in these struggles. This article is based on a study of the Warli revolt of 1945-47 which seeks to highlight the specific nature and extent of participation of tribal women in the struggle. It also discusses the more general issues relating to the policy and programmes of the Kisan Sabha, which led the Warli struggle, and of the CPI in that period.||Indra Munshi Saldanha

This view has recently received the support of even the Chakravarty Committee on the working of the monetary system. The first two sections of the paper focus primarily on the behaviour of banks and the processes of money creation and inflation, on the assumption of a given monetary policy-complex, notably a given spectrum of interest rates; Section III explores briefly the effect upon inflation and distribution of income of a rise in the interest rate or government securities.||Prabhat Patnaik
18/10/1986- ||special articles||4376236||The Unfinished Struggle of Santhal Bataidars in Purnea District, 1938-42||In recent years the countryside in Bihar has been convulsed by severe agrarian tensions arising to a large extent from the deliberate negligence on the part of the government of issues affecting the interests of oppressed sections, such as tenants-at-will and agricultural labourers. The persistence of the problems of these sections is an outcome of the failure of the Indian National Congress to effectively integrate agrarian issues with its programme for attaining Independence. This argument has been demonstrated here by examining in detail the struggle of the Santhal "bataidars" (sharecroppers who were tenants-at-will) against their maliks (comprising tenure-holders and occupancy tenants) in Dhamdaha revenue circle in the western part of Purnea district between 1938 and 1942. The conflict occurred in a political environment dominanted partly by the national movement and partly by the struggles of the upper layers of the tenantry against the zamindars in Bihar. The capacity of the Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha and the Congress to take up the problems of tenants-at-will has been critically examined, and a point of view that endorses the latter's position giving primacy to the campaign against colonial rule, while postponing the solution of agrarian issues till the attainment of Independence, has been questioned. The conflict between the Santhal "bataidars" and their maliks has been examined in the context of the ecological setting in which the two groups came to be involved in a common scheme of production relations. It has been argued that the principal shortcoming of much of the work on agrarian struggles in Bihar during the period of British rule in the twentieth century is the failure to postulate a clear picture of agrarian differentiation based on the unique features of the pattern of production relations in the area of conflict. While emphasising the unique elements of class relations in Dhamdaha, including the capacity of the Santhal "bataidars" to pilot their own struggle, the limitations of regarding them as an autonomous group have been stressed.||Anand Chakravarti

14/6/1986- ||special articles||4375797||Economics vs Stigma: Socio-Economic Dynamics of Rural Leatherwork in UP||Increasing exports of Indian leather and leather goods in recent years have been matched by a growing interest in the potential for realising further quantitive and qualitative growth. In this context, the development of this traditional industry-based on a widespread natural resource-holds out considerable promise of employment generation in rural areas. Yet, while macro-level trading figures draw attention, there remains a wide gap in our knowledge of vital factors at the village level on which the entire industry is based-the organisation and activities of rural leatherwork, the pattern of employment and the economic returns. Substantial changes have occurred in the traditional village-based leather industry over the past 140 years. Caught in the vice of rapid techno-economic changes in the leather industry on the one hand, and relatively slow social liberalisation in rural areas on the other, rural leatherwork has seen a very substantial proportionate decline in the numbers of persons engaged in the activity. While the traditional social stigma attached to persons engaged in the activity has contributed to this decline, economic factors have also played an important part. Conversely, there is evidence to show that wherever skills for the production of modern goods have been assimilated and financial constraints overcome, the activity has flourished even in rural areas. This paper is based principally on a study of rural leatherworking in Gorakhpur, Kanpur and Meerut districts of Uttar Pradesh.||Sanjay Sinha

29/11/1986- ||special articles||4376389||Development of Capitalism in Indian Agriculture: Gujarat, 1850-1900||India's economic development has been portrayed in dualist terms by those who have argued that India's socioeconomic formation is considerably different from today's advanced countries in the early stages of their capitalist development. According to this view, by the end of the nineteenth century in India, there were enclaves of capitalist production but they were surrounded by the ocean of pre-capitalist agriculture. This article contests this view, on the basis of a study of agricultural development in Gujarat in the second half of the nineteenth century. Using England as a model of capitalism it has been argued that the differences between agriculture in India and England were not fundamental, implying two different modes of production, but were the inevitable result of contrasting historical courses of capitalist development in the two countries. By the end of the last century, the author argues, all the features one would expect to be evident in a capitalist mode of production in its early stages of development could be seen in Gujarat. The process of differentiation of the peasantry had led to the establishment of a class of capitalist farmers above the destitute direct producers. That this class was small in number is not significant for one would not expect otherwise of a capitalist mode of production in its early stages.||Cathy Chua

Despite the legislations enacted from time to time, neither industry nor the government keep proper records. Nor have the trade unions been overly concerned with this 'invisible' workforce. This report based on a sample survey of 639 workers working in 66 textile mills in Ahmedabad looks at their conditions of work, wages and sex and caste compositions. It also seeks to show that contract work which started in a small way in one of the sections would not have become so prevalent if the dominant trade union in the mills had not acquiesced to this. The article draws attention to the lack of data on almost every aspect of contract labour. There are in fact no reliable estimates even of the numbers of contract workers in the country.||Sujata Patel

Yet, both have lagged. In the growth of yields, coarse cereals have kept pace with overall foodgrains, but they have lost relatively in area. Yields of pulses have been stagnant, but their loss in area is not so sharp. In spite of their 'inferior good' status and lower prices, coarse cereals-except small millets-have fared better than pulses in the growth of production and yields. It is contended here that the factors behind their slow growth or stagnation cannot be any 'permanent constraints' like higher instability, limited demand and lower value per unit. The major constraint affecting their growth is technological, viz, their lower yields and lower responsiveness to irrigation and fertilisers. There are also institutional constraints in improving productivity of dry farming and in promoting lightly irrigated cultivation as against intensive irrigation.||M. V. Nadkarni

22/2/1986- ||special articles||4375369||Urbanisation in India: Review and Prospects||Developing strategies for management of rapid urban growth constitutes a major challenge for development-planners and policy-makers. The strategies must satisfy two essential conditions. First, they must contribute to meeting the needs for gainful employment, housing, and essential services of the rapidly increasing urban population at acceptable economic and social cost. Second, they must ensure that urban growth contributes to national and regional economic growth, particularly through multiple, growth-inducing urban-rural interactions. The strategies will require advances in several directions, but principally in developing (a) a spatial pattern of urbanisation that is better adapted to the economic and social conditions of India than the one which has been allowed to develop during the last several decades; (b) lower-cost technologies of construction and of delivery of urban services; and (c) suitable political and administrative structures for management of large urban systems. This paper is divided into six parts. In part I, trends in the growth of the urban population during the 30-year period 1951-81 and the projections of the growth to the end of the century, contained in the World Development Report 1984, are reviewed. Part II discusses the strategies of dispersed industrial development and urbanisation which have formed the basis of official policies since the early 1960s. Part III discusses the issue of resources of finance and management for urban administration and for undertaking the needed programme of expansion of housing and urban services. The reasons for grossly inadequate resource-allocation during the last three decades and the prospect of more adequate resource inputs in future are discussed. Part IV and V are devoted to discussion of the problems of the maintenance of peace and security and of environmental pollution in the cities. The problems of the four giant cities-Bombay, Calcutta, Madras and Delhi-are discussed very briefly in Part VI against the background of projections of increase in their populations by two or three times during the 20-year period, 1980-2000, made by the authors of the World Development Report 1984. The question is raised whether it will be possible to cope with the pressures created by such rapid growth on urban systems which are already so greatly over-strained.||V. Nath

The early transport difficulties and the absence of any business sense among the indigenous Assamese are other impediments usually mentioned to account for the decades of lean time for British investment. In the midst of such formidable odds the heroic role of the modern entrepreneur is then stressed and homage is paid to the men whose energy and enterprise not only brought success to the business enterprise, but also brought the isolated and undeveloped tropical land into the world of exchange and thus stimulated production and raised the standard of living of the inhabitants. A close study of the records of the Assam Company, the pioneer joint stock company in the cultivation and manufacture of tea, together with other relevant contemporary material throws doubt on this simple 'explanation', and makes one reopen the subject of early British investment in India for fresh investigation.||Kalyan K.

Since the sixties the government policy has been definitely favourable to the growth of this archaic system. Contract labour which accounts for a significant proportion of the total labour force in the large-scale industries is also the most disgruntled and the most militant. The contract labour force often consists predominantly of depressed sections of society and populist movements in the region often find good support here. In 1982 there were over 11,600 contract labourers working in the Rourkela steel plant in different jobs such as loading and unloading, metallurgical maintenance, cleaning of machinery and miscellaneous other low grade tasks. This sample study of 155 workers not only draws attention to the poor conditions of work but also to some of the contradictions which trade unions face in making demands appropriate to contract labour.||

In this paper, the evaluations of the impact of Operation Flood at the village level are discussed. The two studies analysed are questioned on the grounds that their samples are unsatisfactory, the data presented is insufficient, comparisons are made on the basis of data that is not comparable, a bias in favour of the programme evaluated affects objectivity, and the conclusions do not follow from the data. Suggestions are put forward of some ways in which these defects can be reduced in future evaluations of the programme.||Shanti George

Some analysts have however noted that official projections have tended to reflect an optimistic picture of possible rapid demographic change while others have consistently underlined the much slower pace of the expected change. The latest document which traces three population projections over the next twenty years published by the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, in contrast to the earlier estimates, appears to underscore the creeping harsh reality of the unique demographic dynamics in a gradually developing economy such as India's.||Mahinder Chaudhry

In the north east however, more particularly in Meghalaya, the traditional kinship-based land relations have largely been preserved. Even though private ownership has emerged to some extent, especially in urban and semi-urban areas, only comparatively rarely does land appear to be acquired or disposed of through purchase or sale. The paper looks at the precise nature of this process of preservation of traditional land relations as they have unfolded in Meghalaya.||M. K. Sukumaran Nair

Although the tide of Tebhaga receded as fast as it rose, the uprising stands out as one of the most important political events in twentieth century Bengal. Among the unique features of the movement is the large-scale participation of women on par with men. The landless and poor peasant women formed fighting troops called nari bahini and took a front rank role in defending the gains of the movement and in countering the repression of the state. The article describes and analyses the role of women in the Tebhaga movement and seeks to throw light on fundamental questions such as why, despite women's demonstrated capacity to organise, struggle and lead progressive movements, male dominance remains unbroken.||Peter Custers

18/1/1986- ||special articles||4375224||Transferring a Political Theory: Early Nationalist Thought in India||To understand nationalist politics in the third world, it is necessary to make an explicitly critical study of the ideology of the nationalism. Both sociological determinism and functionalism have sought to interpret nationalist ideology by emptying it of all content. The author's position, on the contrary, is that it is the content of nationalist ideology, its claims about what is possible and what is legitimate, which gives specific shape to its politics. When the political theory of the modern nation-state, which clearly shares the same discussive premises with all of post-Enlightenment European social thought, is transferred to the arena of nationalist thought in the colonies, what happens to the thematic and the problematic, those essentialist typologies and the notion of the Orientals (the colonised peoples) as non-sovereign, non-active? The answer to this question would give a crucial means of access into the fundamental shifts in discursive practices which accompany the transference of the political theory of nationalism to the colonial world. The complexities of this transference are examined here by considering the writings of Bankimchandra Chattopadhyay.||Partha Chatterjee

It involves an analysis/description of the last stage of the Dutch colonial formation-in particular, the significance of the State in the world's largest plantation economy. Then ensues an account of the specific effect of Independence on this socio-economic formation, that produced neither a 'neo-colonial' or 'post-colonial' society nor a socialist transition. Influential views on the 'non-revolutionary' outcome of the Indonesian Revolution are presented but the paper's analysis suggests that it was truly revolutionary after all. The colonial system was destroyed. Subsequent events did not construct a viable replacement until after the military coup of 1965-66.||Alec Gordon
25/10/1986- ||review of women studies, october 1986||4376264||Gender in Economics: The Indian Experience||The recognition of the possibilities of bias, ought in a truly scientific endeavour, lead to corrective measures. However, when the dominant perspectives themselves are not free from that bias, both the recognition and the correction do not take place. The dominant perspective reflects the inherent power base that leads to that dominance. This article highlights the aspects of reality that tend to get camouflaged, in particular, the reality pertaining to women, in an analysis conducted within dominant perspectives. It examines the extent to which 'gender' as an analytic category has been incorporated into economic science, like other categories like class, race, ethnicity or caste. After defining the concept of gender in the different paradigms of research, the author reviews the thrust areas which economists in women's studies have been concerned with and contrasts the treatment of these issues in mainstream research with those in women's studies.||U.

Facts analysed in this paper tell a different story. In view of several observed limitations of the New Agricultural Strategy the present writer thinks that it is high time to consider a further change of strategy. It is suggested that the new technology can be applied much more fruitfully if different categories of agricultural producers can be organised as co-operative farming societies, the types of which are suggested here. Some important developmental implications of the suggested approach are also analysed.||Suman Sarkar

The analysis is carried out in terms of the five categories for which estimates are presented by the CSO, namely, (i) compensation of employees, (ii) interest, (iii) rent, (iv) profits and dividends, and (v) mixed income of self-employed defined as income of own account workers and profits and dividends of unincorporated enterprises. Changes in the relative shares of factor incomes for three years, i e, 1960-61, 1970-71 and 1981-82, are first noted and then the trend coefficients on the basis of the relevant data for each of the years from 1960-61 to 1981-82 are worked out by the regression method. The analysis relates, first, to the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors; second, to the organised and unorganised sectors; and, finally, to the public and private sectors.||J. C. Sandesara,T. R.

29/11/1986- ||review of management, november 1986||4376382||Microelectronics for Small-Scale Production||The problems of small-scale production and industrialisation in the past have been manifold: lack of local purchasing power, inadequate credit facilities, poor infrastructure and ill-equipped local institutions, etc. These handicaps coupled with competition from large-scale mass production of goods has kept decentralised production in check. With the advent of microelectronics and its application to industry in the 1970s and 1980s, mass production of standardised products has been replaced by smaller batch production of more differentiated products. This development has been inspired by the flexibility and miniaturisation of the new technology. It is yet too early to assess in any meaningful sense the empirical (and operational) experience either in advanced or developing countries. The analysis in this paper is, therefore, speculative, based on scanty information of specific industries using particular types of new technologies. Beginning by presenting the arguments in favour of the use of new technology in small-scale production, the author attempts to examine some actual experiences in both advanced and developing countries. In the light of this, the potential and limitations of the use of new microelectronics technology for promoting small-scale decentralised production in developing countries are described.||A. S.

The evidence of increasing risks associated with groundnut farming is reviewed and some of the underlying causes of variability of prices and incomes are discussed. Problems of instability in the groundnut market are important for government pricing policies and market intervention in the form of commodity stabilisation programmes. Trends in yield, output and area under groundnuts are analysed for structural breaks in the underlying trends in growth. Measures of variability in prices and incomes are studied in the context of stagnation and possible reasons for this high volatility in the groundnut market are examined. Price adjustment mechanisms in the groundnut market, given the pattern of intermediation, are also discussed.||Dipankar Purkayastha,Alka Subramanian

An attempt is made to decompose the observed aggregate changes into those attributable to the devaluation package and those determined by other concurrent parametric changes. It is found, contrary to popular belief, that the Indian devaluation was contractionary in terms of aggregate output and consumption, and that there is little evidence of an inflationary outcome. The paradoxical conclusion is reached that the observed expansion of the economy was primarily because of the unprecedented agricultural failure that occurred during the period.||Pronab Sen

13/12/1986- ||special articles||4376440||NGOs, the State and World Capitalism||What is new in the current renewed on the role of the non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the development process is the emerging view in global corporate sectors, shared in large measure by Rajiv Gandhi's government, according to which a freshly conceived private sector, including the NGOs, provide the new frontier of a dynamic technological integration of the world economy. This is to be achieved through a wide diffusion of liberalised, privatised efforts that is then drawn towards a single market for which the vast hinterlands are opened up, new (including intermediate) technologies are introduced in them and a high rate of economic surplus is generated for the metropolitan regions and the export market, all this done efficiently, cost-effectively through cheap labour and raw materials, and in the framework of a competitive ethos which the principle of the market provides and which the state cannot. It is this is new-the rapacious drive of a transnationalised, technology-driven, capitalism which has also discovered that the earlier avenues of investment in urban industries like textiles, machine goods, steel, etc, are gradually drying up or getting too competitive and there is need to look for new frontiers that lie deep in the countryside. The earlier 'commanding heights' are giving place to new ones. For the former the state and its agencies were alright, in fact in some ways better than the private sector as the required investment in massive infrastructures could only be provided by the state. But for the latter the agencies of the state will not do. Hence, yet another shift in capitalist thinking on the role of the state.||Rajni Kothari

The study, in three instalments, pieces together in an integrated form the basics of the problems, prospects, and policy issues concerning the industry's manufacturing sector, as well as its agricultural counterpart. The first of these considered the raw jute scene, the second deals with the manufacturing sector, while the last will identify the broad policy options for rehabilitating the industry in the whole.||Goutam K.

But the traditional forms of energy, on which the poor eighty per cent of the population depend almost entirely, get virtually nothing from the Seventh Plan outlay. Clearly, the Indian State accords the very highest priority to a continuation of the rapid growth of the modern energy sector achieved during the first half of the present decade, whose benefits today accrue largely to the top 20 per cent of the population via modern industry, transport and other infrastructure serviced by modern energy forms. However, the Indian State has yet to spell out the concrete measures and instruments required for solving the many problems that beset the modern energy sector; massive investment alone will not be sufficient.||M.

The project was designed as a programme for women and by women and was aimed at 'helping solve the cooking energy crisis'. The targets were daunting. One lakh chulhas were to be installed in three months of 1983-84, 1000 training courses each of 10 days duration were to be organised to teach village women to build these chulhas and Rs nine crore was set aside for the project. By the end of 1984-85 7.56 lakh chulhas are supposed to have been built resulting in an estimated annual saving of six lakh tonnes of fuelwood. This article partly based on a survey, looks at the evidence from the field and finds that the NPDIC has not been quite the success that it has been reported to be.||Madhu Sarin

But while Keynes was not directly concerned with economic development, he was the first to present the developmental rationale of a central bank. Development economics also derives intellectual support from the applicability of his (testable) concepts, such as the fringe of unsatisfied borrowers, liquidity preference, and the multiplier. Nevertheless, the author concludes, the most influential paradigms of development economics, such as the centre-periphery dichotomy, cumulative causation, backwash and spread effects, big push, takeoff, balanced growth, human capital, choice of techniques, and unlimited labour, owe little directly to Keynes or Keynesian economics.||Anand G.

What has been the precise nature of the 'built-in depressor', the term coined by Thorner to denote the complex of agrarian relations which made it paying for landlords to live on extracting rent, usurious interest and trading profit out of an impoverished peasantry rather than go in for productivity-raising investment? What have been the circumstances under which the operation of the 'depressor' has ceased at least in certain cropping regimes in certain parts of the country and what have been the reasons for such cessation? In what ways has the development strategy followed under the Plans in the last three decades impinged upon and altered agrarian relations? And what is likely to be the reciprocal effects of the way agrarian relations have been affected upon the rate and structure of industrialisation? Finally, at the end of some quarter century of the growth of the capitalist tendency in rural areas, where are we today with respect to the so-called 'mode of production' controversy?||Utsa Patnaik

Firstly, the Science and Technology scenario and the extent of CSIR's scientific responsibility are not the same with the emergence of other scientific agencies and departments of the government. Secondly, there has been a shift in the policies of the government away from import substitution and in favour of science and technology going to the front areas instead of playing the 'catch-up game'. In the changing circumstances, the CSIR does require restructuring and reorientation of its activity and direction to emerge as the cutting edge of the country's scientific, industrial and economic effort. This paper reviews the recommendations of the committees which have so far reviewed the working of the CSIR and the action which followed these recommendations and, against this background, sets out some basic considerations which should determine the orientation of the programmes of the CSIR and the National Laboratories and the restructuring of their managements.||Baldev Singh

After reviewing the economic progress of the Charotar area from the second half of the last century and the upward socio-economic mobility of the class of middle-large farmers, the present mode of farming, organisation of labour, pattern of investment and life-style of the farming households are described. It is argued that besides the features usually associated with a capitalist mode of agricultural production-hiring in of free labour to cultivate cash crops in a capital-intensive manner-the class of dominant landholders in the Charotar tract is characterised by an entrepreneurial approach to farming, a diversification of economic activities and a new life style of leisure and consumption.||Mario Rutten

This paper enquires into the conditions prevailing in the plantation industry during its formative years, 1839-59. In those days, the Assam Company was the sole representative of this industry in India, and recruits from the Kachari tribe of Assam accounted for, unlike in later times, most of its labour force. Because of ethnic homogeneity, proximity of the plantations to their home districts and the free mobility they enjoyed, the Kachari labour force was often able to fight back and gain important concessions from the Company management. Themselves illiterate though, they made continuous efforts to settle wage rates and disputes through collective bargaining and to obtain written undertakings from the management. Keen on pushing the wages further down and on resisting labour combination, the Assam Company therefore decided after 1859 to recruit the bulk of its labour from outside Assam and keep them bonded. To facilitate this, the colonial government introduced restrictive labour legislation, thereby permitting the planters to restrict free mobility and right to combination of their labourers. Kacharis opted out of the new indenture system, even as famine-stricken people by thousands were recruited thereunder from new labour catchment areas outside Assam, during the decades that followed. Among, such new recruits were various groups of tribesmen, designated in the records as 'hill cooli', dhangar and boonah (jungle-dwelling), etc.||Kalyan K. Sircar

There was earlier an ongoing shift of savings into the organised sectors (private corporate and especially the public sector), with a quickly increasing mobilisation of savings through taxation. Afterwards the public sector relied increasingly on an expanded, nationalised banking system to mobilise household sector saving. The rising political pressures of populism and broader participation prevented the government from rising, or even constant, proportions of the new revenues it mobilised mainly through indirect taxes. The use of public sector enterprises as sources of patronage politicised management and made them a drag on the public sector finances as a whole. The limit of immediate gains through improving the financial infrastructure has now been reached and the international circumstances too are less favourable. The leadership can, therefore, no longer escape making difficult political choices if it wishes to strengthen the public sector. More efficiency in the public sector means, ultimately, an attack on one of the sources of Congress Party corruption and patronage. The easier alternative, inflation, whether produced by deficit financing or administered price rises, comports the risk of popular unrest. The ultimate political out, of failing to mobilise the resources, means, if not stagnation, at least a continuation of a slow growth path that gives little hope of satisfying the aspirations of either the consumption-oriented middle class or the subsistence-oriented masses.||Barnett R.

29/3/1986- ||special articles||4375485||Economic Crisis and the Transition from Capitalism||The current economic crisis, a slowing down of the world economy, is building up highly disruptive pressures at the most vulnerable points, particularly the Third World countries. Its epicentre is in the capitalist countries, which have not surmounted the two-century long periodic occurrence of long (Kondratiev), medium (Juglar) and short-term (Kitchin) cycles, often ending in serious crises. Over the last 135 years, industrialisation has spread rapidly. Beginning in a tiny triangle in Great Britain with less than 5 per cent of the world population, the Industrial Centre now embraces over 1,000 mn people, and the progressive rise in the rate of growth for new entrants at each phase (a doubling or trebling of the size of the population joining the Industrial Centre during each of the 50-year cycles) has set the stage for some 2,000 mn persons from the Third World to join the Centre over the next 30 to 50 years. The combination of the continued occurrence of economic crises and the emergence of Industrial Socialism has exercised profound influences on world society. It has led to the emergence of several transitional social formations, as was also the case with earlier transitions from communal systems to feudalism and from feudalism to capitalism. As intermediate stages in the transitions for communal systems and sub-systems may be characterised as post-capitalist, proto-capitalist, pre-socialist and so on. The Emergence of the Third World on the world stage had added another dimension to the process of West-centred social transition.||Surendra J. Patel
30/8/1986- ||review of management, august 1986||4376068||New Information Technologies and Developing Countries: Implications for Human Resources Development||Private firms based in the major OECD countries are under increasing pressure to expand the worldwide proliferation of their technologies, penetrate or at least retain increasingly protected markets and spread the excessive cost burden of research and development. On the other hand, the process of transferring and disseminating technology, once started, is increasingly eroding the capacity of these very firms, including the most powerful multinational corporations, to control this technology, i e, to remain in a position of technological dominance. Viewed from a Third World perspective, this situation has important strategic implications. Both governments and companies from developing countries need to strive to understand these new constraints and contradictions inherent in the prevailing concepts of global technology management in order to exploit them for their own purposes. They need to utilise much more systematically the increasing reliance of US, Japanese and European companies on technology exports as a key variable for devising and implementing viable strategies of acquiring new information technologies. Policies of human resources development have a crucial role to play in this context. In fact, any attempt to apply new information technologies in developing countries to agriculture, industry or the exploration, exploitation and use of natural resources is bound to fail as long as there are insufficient capacities for monitoring, assessing, acquiring, maintaining, adapting and redesigning such technologies. In short, improving learning and innovative capacities, both for individuals and social groups, is a basic prerequisite for any strategy to subordinate informatics to the requirements of Third World societies.||Dieter Ernst

Modern communication technology, which has arisen as a qualitatively new element, is tending to accentuate this disjunction instead of reducing it. An integrated view of culture, communication and development has thus become urgent in the context of the value disorientation or moral void emerging as the gravest and most complex problem of our times. With a view to restoring the hegemony of culture (i e, of values), it is necessary to have an interface of cultural and developmental planning. Culture must also be planned so as to respond to the new problems being thrown up by economics and politics in a dual society.||P. C. Joshi

This impression is based on an insufficient study of our procedures and practices and a failure to take notice of contemporary government audit trends in other advanced countries. We can no longer plough a lonely furrow as we have been doing during the last half a century. A first step will be to have the working of the Indian Audit Department reviewed by a small group of experts and based on their recommendations revise the Comptroller and Auditor General's (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act,1971 which is a very scrappy document that leaves out most essential things and is serving only to magnify the image of the Auditor General at the expense of his organisation.||K.

It is sometimes argued that a system in which resources are concentrated with the Centre and where the Central government enjoys the maximum discretion in its allocation, despite its other drawbacks, is better suited for effecting redistribution from the richer to the poorer States.

This paper reviews the social, economic and political processes which have operated in the region before and after Independence. Under British the policy followed by the government was compatible with the interests of the cardamom cultivators. Improvements in productivity could be achieved without disturbing the ecological balance. During the post-Independence period encroachment of forest land and the policy of regularising these encroachments has led to indiscriminate denudation.||P. Sivanandan,D. Narayana,K. Narayanan Nair

The ignorance of the tradition of the Lucknow school and of other indigenous schools has had unfortunate consequences-it has led to a growing hiatus between intellectual concerns and social concerns in the present generation. Paradoxically it was precisely during the time, the 50s and the 60s, when Western social scientists were emphasising the interdisciplinary orientation and institutional approach and were reinterpreting the concept of development that in India the issue pioneered by the Lucknow School suffered an eclipse. The roots of the Lucknow School and its founders lie deep in the anti-colonial national awakening which expressed itself in the intellectual and cultural as well as political spheres. Radhakamal Mukerjee's most important contribution in the field of social science as a whole lies in questioning the proposition that modern progress can be achieved by Westernisation by 'substitution' of Eastern by Western institutions. He was perhaps the first among Asian social scientists to question the Eurocentric approach to development and pose an alternative model. D P Mukerji was one of the first among world intellectuals to take note of the powerful forces of anti-intellectualism in the socialist movement. According to DP, Indian socialism had to come to terms with Indian tradition and Indianise itself. He also explored the vital link between economy and culture in the context of the planning of the national economy. His analysis of the problem of cultural unity and social processes need fresh consideration by social scientists and policy makers in view of the new challenges being posed. The contributions of Radhakamal Mukerjee and D P Mukerji need to be studied afresh to explore how far the questions raised by them are still valid and how far the approach they offered is relevant to cope with the complexity of entirely new questions relating to India's development.||P.

The paper begins with a brief reference to the 1985-86 Union Budget which helps to trace current official thinking on issues having a bearing on the external viability of the economy. The variables in the economy considered to be crucial in determining its international economic standing are next analysed to bring out the role of the international economy in regard to domestic development policy. In the concluding section of the paper, the underlying rationale of the policy options recently exercised by the government is spelt out and it is concluded that the rationale is far removed from the requirements of autonomous, non-dependent development.||Sunanda Sen

However, there is danger that, because of its rather uncritical market orientation, it may prove a disastrous landslide. There can be no doubt that, in the present context of India's development, credit for purposes of government must be obtained at a subsidised rate and hence from a captive market. It will be right to indicate the limits of this captive market. Having done this, it will be equally right to emphasise that the government must obey financial discipline and stay within the limits. Evidently, even a prestigious committee of the Reserve Bank is unwilling or unable to tell the Government of India this cardinal truth. Instead, it has chosen to seek an easy solution in the market. The solution does not lie there.||V. M. Dandekar

In the zenanas they hoped to educate as well as to convert. The effort to convert was usually abandoned under the strict supervision of the male guardians of their Indian students. Even the real mission, to impart training, was hardly successful. The greatest impact of this plan was on the women missionaries themselves who, drawn from the 'surplus' of genteel single women in England, would otherwise have been competing for the few available positions of governesses. Significantly, women missionaries of the period were not only the helpmates of the imperialists but were themselves imperialists reenacting the drama of the coloniser and the colonised within the confines of the zenana.||Geraldine H.

These developments of the thirties led to a sharp polarisation between the two segments of the cultivating population which was articulated as an acute conflict between the two classes over large areas of undivided Bengal by the following decade. This paper examines the causes and extent of the restructuring of class relations in Bengal. It also looks at the situation of the labour force at the time of transfer of power and partition and the consequences of war time policies on the economy of the region.||Saugata Mukherji

Some Results from a South Indian Farm Economy Study||The controversy over 'farm size and productivity' which began more than two decades ago is continuing unabated. It has important implications for the debate on agricultural development. The following case study of agricultural production in Tiruchi district, Tamil Nadu, is intended in part as a contribution to this discussion. It is the authors' argument that the size-productivity framework may not be the most fruitful one for analysing the problem of agricultural productivity. Besides the fact that size is not necessarily the best measure of scale, their material brings out the point that scale may not always be relevant to the determination of productivity. The evidence that the authors examine suggests that intensity of cultivation and the class status of cultivating households may be more important in this regard. A methodological conclusion arising from the study is that since the ecological and historical specificities of a farm economy play an important role in the determination of productivity, it would be most hazardous to make generalisations regarding the size-productivity relationship.||Venkatesh B.

While there is no denying the fact that mass developmental programmes may account for this trend to some extent, the decreasing mobility of both the rural as well as the urban population poses a major challenge for development strategies. In an attempt to look at the population mobility in the context of development dynamics, this paper considers the interstate variations in the incidence of migrants in general and inter-state migrants in particular. The growing immobility is also examined in relation to the process of accentuation of regional imbalances.||Amitabh Kundu

Within a modified model of 'conflict', as applicable to the Indian context, any pro-poor policy must accelerate the growth of national income as a pre-requisite. The earlier policy of growth through an accelerated programme of public investments has been replaced in the recent past by dependence on increase in private investments. However, caught in the controdictions of conflict over taxation and expenditure policies to influence shares in national income, the new strategy has lost its thrust in the Budget for 1986-87. Yet the old policy has not been revived. The contradictions it had run into, which prevented the necessary resource mobilisation effort from being made, have not been resolved. The growth impulses in the economy thus face uncertain prospects and the 'conflict' over shares in national income is likely to sharpen further to the detriment of the lot of the unorganised poor.||Arun Kumar

22/3/1986- ||special articles||4375453||Dimensions of Inequality in a High Growth Region||When development is conceived of as a trend increase in the total of goods and services, underlying conflict between the interests of different groups are relegated to the background. Equity considerations, which reflect some of these conflicts, have figured in the literature in a different manner: attention is focused on discussion of 'growth with equity', implying thereby that growth is in some sense of primary interest and some equity considerations have to be added to it. The main thrust of this paper is towards treating equity as a dimension of development to be viewed in conjunction with growth. Further, different kinds of inequality generated by the development process have, it is pointed out, differing impact on the constraints on future development. Punjab in the late seventies, having experienced large changes in the level of incomes and stocks of agricultural assets in the preceding decade, is well suited for an enquiry into aspects of inequality. Section I of the paper discusses the dimensions of inequality to be examined, Section II sets out the different measures of inequality and Section III presents the data base. The results and their implications for future development and policy-making are discussed in the final Section.||Kanchan Chopra

The paper begins with an assessment of employment and skill effects of world market-oriented electronics manufacturing in South East Asia during the 1970s. It then outlines how the proliferation of computer-based automation is already transforming the prevailing modes of internationalising the electronics industry and its implications for off-shore chip assembly. In particular, the rationale underlying the recent transfer of automated electronics manufacturing activities to a select number of Third World growth poles is discussed.||Dieter Ernst

This is primarily accounted for by adverse price movements. There has been an erosion of price margin over cost. Paradoxically the faster growing non-agricultural sector is able to sustain a higher rate of price increase year after year. This deterioration in the inter-sectoral terms of trade has resulted in the immuniseration of farmers in India.||Dalip S. Swamy,Ashok Gulati

There exist some studies of fiscal incentives extended by the Central government, but those given by State governments remain an unexplored area. This paper analyses an important State fiscal incentive, the sales tax subsidy, with a view to (i) examining whether the subsidy is likely to fulfil the intended objective, (ii) studying the effect of the incentive on the allocation of resources, and (iii) quantifying the cost of the incentive in terms of the revenue forgone by the government. As a case study, the authors consider Madhya Pradesh, a backward state which has the most liberal sales tax subsidy scheme among all the states.||V. B. Tulasidhar,M. Govinda Rao

This has given rise to sporadic protests that interest rate policy has tended to become growth-inhibitive. Countering this view, it has been argued that despite the general scarcity of capital the level of interest rates in the country has been kept artificially low resulting in poor saving, absence of cost consciousness and misdirection of scarce resources. The purpose of this paper is to analyse various aspects of interest costs borne by manufacturing industries in India in order to assess the incidence of interest rates and its implication for the total cost structure of Indian industries.||K.

The utility of such an organisation is evidenced in the findings of the scholars all over the world. Despite various government pronouncements about the necessity of farmers' organisation, they are in a state of infancy in India. The relevant issues concerning farmers' organisation which are required to be resolved before such organisations are built in to the irrigation projects are as follows: 1) The Role of the Government/the Agency 2) Farmers' participation: before or after OFD Works 3) Single versus multi functions 4) One tier versus multi tier 5) Village based versus channel based 6) Lesions from indigenous systems. The paper outlines the factors contributing to the success of such an organisation. The factors deduced from a successful case of farmers' organisation studied by us earlier are: i) Good leadership; ii) Adequate and reliable water supply; iii) Greater interaction between the officials and the farmers; iv) Easy unanimity among group members; v) Inducement from the government/the agency; and vi) Legitimacy of the organisation.||Niranjan Pant

There are, however, anomalies in the data used by him. With the data corrected for the anomalies one gets an exactly opposite result. An extension of his work for the period upto 1982-83 suggests that locational shifts in fact became important in the post-Green Revolution period as area under short duration rice varieties expanded in Punjab and Haryana.||C.

The education of women, it was argued, involved a very different set of values from the rationale, for instance, behind agitating for home rule and, later, legislative representation. If women were excessively liberated there was no guarantee that they would either accept the moral straitjacket imposed on them or the sexual double standards allowed for men. These subconscious insecurities took a hysterical form occasionally as in the response to the educational and later professional successes of Kadambini, the first Indian woman doctor.||Malavika Karlekar
12/4/1986- ||special articles||4375538||Caught in Contradictions of Mixed Economy||It is evident from the Budget for 1986-87 that the Finance Minister is going neither by the recommendations of the Seventh Plan document nor by his own Long-Term Fiscal Policy statement. The government appears to be unable to generate resources from its own enterprises. It is unwilling or afraid to tax those who are rich and growing richer. It feels compelled to increase the outlay on so-called welfare measures. It is then left with no option but to fall back on indirect taxes and rely more than ever on borrowings from those who expect interest and tax concessions for temporarily parting with their resources to enable the government to continue its 'development programmes'. That simply is the fiscal 'strategy' that the 1986-87 Budget reflects. It is no strategy at all; only a matter of necessity.||C. T. Kurien

On the basis of a series of household interviews conducted in the 1980s in Wuhan and Beijing, the author suggests that the growing demand for domestic maids arises from the need of couples to take care of young and old dependents, a function that the State encourages in the absence of its own facilities for such services. Increasingly, however, the growing aspirations of women to participate in and gain from the modernisation programmes has lent a powerful motive as has the increasing emphasis on leisure activities, prompted by increase in urban incomes.||Elisabeth J.

Though based on a set of assumptions which did not adequately take into account the presence of the 'third party' and the complexity of the communal problem, it was nevertheless conceived at a crucial historical juncture and was a significant move in the right direction. Pursued purposefully, it had the potential of weaning large sections of the Muslim community away from the Muslim League. In letting the mass contact campaign peter out, the Congress allowed Jinnah, perhaps involuntarily, to take advantage of the deteriorating communal relations and rally his community around the divisive symbol of a separate Muslim homeland.||Mushirul Hasan

The facility of faster depreciation, funding of profits and lowering of the burden of capital gains taxation will help mobility of investible funds. Changes in customs duties have been made with a view to widening the market for indigenous production and removing hurdles created by the liberalised import policy. A structural change is being effected in the levy of excise duties by offering a more general facility of deducting excise duty payable on inputs used in the production of excisable goods. All this notwithstanding, unless permanent solutions are found for the problems of overstaffing and overmanning in the government and the public sector, of subsidies to affluent farmers, of the size of defence expenditure and of government expenditure generally, not only will there be no room for lowering the level of direct or indirect taxes but the inflationary rise in costs and prices arising from the unavoidable efforts at imporving the surpluses from public sector undertakings will continue. The recent increases in the prices of petroleum products, foodgrains and fertilisers are only the beginning. In the absence of monetary restraint to balance the inflationary impact of expansionary fiscal policy, inflationary forces will forge ahead.||M. P. Chitale

This paper seeks to assess the interest burden on the corporate sector against the accepted norm of marginal efficiency of capital. Data for the study are taken from the analyses of the finances of non-financial companies periodically conducted by the Reserve Bank of India and the ICICI.||K. A. Menon

It does not try to give a detailed historical account of its events, but to make sense of what happened. Do the events, beyond their quotidian diversity, show some pattern? Did Indira Gandhi's actions weaken, retard, rework, redirect the scheme of national reconstruction laid down by the earlier regime? What are their likely long-term consequences? This paper tries to ask some of these questions through a division of her term into four fairly obvious periods: 1966 to 1971, 1971 to 1975, 1975 to 1980 and from 1980 to her death.||Sudipta Kaviraj

In the meantime, the number of senior administrators in most developing countries needing intervention inputs for development has been steadily increasing with the growth in the pace of planned economic development. The environmental context of job performance by the senior administrator has also been changing along with sharp adjustments in the configuration of internal and external relationships in the growing maze of government departments. It is therefore necessary to appreciate the contemporary context as well in establishing the case for development of senior administrators, so that some prevailing concerns can be identified and pursued for implementation This paper seeks to isolate some challenges constituting the context, the range of needed intervention inputs and related issues as the underpinnings.||A.

06/9/1986- ||special articles||4376095||Importance of Female Primary Education for Fertility Reduction in India||The launching of the Seventh Plan provides an opportunity to initiate those 'beyond family planning' measures which contribute to the overall objective of fertility reduction in India. At the 1974 Bucharest Conference on Population, the Indian delegation was instrumental in introducing the oft-repeated slogan 'development is the best contraceptive'. The actual experience in India since then has rarely reflected this theme, which requires that the potential impact of developmental activities on fertility be taken account of in the design and implementation of development programmes. In this article the authors examine education sector policies and suggest modifications from the fertility reduction perspective. Does education reduce fertility? The research done so far in India and elsewhere shows that the answer is generally 'yes'. Under a few circumstances, however, women with some education, particularly if they do not complete primary school, may have marital fertility that is higher than those who have no schooling. Such evidence has sometimes given the impression that education, unless it is completed to a level higher than the primary, is not effective in fertility reduction; from this perspective, the education sector resources should be allocated to higher education. By analysing the macro- and micro-level Indian data on education and fertility, the authors demonstrate that this impression is not correct. There is convincing evidence that female education in India monotonically increases the use of contraception and age at marriage, both of which, in turn, decrease fertility. The authors argue that as far as fertility reduction is concerned, educational policy should give high priority to expansion of female primary education, particularly by reducing the currently high repetition and drop-out rates from primary schools. They also point out that while the Five-Year Plan documents of the Central and state governments have often emphasised the urgency of making female primary education universal in all states, actual budget allocations among different education sectors have not always reflected this emphasis.||Anrudh K.

22/3/1986- ||special articles||4375454||Geography of Secular Change in Sex Ratio in 1981: How Much Room for Optimism?||The 1981 Census recorded a sex ratio of 936 as against 930 of the 1971 Census. Since there had been a secular trend of decline of the sex ratio between 1901 and 1971, the 1981 sex ratio marks the reversal of a 70-year old movement and can be looked upon as a demographic revolution of sorts. It therefore becomes important to examine some regional aspects of the sex ratio in 1981 and to try to identify which are the areas in which this reversal of trend has been achieved. Has the numerical proportion of the sexes risen uniformly all over the country? Or has the rise been in pockets only? This paper is an attempt to answer this question.||Ilina Sen
25/1/1986- ||special articles||4375254||I P Desai and Sociology of India||In the four decades of pursuing sociology I P Desai examined a wide range of topics. The significance of his work lies not so much in the fact that he was more critical than his contemporaries but in the methodology he used. Whatever be the subject he dealt with he used the inductive analysis in the place of deduction. In his studies on the Indian family, he drew attention to the kinship network of family units instead of considering only their insular attributes of co-residence and commensality which was the valuation prevalent in the West. His enquiries on whether caste should be a basis for recognising backwardness are noteworthy for their rigorous research. He rejected the concept of caste as a unique or an intrinsic or a persistent phenomenon in Indian society. Examining the concepts of sanskritisation and westernisation, I P Desai found that the 'new elite' on the contrary, arises out of an amalgam of the two processes.||Ramkrishna Mukherjee

24/5/1986- ||special articles||4375709||Is the Reagan Recovery Real or the Calm before a Storm?||The international economic recovery since 1983 has been widely acclaimed as having overcome the economic problems of the previous decade through renewed growth. This claim rests on shaky foundations. In the US the recovery has been weakly sustained by consumer spending and debt finance; and internationally the spread of the recession has been slow and uneven which has exacerbated international economic imbalances and threatens the stability of the world economy in the next recession. There are many reasons to believe that the next recession may well be deeper again than the previous one, as each of the last three was than the one that preceded it in the present world economic crisis since 1967. None of the intervening recoveries overcame the accumulated legacies of the previous recessions and the present recovery has substantially aggravated the structural and cyclical problems of the world economy. The underlying weakness of the recovery in the United States; the imbalances it has exacerbated among the major economic regions of North America, Japan, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the Third World; the reliance on domestic and international finance speculation instead of real production and investment; and the virtual exhaustion of the major anti-depressive monetary, fiscal and other policy instruments to support the last recovery augur ill for the prospects of the next recession. The combination of these and other factors and the dynamic they may promote among themselves could turn the next session into a severe depression. The author argues that despite the pervading complacency and optimism in official circles, we may be on the threshold between the 1920s and the 1930s. Indeed, the complacency and especially the unfounded belief in American economic might and invulnerability are major contributing factors to the gravity of the situation, because they preclude serious analysis and effective policy. [This paper is published in two parts. This part, the first, examines the domestic US weakness and international imbalances which have characterised the recovery since 1983. The second part, to appear next week, will discuss some likely scenarios for the next world recession.]||Andre Gunder Frank

Within a short span of a decade, the RRBs have carved out a niche for themselves among rural financing agencies. For the RRBs to achieve the tasks set for them will require highly motivated personnel and a climate which is conducive to development. However, issues of personnel policies for the RRBs have on the whole received scant attention. This neglect can prove costly in the long run. This paper is an attempt to put focus on this complex area and is divided into two sections: section I focuses on the problem areas in personnel management in RRBs and section II puts forward some suggestions for improvement of their personnel policies.||Anil K.

It would be useful, therefore, to review the benefits of FPI, especially as they pertain to India. This paper begins with a brief discussion of the benefits of portfolio investment in India from the viewpoint of the foreign investor and India's need for FPI. The author then discusses the general benefits and India-specific issues of liberalisation, following which some suggestions on tapping portfolio investment are put forward.||Vihang R. Errunza

To equate them with endless calculations is to deflect the debate. To use these calculations to argue for an arbitrary 'equivalence' is based on a complete misunderstanding of the role of agriculture within the economy. Development implies a faster rate of growth of the non-agricultural sector, and to press for a mathematical parity, and that through higher agricultural prices, is to make nonsense of a critical issue. Further, the author attempts to show in this paper, the entire exercise is faulty purely in terms of its arithmetic.||Nalini Vittal

The results and analysis of the Fourth Survey in the series have been presented broadly on the same lines as those of the earlier surveys. This facilitates the construction of a continuous data-set on the financial aspects of foreign collaboration in the corporate sector and makes possible an assessment of the impact of the type of policies followed by the government. Analysis of data from the RBI Surveys suggests a link between regulation of technology import by government and lower cost of imported technology. It stands to reason thus that a policy of liberalisation like the one being currently pursued may raise the cost of foreign technical collaboration. In an environment of liberalisation there is likely to be a tendency for firms to seek technology import indiscriminately and to go in for expensive and more comprehensive package-technology with a view to gaining a competitive edge in the domestic market. As a result the Indian economy is likely to be saddled with a growing burden of foreign exchange outflow on account of technology import.||K. K. Subrahmanian

It was based on an unannounced quiet inquiry spread over a number of years which showed that neither a code of conduct nor legislation could make private insurers operate to protect the interest of the policyholders. However the Life Insurance Act gave clear evidence of the absence of any doctrinaire bias against the private sector. In the context of the new industrial policy which was then on the anvil, it was essential that nationalisation of life insurance did not give contradictory signals and tilt the power and ideological balance in the Indian economy.||Kamal Nayan Kabra

The study, in three instalments, pieces together in an integrated form the basics of the problems, prospects, and policy issues concerning the industry's manufacturing sector, as well as its agricultural counterpart. The first of these considers the raw jute scene, the second deals with the manufacturing sector, while the last identifies the broad policy options for rehabilitating the industry in the whole.||Gautam K.

He revealed his preference for the latter option. This paper seeks to raise issues for debate in the context of the larger problem of financing a step-up in public sector investment as a whole including Central and state public sector undertakings. It is argued that the choice in favour of raising administered prices is not as overwhelmingly clear as made out in official circles.||K. Sundaram,Suresh D. Tendulkar

Or, can a case be made that perhaps social forestry objectives should be modified somewhat and that with a changed set of goals there is ample scope for a flow of benefits to the rural poor? Such questions are especially pertinent at present, given the government's programme for massive afforestation of degraded lands and the release in October 1985 of a World Bank-sponsored study calling for a five-year, $ 500 million, fuelwood-agro-forestry effort in India. This paper addresses these issues, both at the national level and with special reference to Maharashtra, which has a major social forestry enterprise currently under way.||Harry W. Blair

The autobiography of Manikuntala, a front-ranking leader of the undivided Communist Party, was published in 1982. In between we find quite a few autobiographies written by Bengali women. Their accounts span the better part of two centuries. Here we have tried to trace the changes in Bengali social life as experienced by these women and as recorded in their autobiographies. The issues that we have particularly focused our attention on are the status of women in their families, the question of marriage, education and the changing aspirations of women. We have also referred to the psychological tensions and uncertainties that women had to undergo in the face of social resistance. The picture that emerges is not one of determined progress of women's emancipation led by the leaders of Bengal Renaissance but one of hesitant and uncertain advance in a period of social turmoil. These autobiographies throw new light on and add new dimensions to our understanding of the process of social change which conventional history has so far overlooked.||Srabashi Ghosh

26/7/1986- ||review of political economy, july 1986||4375935||Commercial Capital and Agrarian Relations: A Study of Guntur Tobacco Economy||This paper discusses the dynamics of tobacco cultivation and trade in Guntur region. Flue-cured virginia tobacco was introduced in India by a subsidiary of the British American Tobacco Company, the leading cigarette conglomerate. In the initial phase, the company closely supervised and controlled cultivation. This control was achieved by its monopoly of the new technology and a system of contracts between the company and the cultivators. The author examines the impact of the new crop on the agrarian structure-how it strengthened the upper stratum of the peasantry. The contract form of marketing gave way to the unregulated system of marketing around depots opened by the traders in the villages and the rich ryots found a lucrative source of accumulation in the intermediary positions opened up by the depot system. Finally, the author discusses the present-day crisis in the tobacco economy and the introduction of the system of compulsory auctioning in the marketing of tobacco. The analysis reveals how the possibilities and potential for accumulation in the tobacco economy are bounded by the choices and decisions of international capital, such as the position it has allocated to the Guntur tobacco in the international blending hierarchy, specific cultivation practices it has promoted or the alternative areas of tobacco supply it has chosen to develop. As a consequence, there has been a shift away from Flue-cured virginia tobacco in the Guntur region and a search for a new profitable crop that would partly sustain the process of accumulation.||Nata Duvvury

01/2/1986- ||special articles||4375282||Masses, Classes and the State||This paper explores the relationship between an increasingly defensive status quo desperate to retain its power and the forces of change and transformation that are getting increasingly restive and restless, conscious of the shackles that bind them and the need to move out of them, yet frustrated and disorganised and unable to cope with the growing repression and terror from the status quo. Both the need to consider the multiple dimensions of domination, exploitation and marginalisation in their interrelated manifestations and the need to similarly interrelate and integrate the large variety of countertrends and their new ideological underpinnings can be best done by working on the central issue of our time: the changing nature of the State and its role in civil society. In the state of vacuum in the traditional superstructure of the liberal polity, the author argues, the real countertrends are to be found not in the party system, not in the arena of electoral politics and of State power, not in the typical confrontation between the haves and the have-nots within the conventional economistic space dominated by trade unions. In their place there is emerging a new arena of counter-action, of countervailing tendencies, of counter-cultural movements and more generally of a counter-challenge to existing paradigms of thought and action.||Rajni Kothari

16/8/1986- ||special articles||4376017||Magnitude and Nature of Recent Depreciation of Rupee||All indices of the trade-weighted exchange rate (TWER) of the rupee show that the bit-by-bit depreciation of the value of the rupee has resulted in a significant cumulative depreciation of about 30-35 per cent in the nominal exchange rate of the rupee during 1982-86. The government's objective in effecting the small, step-by-step devaluation appears to have been to offset the higher rates of inflation in India relative to those of our trade partners. Exchange rate changes have significant implications for export competitiveness, import costs, import substitution, capital flows, inflation rates and, finally, resource allocation as between traded and non-traded goods. It is, of course, justifiable that the exchange rate should be used by the government as a policy tool. However, so far there is little evidence of any favourable effects of depreciation on the country's foreign trade. The potent tool of exchange rate depreciation, the author argues, should be used with greater openness so that the appropriateness of its use, the magnitude of exchange depreciation and also its effects on various sectors of the economy can be assessed and debated upon, in place of the guessing games which are going on today. Such openness will also facilitate the adoption of complementary measures which alone can make a nominal exchange rate depreciation effective. Finally, the business community may perceive the current ongoing 'crawling-peg' depreciation as a transient market phenomenon and, therefore, may not undertake the desired resource re-allocation measures.||S.

This is what the present paper seeks to do. While it is not possible to settle all the questions definitively, the evidence suggests that there is strong reason for being circumspect is using NSS estimates as the basis for judging trends in consumption and in the incidence of poverty.||A.

02/8/1986- ||special articles||4375972||Analytical Models of Economies and Societies: Some Implications for Inter-Disciplinary Studies of Social Classes, the State and Civil Societies||Sraffa's models of a surplus-generating and surplus-appropriating capitalist economy, first published in 1960, correct and complete Marx's own models of a capitalist economy. They correct Marx's models in two essential aspects-they dispense with the idea that these models can be portrayed in terms of direct and indirect labour 'embodied' in commodities and they also dispense with the idea that the 'surplus' is necessarily generated in every separate sector of production as a physical surplus. They complete Marx's models by bringing scarce land into the 'general' model and by bringing 'the money rate of interest' into the models explicitly. However, Sraffa's own models which try to incorporate scarce land have themselves had to be corrected. Nevertheless the corrected Sraffa models have proved astonishingly versatile making it possible for us to test with the help of 'hard' rigorously worked out Marx-Sraffa models Marx's insights of capitalist economies in their evolution.||Arun Bose

However, since partisan science is cognitively rooted in special vested interests, it tends to bias public policy decisions in their favour and against public interest. In support of this argument, the authors review the role of public interest science in environmental action in the Doon Valley and in the forest struggles.||Vandana Shiva,J. Bandyopadhyay

20/12/1986- ||special articles||4376471||Maithilisharan Gupta and the Idea of Indian Nationalism: A Centenary Critique||Viewed within the perspective of the evolution of Indian national consciousness, Maithilisharan Gupta's nationalist ideology would warrant the conclusion that though he was proud of his Hindu legacy and zealously promoted Hindu consciousness, he was not a communalist. He envisaged a free and ever progressing democratic India that would extend equal rights to all its citizens irrespective of their caste and creed. At the same time, however, like most Hindus, he was heir to a historically produced complex of feelings that did not quite square with the logic underlying the vision of such an India. Nationalist Hindus of the generations of Romesh Dutt and Maithilisharan Gupta may have, as indeed they did, entertained the virtually undefined belief that Hindu and Indian were synonymous terms. This belief contained an ominous potential that has actualised with such increasing force over the years that today we are confronted with a fearsome situation in which what was implicit and veiled not so long ago is threatening to become the pivotal principle of our nationalist ideology. In this situation, Maithilisharan's writings are likely to be read progressively in ways that would strengthen the emerging fearsome situation and lend it respectable literary-intellectual support. As we celebrate his birth centenary, we ought to beware of this dimension of Maithilisharan Gupta's legacy.||Sudhir Chandra

The author contends that the official demand forecasts are exaggerated because the assumptions about growth of traffic on which they are based are unrealistic. In the light of his demand projection, the author argues that the current policies of licensing a number of new units is likely to result in underutilisation of capacity and consequent loss of economies of scale. A preferable policy would be to increase capacity in the existing units would achieve greater efficiency and introduce some competition in the industry.||Rajaram Dasgupta

25/10/1986- ||special articles||4376270||Markets, Power and Social Norms||The fundamental theorem of welfare economics, which states that, given some conditions, individual selfishness can lead to social optimality, is one of the most misused theorems in economics. Many policies are justified by citing this theorem, or rather folklore versions of it. Several technical reasons as to why the price mechanism may fail to function efficiently are well known. This paper focuses on some more basic and 'social' qualifications of the fundamental theorem. First, it is argued that the popular assumption that individuals maximise utility "everywhere" is a meaningless one; and it can precipitate the Russell paradox. It is then argued that social norms play a crucial role in the functioning of markets. Finally it is shown that social norms, customs and even political power structures can be sustained in an atomistic market through a network of interpersonal conjectures and sanctions. It has been suggested that for understanding real-life economics it is necessary to bring institutions and power relations into our formal models. The method followed in the present essay may be viewed as one way of attempting this.||Kaushik Basu

Legislation for conferment of ownership rights on tenants was to be enacted by 1981-82. The programme for taking over possession and distribution of ceiling surplus land was to have been completed by 1982-83. Both these tasks still remain unachieved. This paper examines the present status of security of tenure of tenants and implementation of ceiling laws in different parts of the country and against this background discusses the various administrative steps and other supporting measures required for implementing land reforms.||D.

Health is a resultant of a multiplicity of factors and these put great demands on the information system that could be visualised for the health sector. It not only implies a wide base of information with inter-sectoral linkages, but a close monitoring of the progress made in the improvement of the health status. The paper outlines a framework of an information system for assessing and monitoring the level of health.||S. K. Sanyal

Its early achievements were in developing indigenous catalysts, and the design-engineering of large-scale nitric acid and calcium ammonium nitrate plants. It was also instrumental in moulding the nation's fertiliser feedstock policy-it championed the use of coke oven gas, heavy fractions of petroleum and even coal and lignite as feedstock for nitrogenous fertilisers. However, when in the wake of the Indo-Pakistan war in 1965 P and D was given the task of constructing several major fertiliser plants, it came in for unwarranted criticism from sources both within the country as well as the USAID, World Bank, the Ford Foundation, etc. This article draws attention to the undermining of efforts at creating a sound indigenous technology base in fertiliser production through a policy of favouring foreign firms and agencies.||Sailendranath Ghosh
31/5/1986- ||special articles||4375742||Is the Reagan Recovery Real or the Calm before the Storm?||The international economic recovery since 1983 has been widely acclaimed as having overcome the economic problems of the previous decade through renewed growth. This claim rests on shaky foundations. In the US the recovery has been weakly sustained by consumer spending and debt finance; and internationally the spread of the recession has been slow and uneven which has exacerbated international economic imbalances and threatens the stability of the world economy in the next recession. There are many reasons to believe that the next recession may well be deeper again than the previous one, as each of the last three was than the one that preceded it in the present world economic crisis since 1967. None of the intervening recoveries overcame the accumulated legacies of the previous recessions and the present recovery has substantially aggravated the structural and cyclical problems of the world economy. The underlying weakness of the recovery in the United States; the imbalances it has exacerbated among the major economic regions of North America, Japan, Western Europe, Eastern Europe and the Third World: the reliance on domestic and international finance speculation instead of real production and investment; and the virtual exhaustion of the major anti-depressive monetary, fiscal and other policy instruments to support the last recovery augur ill for the prospects of the next recession. The combination of these and other factors and the dynamic they may promote among themselves could turn the next session into a severe depression. The author argues that, despite the pervading complacency and optimism in official circles, we may be on the threshold between the 1920s and the 1930s. Indeed, the complacency and especially the unfounded belief in American economic might and invulnerability are major contributing factors to the gravity of the situation, because they preclude serious analysis and effective policy. [This paper has been published in two parts. This part, the second, discusses some likely scenarios for the next world recession. The first part of the paper, which appeared last week, examined the domestic US weakness and international imbalances which have characterised the international economic recovery since 1983.]||Andre Gunder Frank

The author discusses the incongruities in the ITDP administrative structure, the lack of control over resources, the complete absence of popular initiative, the non-involvement of popular bodies, and the complete failure of its monitoring system. The findings of the study also underscore the fact that developmental programmes which skirt around political issues have limited potentialities.||Dipankar Gupta

It is argued that incorporation involved a restructuring of production processes and the creation of a political entity (or entities) operating within the rules of the interstate system. In the latter case, such an entity definitely does not have to be a colonial state. Indeed, in this period, the juridical structure of India was exceptional rather than usual, and the author has sought to trace the processes by which this exception occurred.||Immanuel Wallerstein

A Reappraisal||It is simplistic to regard the ulama as standard-bearers of Muslim orthodoxy and conservatism whose concerns were limited to regulating the religious and educational life of the Muslim community. Such a view ignores the range of their involvement in other spheres, especially in organising, conducting and leading some vitally important political movements in the first four decades of the twentieth century. The ideological basis of the ulama politics also needs re-examination as a corrective to the oft-repeated notion that the Jamiyat, for instance, had exclusive communitarian concerns and its anti-colonial posture, being grounded in Islamic theology, was inconsistent with the essentially secular thrust of Indian nationalism. It is true that the ulama thought and acted within the Islamic framework, but neither the framework nor their understanding of it remained constant and unchanging. It is equally true that the future of the Muslims and of Islam were among their central concerns. At the same time, their communitarian concerns were not limited to the religious domain and to specific issues relating to the sharia, and they intervened in politics not as spokesmen of Muslims alone but of other groups as well. Their religious idiom and the use of Islamic symbols was intended to serve the secular objective of rallying the populace around the Indian national movement.||Mushirul Hasan

The overlapping co-existence of the two generalised systems of levy has not only led to a complicated structure of taxation, but, with each compounding the effects of the other through interaction, has given rise to uncontrolled and unintended incidence on particular commodities. Any serious study of the economic effect of commodity taxes at the state or the Central level must attempt to find out the cumulative rate with respect to inter-industry relationships. For want of such calculations, studies of the incidence of these taxes have given incorrect results. Also, any study of the effect of these taxes would give misleading result if only the statutory rates are taken into consideration.||Mahesh C. Purohit

This paper seeks to explain the differences in responses to public and private sources of irrigation as observed in different areas of Pubjab, differing in sources of irrigation as observed in different areas of Punjab, differing in sources of irrigation. The author finds that it is mainly and basically the differences in the pattern of land distribution that explain the differential impact of irrigation on production.||Jasveen Jairath

Today's writers and editors cannot evade the responsibility for sexist usage especially in materials specifically produced for classroom consumption. And yet, Indian textbooks continue to exude sexist bias both in terms of choice of content as well in their language. This article is based on a survey of 41 Indian school textbooks and supports the view that eliminating sexist language is an important precondition to destroying sexism in society.||Narendra Nath Kalia

Different social situations certainly require different tools of analysis, but it would be carrying specialisation too far to argue that we need as many methods as there are social situations. This point is illustrated below by showing how the method of intensive fieldwork, developed by anthropologists into a scientific skill and an art, may be employed in the study of modern formal organisations-in this particular case, a school in south India.||Meenakshi Thapan

15/11/1986- ||special articles||4376330||Sex Roles and Gender Relations in North India||The conduct of women is a particularly strong focus of social concern in those parts of India where women's seclusion is most stringently practised. Purda, which is observed over much of the northern part of the sub-continent, refers not only to specific traits of veiling and spatial separation, but, more widely, to the values about the proper behaviour of women and to the restrictions on their respectful demeanour within the home. A family can properly observe purda only if its members can afford to do so. Those whose income is not sufficient to provide separate women's space and who cannot forego women's earnings in the field or workshop are not able to support full purda. But when a formerly poor family becomes prosperous, its women are usually quite ready to adopt more stringent seclusion, partly because it is a prestigious thing to do and partly because it relieves them from grinding work for wages. And as newly affluent families take on stricter practices, families of established wealth and education commonly relinquish some of the purda restrictions. Such families tend to be urban. Village families are likely to be more stringent about women's seclusion than their class and caste counterparts in cities, though there are a good many urban families whose women do keep to purda seclusion. While the standards for purda observance vary by regional, caste and religious groupings, certain features are common to all. The author sketches these shared fundamentals and notes one of the principal variations, that between the Muslim and Hindu versions of purda.||David G. Mandelbaum

26/4/1986- ||review of women studies, april 1986||4375595||Production of an Official Discourse on "Sati" in Early Nineteenth Century Bengal||Several debates arose in the nineteenth century on the status of women in India in the context of determining an appropriate colonial policy on such matters as "sati" which were seen to mark the depressed position of women in society. The reform of these practices was held to be part of the regenerating mission of colonisation. The most sensational and the first of these debates concerned the outlawing of "sati". The literature on "sati" (and on social reform) of the period has largely adopted the framework of modernisation theory. The paper argues that the characterisation of the official debate as one between 'preservationists' and impatient westerners obscures a number of important issues. For instance, rather than argue for the outlawing of "sati" as a cruel and barbarous act, officials in favour of abolition were at pains to illustrate that the abolition would be consonant with the principle of upholding tradition. By treating the debates on "sati" as a discourse and examining its production the article contests the conclusions on "sati" drawn by colonial officials.||Lata Mani

Some of those innovations, the reliance on non-pecuniary incentives to motivate the masses to get involved in preventive health programmes, a multi-tiered network of medical care facilities, appropriate skill and training for medical personnel at different points, all have financial implications which are equally relevant to other developing countries. However, recent developments like epidemiological transition and ideological and institutional changes have raised some concern about the ability of the health care system to cope with the new demands. Moreover, recent reforms in the economic structure such as the new responsibility system, weakening of fiscal support to the rural cooperative health insurance scheme, cut-backs on state subsidies to health care and resumption of private medical practice will result in an overall rise in the cost of health care and the access to facilities are bound to become more unequal.||P.

Slowly but surely, problems have cropped up in both these structures. The states' sales tax has to be largely restricted to activities and transactions that take place within the boundary of each state. However, some of the problems which arise in putting this principle into practice cannot be solved by a few states acting independently and have to be analysed from the federal point of view or from the national angle. It is in this context that issues relating to the cascading effects of input taxation, the point of levy of sales tax and the free-flow of goods in the country are crucial. As regards the federal structure of sales tax, problems of vertical equity and the need for facilitating the growth of a common market within the Indian Union in the interest of economic development of the country have to be borne in mind.||Mahesh C.

In particular, the focus is on examining the empirical basis of the alleged 'inefficiency' of Kerala's industrial system in terms of labour militancy, high wage-cost, and low productivity. The aim is to provide an overview of locational cost advantage/disadvantage of Kerala by analysing some facets of its industrial structure as compared to that of some developed states and the nation as a whole.||K.

It has, however, acquired a new connotation since the advent of the present Prime Minister. More than ever before, the accent today is on technological upgradation, production of high quality goods at lower prices with the help of appropriate imports, drastic reduction in direct taxes, rationalisation of indirect taxes, and the creation of a healthy competitive environment in various sectors of the economy. It is also believed that the economy will respond positively to these measures, alleviating at the same stroke rural poverty and unemployment. This paper seeks to focus attention on some aspects of this policy. It takes issue in particular with the Hussain Committee Report of 1984 which constitutes a cornerstone of the new economic regime.||Nirmal Kumar Chandra

Against this background it is useful to raise questions such as: How far are computers really likely to speed up the industrial growth of our country? What pattern of growth are they likely to promote? What are the likely costs of such growth in terms of our technological and economic independence and self-reliance? What is their likely impact on employment? Will economic, social and political disparities be reduced or aggravated by widespread use of computers?||Bagaram Tulpule

The Plan document gives the latest estimates in regard to the financing of the Sixth Plan and sets out a specific scheme for the financing of the Seventh. The LTFP provides a historical review of budgetary trends, identifies the major issues that have emerged, and projects the pattern of Plan and non-Plan financing for 1985-90. The Plan and the LTFP outline the desirable directions in which fiscal policy ought to evolve. We thus have a quantitative and qualitative framework with reference to which the first two budgets of the present government can be assessed. There is, however, already a significant slippage with reference to the projections in the Plan and the LTFP. The problem is not lack of policy but lack of success or seriousness in tackling the political and administrative obstacles in its implementation.||S. Guhan

While the focus of the paper is on the trade and production disruptions and consequent market distortions, it also looks at the macro-economic repercussions of the conflict, such as those arising from Sri Lanka's foreign exchange constraints.||Paul Seabright

The Seventh Five-Year Plan aims at raising it to 14 mmts by 1989-90. The task of accelerating growth in fertiliser consumption extends beyond the Seventh Plan period because, according to the author, virtually all further growth in crop production will have to come from continuous increases in yields and all proven yield-increasing technologies depend on high levels of fertiliser application. Thus, the author argues, the real question concerning the future is not whether but how to accelerate growth in fertiliser use and ensure its maximum effectiveness in crop production. This paper discusses the above question by examining the past experience within a heuristic framework. The framework identifies all variables behind economic potential and farmers' profitability of fertiliser use. More importantly, it also incorporates interactions between processes which influence the pace and pattern of growth in actual fertiliser consumption through conversion of the potential into farmers' effective demand for fertilisers, timely delivery of fertilisers at geographically dispersed locations, and creation of adequate aggregate supply of fertilisers. The single most important conclusion of the paper is as follows: Because of the constraints on towering prices of fertilisers and also on raising support prices of crops, non-price policies will be more crucial than ever before in determining the pace of future growth in fertiliser consumption. This, however, is no ground for pessimism about acceleration in future growth of fertiliser consumption or defeatist attitude in evolving policies required for the purpose. Under the present price environment, there is a vast scope to accelerate growth in fertiliser consumption through non-price policies which improve efficiency of fertiliser use, shift response functions upwards, and remove deficiencies in agricultural research, extension, and credit as well as fertiliser supply and distribution systems.||Gunvant M.

The writings of Arghiri Emmanuel or Samir Amin do contain many useful insights that serious students of economic developments can hardly afford to miss. Their main fault lies, however, in constructing a simplistic theory with an extremely small number of variables and quantifying them in a manner that suits the theory rather than the facts; they hardly realise that the variables properly estimated could often stand the theory on its head.||Nirmal Kumar Chandra

These requirements led to the imposition of a particular mode of control and authority over its labouring population which in its turn imparted to the latter some qualitative characteristics which differentiated them from other segments of the wage earning labour force. This article examines the historical process of evolution of plantation labour system in parts of Assam. The first three sections deal with the transfer of sectors of the population from a variety of non-capitalist economies to the command of capital; the labour process in the plantations and the nature and maintenance of authority in the plantation areas. The later sections address the process of production and reproduction of labour power and the nature and extent of proletarianisation. The author also touches upon the larger theoretical implications of the empirical data presented, such as the symbiotic relationship between the deliberately created subsistence economies and the capitalist sector.||Ranajit Das Gupta

29/11/1986- ||review of management, november 1986||4376385||Bureaucracy and Development||The theory of bureaucracy suffers from contradictions and has reached an impasse. Weber's contribution lies, not in discovering the characteristics of bureaucracy, since these were mentioned by Kautilya and Hegel before him, but in legitimising it, in the face of Marx's criticism, on the ground of its rationality, indicated chiefly by its use of specialised knowledge. However, he confuses between specialisation of function and specialisation of knowledge, and fails to realise the significance of the fact that generalist administrators are given higher status and emoluments than specialists. He also tries to ignore the fact that bureaucratisation involves exploitation and alienation, which interfere with the utilisation and growth of science and technology. In contemporary India, the socialisation of administrators in the family, the university and the organisation tends to make them psychopathic. The public bureaucracy provides support to the ruling class, politically as well as economically: its expansion helps to create effective demand for durable consumer goods produced by the monopoly and oligopoly sector. The bureaucratisation of education results in universities which are hollow shells, without the kernel of scholarship. They only help to maintain and legitimise the existing order, not to induce change. Industrial organisations also do not support research and development; they deepen national dependency. Bureaucratisation mainly fulfils private interests through the exploitation of the vast majority.||Satya Deva

Hindu chauvinism and the theo-political orientation of the Akali Dal have unwittingly but inexorably acted in tandem to thwart the emergence of a composite Punjabi identity. Had the Punjabi genius been able to fashion a viable synthesis across the communal divide, the state would have been spared its most recent trauma, the country's federal system would have had one hurdle less to cross in propelling the none-too-easy enterprise of nation-building, the Akalis would not have had to make do with a pyrrhic victory in the creation of truncated Punjabi Suba and the national leadership of the ruling party would not have been able to draw the boundaries of the new state on communal rather than linguistic lines.||K.

This study empirically examines what agricultural impact electricity and other infrastructure improvements have had on 108 villages in three states. The conclusion is that rural electrification has had a direct impact on agricultural productivity through private investment in electric pumps. However, farmers also have made substantial investments in diesel pumps, although at a somewhat slower rate. Also, for villages first receiving electricity there is a substitution of electric pumps for diesel ones. Although rural electrification has had a significant impact on agriculture, there has been no explosive growth as was anticipated by many of the early planners.||Douglas F. Barnes,Hans P. Binswanger

It has seen that despite substantial tax reliefs, the industrial production index has risen only 6.4 per cent in 1985, a rate substantially lower than the 8 per cent growth on which the Seventh Plan estimates are based. The government has also realised that the opening of the doors to imports of machinery and industrial ancillaries has led not only to an intractable balance of payments crisis but also a considerable damage to indigenous producers of such machinery. These producers have been led up the garden path by the theology of import substitution, and they include a large number of public sector enterprises. On the Plan side, the government has shown some recognition of the fact that, in the Indian situation, poverty cannot be alleviated by depending on market forces and expecting the benefits of increased production to trickle down to the poor automatically. From the fact that certain lessons seem to have been learnt, one has some grounds for expecting a wind of change. But such a wind-actually very low-can be easily turned in a wrong direction by faulty policies. If there is any change in the new budget compared to the high winds of last year, it is that the budget is reverting to its type. The type-change that is required is that which gives economic justice top priority and defines all growth in terms of increases in the output of essential mass consumption goods.||Bhabatosh Datta

Macro famines, such as those confined to a district or a village or affecting populations practising a single craft or occupation, etc, have received far less attention. Raymond Firth's work on famine in Tikopia, a Polynesian island with a small population is important because apart from brief examinations of 'hunger periods' by Malinowski and Richards, there have been hardly any investigations of such situations by anthropologists. This paper evaluates Firth's study on famine, its nature and causes and also tests his explanation for famine against his own postulates on the economic basis of society.||Amrita Rangasami

We analyse one important determinant of farmers' participation-the potential for crop insurance to reduce household income variability. Based on simulated crop insurance designs carried out on household panel data, we find that crop insurance is not effective in smoothing fluctuations in income. The simulation results point to some general conditions that have to be satisfied if crop insurance is to generate measurable risk benefits. We argue that those conditions are unlikely to be met in India's Semi-Arid Tropics. What defeats crop insurance in dryland agriculture is area variability which is largely attributed to households responding to rainfall events. Because crop insurance scores such low marks as an effective stabilisation policy, rainfall lotteries and rural public works are also evaluated. Both of these institutional alternatives could be or are superior to crop insurance as a means to reduce income variability for large numbers of rural households in India's Semi-Arid Tropics.||T. S.

25/10/1986- ||review of women studies, october 1986||4376265||Research on Women and Career: Issues of Methodology||Until the seventies university research on women was almost exclusively focused on the educated employed women. Subsequently while research on poor women became more innovative, highlighting class and gender linkages, studies on educated women were relatively sterile yielding little by way of either new methodology or insight. A major reason for this lies in the uncritical imitation of the Western theoretical model of sex roles and role conflicts. This paper reviews studies of employed women in the light of two approaches, role analysis and career motivation. Sex role theory, the author notes, bypasses the complexity of gender relations and its historical evolution. The 'dual role' approach fragments the world of work from the domestic scene in a stark contrast, depicts them as discrete spheres at war with each other. The linkages between the two and the mutual reinforcements have thus not been examined or even perceived.||Maithreyi Krishna Raj

While the reversal of the policy in these respects is no doubt welcome, the thrust of the fiscal measures is still far away from the central objective of higher production with more equitable distribution. In examining the Budget proposals we need to keep this fundamental objective in constant view, but of more immediate interest to us is the extent to which the Finance Minister addresses himself to the pressing problems of raising resources for the Plan without fuelling inflation, of disequillibrium in the balance of payments and of the sharp rise in the number of job-seekers-solution to which problems will go a long way towards the attainment of the central objective of growth with equity.||Mihir Rakshit

It is to cater to the needs of this class that the modern system of education developed in 19th century Bengal. Modern Bengali language developed during this period as the language of bhadraloks and modern language textbooks emerged as a corollary to the new system of education and reflected the cultural world of the bhadraloks. In the process indigent people, who had earlier participated in the indigenous vernacular system, were left out of the elementary system that took its place. Education became exclusively a bhadralok affair. In fact, this new education system developed parallel to the destruction of the indigenous system of the ordinary people.||Poromesh Acharya

27/12/1986- ||special articles||4376504||Development Dialogue in the 1980s and Beyond||An important prerequisite to the resumption of the development dialogue is a much clearer understanding of the dynamics of the world economy. Any expectation that the world recovery in the eighties can be propelled by the worldwide operation of market forces without any modicum of planning is quite untenable. Economic models based on harmonious steady growth paths are largely irrelevant as possible outcomes of market processes. If balanced and relatively even development processes are at all desired objectives, they will need to be consciously planned for. Against this background, three issues are of major importance in the context of a development dialogue today: (a) a way out of the debt problem for the big debtors in a manner which combines issues of equity along with those of liquidity; (b) creation of significant amounts of SDRs recommended by many eminent economists who feel that the present international monetary regime is hindering the growth of developing countries; and (c) a change in the development model in developing countries which emphasises the need to step up foodgrains production and productivity along with creation of sufficient employment opportunities.||Sukhamoy Chakravarty

He may at times recommend obviously radical measures. But the characters he creates in his fiction-his craftmanship rested on creating characters that reflected the existing reality and at the same time also embodied the possibilities and directions of desired changes-rarely, if ever, agitate for the realisation of these measures. Except for the occasions when the call of the greater cause of nationalism necessitates a different mode of behaviour, his ideal women characters merge their identities with those of their men. In this merger alone-or through it-do they seek hope and salvation. They remain the hidden forces behind their men. Their success lies not in anything they do but in what they make possible for their men to achieve. They are the perpetual givers. The takers among them remain the counter-ideal. Ironically it is the latter who are equipped with the will and the determination to fight exploitation actively. But they are condemned for their supposed self-indulgence and shallowness.||Geetanjali Pandey

However, the three evaluations also differ significantly as a result of the various interests that impinge upon them as well as those interests that they represent.||Shanti George

Why has such a vast system of reverse discrimination been so relatively uncontroversial? The overwhelming reason is the ineffectiveness of the reservation for untouchables and tribals over almost 40 years of practice. Reservation has failed to alter the relative prosperity between high or middle castes and untouchables or tribals and has therefore not engendered the resentment that a more successful scheme would have. It is nevertheless still possible to perceive the system as having had useful marginal effects on mass poverty and also as having created a group within the scheduled castes and tribes which is either actually or potentially useful in leadership roles in these communities. It is the latter question-that of the emergence of a so-called 'Harijan elite'-which is the concern of this paper. The material for the discussion has been collected through interviews with representatives of one branch of the presumptive elite, occupants of reserved seats in Parliament and the state legislatures.||Oliver Mendelsohn

23/8/1986- ||special articles||4376042||Trade Strategies for Development||The best type of trading strategy depends in part on the general world environment. When world trade is growing fast and without substantial fluctuations, there are many advantages to a pro-trade strategy. However, if world output is more or less stagnant, alternative arrangements become much more attractive. There is a strong case for arguing that trade between rich and poor countries tends to perpetuate a particular pattern of technical dependence and technical change that is undesirable. However, trade restrictions by themselves do not prevent this from occurring. Many economies have followed restrictive policies, but combined them with heavy technological dependence, financial indebtedness, inappropriate patterns of technology, and extreme inequality. Trade restrictions only permit more appropriate patterns of development in a political context in which this type of development strategy is favoured. In the absence of such a political context, trade may well lead to a better situation in terms of employment opportunities, income distribution and independence than heavy restrictions. In general, trade should be the servant of development not its master: that is to say, the general strategy of development should be chosen first-including the desired technology choice, income distribution, mode of production, etc-and a trading strategy chosen which fits in with this, rather than the trading environment dictating the choice of development strategy. In practice, this requirement is often not realised; one reason, of course, is that trading patterns influence the political economy of a country and consequently the choices it makes.||Frances Stewart,Ejaz Ghani

This would involve the setting up of a number of nuclear establishments and would expose a number of people, workers and neighbouring communities to varying degrees of excess radiation. The Indian Rare Earths is the only DAE venture which has completed 30 years of operation, which incidentally is the average latency for cancer which is just one of the health hazards of exposure to radiation. This paper reports a retrospective epidemiological study of workers at the Rare Earths Division of the Indian Rare Earths Limited, Alwaye in Kerala. The study examines the mortality profiles of workers for the last 15 years. Workers at the nearby Travancore Cochin Chemicals and those insured with the Employees State Insurance Corporation are taken as the control populations. The study demonstrates a significant difference in the incidence of cancer and mortality due to heart diseases and all causes between the IRE workers and the control populations. The incidence of sterility among the IRE workers and genetic disorders among their children also appear to be high. However, a study of this sort can only formulate a clinical hypothesis. There is an urgent need to institute a comprehensive, inter-disciplinary study of the plant and the workers. Such a study cannot unfortunately be conducted by independent workers or research centres because the Atomic Energy Act of 1962 prohibits any such inquiry into the affairs, including health and safety issues, of the DAE.||V.

With a drastic fall in the growth of bank deposits, bank lending to the commercial sector and to the priority sectors in particular would dwindle and the capital market would cease to be a growing source of funds to the private sector. The Committee's recommendation to fix the discount on Treasure Bills on the basis of the expected short-term inflation rate and the interest rates of bank deposits and government bonds with reference to the expected long-term inflation rates would produce avoidable instability in the financial system when the values of the two inflation rates are widely divergent. The suggested interest rate mechanism, apart from lacking logical consistency in the area of fixation of short-term rates, also does not pay adequate attention to the phenomenon of 'money illusion' of the rural depositors and the unorganised money markets.||R.

This has been due to the loss of government momentum in the development facilities for engineering and medical education after 1966/67. Instead of planning for expansion in this field, state governments have, on the grounds of resource constraints, allowed the setting up of private colleges. The author contends that with the mushrooming of such colleges the link between education and personnel requirement is likely to be snapped. In the long-run these private institutions will pre-empt government efforts in the field of engineering and medical education to the detriment of all but a few.||V. N. Kothari

Not just the capitalists, but a multiplicity of ruling classes contend for the economic surplus. The standard paradigm of economic theory cannot recognise such a situation. Hence there is an urgent need for innovation in the methodology of analysis, and in the 'research programme' itself. Models of game theory and of genetic evolution may be applied to gain insight into the working of the system. The immediate task of economic policy should be to work towards the dissolution of the links which hold the dominant coalition together.||Ranjit Sau

The object of the extension is to review the recent debate on the issue, and the related questions that follow, in the light of Rubin's treatment of the subject. The author's focus is on the qualitative value problem; the quantitative aspects are peripheral to the main thrust of this paper. The paper is divided into three sections. Section II outlines the essentials of the Marxian concept of abstract labour as elaborated by Rubin. The limitations of Rubin's analysis are pointed out and possible modifications are examined. The implications of Rubin's analysis, in the context of the recent debate on value theory, have been worked out in section III.||Ajit Kumar Chaudhury

This paper examines the shifts in the sources of growth since the sixties from area increase to improvements in yields; growth in irrigation and in the use of modern inputs; and takes a brief look at the recent changes in the agriculture's terms of trade. Against this background the authors pose the complex question of the relationship between agricultural growth and the welfare of the rural masses and identify three major frontiers which need to be crossed to push agricultural growth beyond its present limits.||V.

The case study presented here discusses the major issues faced by the Committee and the government's reaction to its recommendations in terms of actual tariff proposals. The study concludes with an analysis of the reasons underlying the government's operational approach, and suggests some ways by which the cross pressures hindering the implementation of an integrated approach to rail tariffs might be better withstood.||H.

On the other side, in a period of global economic crisis and a retreat of progressive forces in many parts of the world capitalist order, there has been a resurgence of neoclassical doctrines. These doctrines have assumed their crudest form perhaps in the field of international economic policy prescriptions. Sraffa provided both a critique of neoclassical economics and a major foundationstone for a social science based on the idea that one of the central quaesita of such a science is the generation of a social surplus, the forces governing its distribution among contending classes or groups and changes in the nature of alignment and strength of these forces over time and the consequent changes in the distribution of the social surplus. The interpretation of classical political economy as the locus of theories of surplus value goes back at least to Marx and the tradition continued in the writings of later Marxists. The great merit of Sraffa's work was to breathe new life into what appeared to be a nearly moribund theoretical corpus as far as academic economics was concerned and indicate a way of measuring the social surplus, by specifying some basic parameters of distribution. Paul Baran had used the concept of potential surplus as a central idea in his pioneering work on the political economy of growth and underdevelopment only three years before the publication of Sraffa's book. The followers of Baran and the economic theorists following in the footsteps of Sraffa have, however, largely gone their different ways. Available evidence indicates that both Baran and Sraffa owed their basic vision to a broadly defined Marxist paradigm. What originated as two streams of the same broad vision of social change can be fruitfully combined to bring about an enriched, radical social science. The present paper is an effort in that direction.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

The consequences of this change vary according to the socio-economic class of the households and the gender of household members. The paper argues that the production and kinship systems in rural Bangladesh should be analysed in terms of class and gender. Women from the poorest class face special, often devastating risks associated with one particular manifestation of the traditional production system, the highly segregated labour and product markets. Moreover, an increasing number of women need access to the labour and product markets which to date, have been largely segregated for males.||Marty Chen
05/7/1986- ||special articles||4375858||Common Property Resources and Rural Poor in Dry Regions of India||Common property resources (CPRs), though neglected by policy makers and planners, play a significant role in the life of the rural poor. This paper, part of a larger study on the role of CPRs in farming systems of dry areas of India, attempts to quantify the extent to which the rural poor benefit from CPRs. Based on data from over 80 villages in 21 districts in dry regions of seven states, the study reveals significant contribution of CPRs towards the employment and income generation for the rural poor, i e, labour and small farm households. The per household per year income derived from CPRs ranged between Rs 530 and Rs 830 in different areas. This is higher than the income generated by a number of anti-poverty programmes in some areas. The dependence of richer households on CPRs is much less. Despite such contributions of CPRs, their area and productivity are declining in all the regions. The area of CPRs has declined by 26 to 63 per cent during last three decades. Large-scale privatisation of CPR has taken place mainly during the last three decades. The privatisation of CPRs was done largely to help the poor. However, 49-86 per cent of the privatised CPR ended up in the hands of the non-poor in different areas. Furthermore, most of the land received by the poor households was also given up by them as they did not have complementary resources to develop and use the newly received lands. Thus, the rural poor collectively lost a significant part of the source of their sustenance through the decline of CPRs. This loss does not seem to be compensated by privatised CPR lands given to (or retained by) them. The situation calls for greater attention to CPRs as a part of the anti-poverty strategy.||N. S.

Operation Flood has shown that the structural nature of rural poverty, with its widespread social consequences, would require technological and economic interventions through a closely integrated approach.

In their eagerness to see the economy take off, the Indian planners opted for the policy of the 'big push' in which the creation of a large number of varied public enterprises played a major role. However, the Indian economy failed to take off as expected, among other reasons, because of the 'drag-effect' caused by the inefficiency of these public enterprises. To realise their original goals, Indian planners will have to reorient their development strategies. They will have to move from a policy of 'big push' to a policy of 'big stick'. That is, from a policy that emphasises the creation of more public enterprises to one that emphasises better utilisation of existing public enterprises through performance evaluation. This paper suggests a way of doing the latter.||Prajapati Trivedi

It is a form which is rooted in the working class and lower middle class Goan Catholic population living in Goa or outside expressing their trials and tribulations, hopes and aspirations. The very fact that "Tiatr" is the most vibrantly alive and commercially successful theatrical entertainment of the Goans demands serious attention and inquiry into what makes it so. In order to understand "Tiatr" as an expression of popular culture, it is necessary to relate it to the historical processes which have shaped Goan Catholic society and Goan cultural ethos. Specifically for understanding a popular phenomenon such as "Tiatr", it is necessary to understand predominantly mobile, lower middle class ethos which has contributed so much to and in fact shaped "Tiatr." This study of "Tiatr" focuses on Goan society, its hierarchical structure, the lower middle class migration from Goa, the spatial and temporal factors contributing to the formation of Goan ethos and the Konkani movement, other cultural performances both indigenous and foreign which preceded and affected the development of "Tiatr". These provide the context within which "Tiatr" operates. This is followed by a 'textual' analysis of "Tiatr"-the performers, the audience and the message, the structure and organisation, plots and themes.||Pramod Kale

This argument has been demonstrated here by examining in detail the struggle of the Santhal "bataidars" (sharecroppers who were tenants-at-will) against their maliks (comprising tenure-holders and occupancy tenants) in Dhamdaha revenue circle in the western part of Purnea district between 1938 and 1942. The conflict occurred in a political environment dominanted partly by the national movement and partly by the struggles of the upper layers of the tenantry against the zamindars in Bihar. The capacity of the Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha and the Congress to take up the problems of tenants-at-will has been critically examined, and a point of view that endorses the latter's position giving primacy to the campaign against colonial rule, while postponing the solution of agrarian issues till the attainment of Independence, has been questioned. The conflict between the Santhal "bataidars" and their maliks has been examined in the context of the ecological setting in which the two groups came to be involved in a common scheme of production relations. It has been argued that the principal shortcoming of much of the work on agrarian struggles in Bihar during the period of British rule in the twentieth century is the failure to postulate a clear picture of agrarian differentiation based on the unique features of the pattern of production relations in the area of conflict. While emphasising the unique elements of class relations in Dhamdaha, including the capacity of the Santhal "bataidars" to pilot their own struggle, the limitations of regarding them as an autonomous group have been stressed.

It was one of the most successful experiments of its kind as well as the most daring and radical in its innovativeness. Its founder, Lala Devaraj an Arya Samajist and his supporters most of whom were women, faced criticism and attack from conservative opinion both inside and outside the Samaj. The battles they fought and the way the internal contradictions in the Arya Samaj theory and practice were resolved are significant because they are typical of the legacy inherited by women's education today from its nineteenth century beginnings.||Madhu Kishwar

International copyright is a key concern in Third World nations because they use knowledge from abroad and are generally dependent on foreign books. Historically these nations mainly inherited the European approach to copyright since most of the copyright laws were patterned on the colonial regulations which were in place at the time of independence-they have moved slowly to indigenise their copyright laws. Although the United States in the ninetheenth century and the Soviet Union in the mid-twentieth century flouted copyright while they built their own national publishing industries, today, all the world's major publishing nations, except the People's Republic of China are part of the international copyright system. There is a consensus, regardless of political ideology economic organisation or position in the knowledge hierarchy that anarchy in knowledge creation and distribution is to be avoided. However copyright with few exceptions, protects the "haves". It is a form of monopoly that gives basic control over knowledge to the creator of that knowledge.||Philip G. Altbach

In practice the major impact of such provisions is not to increase production through incentives to workers, but rather to enable management to rationalise reductions in work force in order to reduce the man-machine ratio. Unlike in Tamil Nadu where labour productivity in the cotton textile industry is rising, in Delhi it is decisively declining. This means that if present trends continue and wages are linked to productivity, real wages may be expected to decline in Delhi. This is only a part of the broader dilemmas faced by a dying industry.||Sharat G. Lin

This is not to plead for a restoration of the earlier economic regime whose contradictions have paved the way for 'liberalisation' in the first place. Rather, these contradictions have to be overcome, but in a manner completely different from, and opposed to, what the World Bank and other agencies have been advocating. Not only must the orientation of economic policy change visibly in favour of the working people, but the implementation of policy must itself be based upon the active participation of the working people. Such a change would also have the effect of raising the working people above their preoccupation with economism and narrow sectional interests.||Prabhat Patnaik

26/4/1986- ||special articles||4375605||Underutilisation Revisited: Surface Irrigation in Drought Prone Areas of Western Maharashtra||This paper examines irrigation potential and its utilisation in respect of the Mula irrigation system in Western Maharashtra. The empirical evidence gathered for the Mula project indicates concentration of a heavy-water-using crop like sugarcane in the head reaches of the canal. Correspondingly, the utilisation percentage is higher in the head reaches of the canal than in the tail reaches. This kind of development adversely affects the availability of water to the tail-enders. Another adverse impact of this type of irrigation development is waterlogging and soil salinity, mainly in the upper reaches of the canal. Official statistics of the Ahmednagar Irrigation Circle show that a significant proportion of the irrigable command area of the Mula project is not available for irrigation because of waterlogging, salinity and alkalinity. The findings of the study also suggest that the percentage of area irrigated to the potential created does not give a correct measure of the extent of utilisation of irrigation potential. The definition of irrigation potential created assumes that land development (levelling, construction of field channels, etc) below the outlet head is complete and that the 'chak' is ready to receive the irrigation water, whereas in actual practice this may not be the case. Second, as noticed in the Mula project, the cropping pattern that actually develops may be considerably different from that assumed while ascertaining the potential created. In view of these factors, the author suggests, it would be more meaningful to estimate the extent of utilisation by taking into account the water released compared to the planned release and the area actually irrigated.||Ashok K.
