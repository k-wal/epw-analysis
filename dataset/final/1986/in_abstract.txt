The persistence of the problems of these sections is an outcome of the failure of the Indian National Congress to effectively integrate agrarian issues with its programme for attaining Independence. This argument has been demonstrated here by examining in detail the struggle of the Santhal "bataidars" (sharecroppers who were tenants-at-will) against their maliks (comprising tenure-holders and occupancy tenants) in Dhamdaha revenue circle in the western part of Purnea district between 1938 and 1942. The conflict occurred in a political environment dominanted partly by the national movement and partly by the struggles of the upper layers of the tenantry against the zamindars in Bihar. The capacity of the Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha and the Congress to take up the problems of tenants-at-will has been critically examined, and a point of view that endorses the latter's position giving primacy to the campaign against colonial rule, while postponing the solution of agrarian issues till the attainment of Independence, has been questioned. The conflict between the Santhal "bataidars" and their maliks has been examined in the context of the ecological setting in which the two groups came to be involved in a common scheme of production relations. It has been argued that the principal shortcoming of much of the work on agrarian struggles in Bihar during the period of British rule in the twentieth century is the failure to postulate a clear picture of agrarian differentiation based on the unique features of the pattern of production relations in the area of conflict. While emphasising the unique elements of class relations in Dhamdaha, including the capacity of the Santhal "bataidars" to pilot their own struggle, the limitations of regarding them as an autonomous group have been stressed.||Anand Chakravarti
22/2/1986- ||special articles||4375369||Urbanisation in India: Review and Prospects||Developing strategies for management of rapid urban growth constitutes a major challenge for development-planners and policy-makers. The strategies must satisfy two essential conditions. First, they must contribute to meeting the needs for gainful employment, housing, and essential services of the rapidly increasing urban population at acceptable economic and social cost. Second, they must ensure that urban growth contributes to national and regional economic growth, particularly through multiple, growth-inducing urban-rural interactions. The strategies will require advances in several directions, but principally in developing (a) a spatial pattern of urbanisation that is better adapted to the economic and social conditions of India than the one which has been allowed to develop during the last several decades; (b) lower-cost technologies of construction and of delivery of urban services; and (c) suitable political and administrative structures for management of large urban systems. This paper is divided into six parts. In part I, trends in the growth of the urban population during the 30-year period 1951-81 and the projections of the growth to the end of the century, contained in the World Development Report 1984, are reviewed. Part II discusses the strategies of dispersed industrial development and urbanisation which have formed the basis of official policies since the early 1960s. Part III discusses the issue of resources of finance and management for urban administration and for undertaking the needed programme of expansion of housing and urban services. The reasons for grossly inadequate resource-allocation during the last three decades and the prospect of more adequate resource inputs in future are discussed. Part IV and V are devoted to discussion of the problems of the maintenance of peace and security and of environmental pollution in the cities. The problems of the four giant cities-Bombay, Calcutta, Madras and Delhi-are discussed very briefly in Part VI against the background of projections of increase in their populations by two or three times during the 20-year period, 1980-2000, made by the authors of the World Development Report 1984. The question is raised whether it will be possible to cope with the pressures created by such rapid growth on urban systems which are already so greatly over-strained.||V. Nath

Review of National Goitre Control Programme||More than 120 million people in India are exposed to the risk of endemic goitre which has long been established as being a consequence of environmental iodine deficiency. Iodine prophylaxis through the widespread use of iodised salt is the accepted and financially feasible method of preventing and controlling endemic goitre. The National Goitre Control Programme (NGCP) is now two decades old. Yet, less than 15 per cent of the known endemic areas are being covered under the programme. Why has the NGCP failed? This article critically reviews the programme.||C. S. Pandav,N. Kochupillai,M. G. Karmarkar,L. M. Nath

Not only has this resulted in a decline in soil fertility and productivity, but it has had a deleterious effect on cardamom cultivation as well. This paper reviews the social, economic and political processes which have operated in the region before and after Independence. Under British the policy followed by the government was compatible with the interests of the cardamom cultivators. Improvements in productivity could be achieved without disturbing the ecological balance. During the post-Independence period encroachment of forest land and the policy of regularising these encroachments has led to indiscriminate denudation.||P. Sivanandan,D. Narayana,K. Narayanan Nair

Some Results from a South Indian Farm Economy Study||The controversy over 'farm size and productivity' which began more than two decades ago is continuing unabated. It has important implications for the debate on agricultural development. The following case study of agricultural production in Tiruchi district, Tamil Nadu, is intended in part as a contribution to this discussion. It is the authors' argument that the size-productivity framework may not be the most fruitful one for analysing the problem of agricultural productivity. Besides the fact that size is not necessarily the best measure of scale, their material brings out the point that scale may not always be relevant to the determination of productivity. The evidence that the authors examine suggests that intensity of cultivation and the class status of cultivating households may be more important in this regard. A methodological conclusion arising from the study is that since the ecological and historical specificities of a farm economy play an important role in the determination of productivity, it would be most hazardous to make generalisations regarding the size-productivity relationship.||Venkatesh B.

The utility of such an organisation is evidenced in the findings of the scholars all over the world. Despite various government pronouncements about the necessity of farmers' organisation, they are in a state of infancy in India. The relevant issues concerning farmers' organisation which are required to be resolved before such organisations are built in to the irrigation projects are as follows: 1) The Role of the Government/the Agency 2) Farmers' participation: before or after OFD Works 3) Single versus multi functions 4) One tier versus multi tier 5) Village based versus channel based 6) Lesions from indigenous systems. The paper outlines the factors contributing to the success of such an organisation. The factors deduced from a successful case of farmers' organisation studied by us earlier are: i) Good leadership; ii) Adequate and reliable water supply; iii) Greater interaction between the officials and the farmers; iv) Easy unanimity among group members; v) Inducement from the government/the agency; and vi) Legitimacy of the organisation.||Niranjan Pant

In the meantime, the number of senior administrators in most developing countries needing intervention inputs for development has been steadily increasing with the growth in the pace of planned economic development. The environmental context of job performance by the senior administrator has also been changing along with sharp adjustments in the configuration of internal and external relationships in the growing maze of government departments. It is therefore necessary to appreciate the contemporary context as well in establishing the case for development of senior administrators, so that some prevailing concerns can be identified and pursued for implementation This paper seeks to isolate some challenges constituting the context, the range of needed intervention inputs and related issues as the underpinnings.||A.

Or, can a case be made that perhaps social forestry objectives should be modified somewhat and that with a changed set of goals there is ample scope for a flow of benefits to the rural poor? Such questions are especially pertinent at present, given the government's programme for massive afforestation of degraded lands and the release in October 1985 of a World Bank-sponsored study calling for a five-year, $ 500 million, fuelwood-agro-forestry effort in India. This paper addresses these issues, both at the national level and with special reference to Maharashtra, which has a major social forestry enterprise currently under way.||Harry W. Blair

However, since partisan science is cognitively rooted in special vested interests, it tends to bias public policy decisions in their favour and against public interest. In support of this argument, the authors review the role of public interest science in environmental action in the Doon Valley and in the forest struggles.||Vandana Shiva,J. Bandyopadhyay

26/4/1986- ||special articles||4375605||Underutilisation Revisited: Surface Irrigation in Drought Prone Areas of Western Maharashtra||This paper examines irrigation potential and its utilisation in respect of the Mula irrigation system in Western Maharashtra. The empirical evidence gathered for the Mula project indicates concentration of a heavy-water-using crop like sugarcane in the head reaches of the canal. Correspondingly, the utilisation percentage is higher in the head reaches of the canal than in the tail reaches. This kind of development adversely affects the availability of water to the tail-enders. Another adverse impact of this type of irrigation development is waterlogging and soil salinity, mainly in the upper reaches of the canal. Official statistics of the Ahmednagar Irrigation Circle show that a significant proportion of the irrigable command area of the Mula project is not available for irrigation because of waterlogging, salinity and alkalinity. The findings of the study also suggest that the percentage of area irrigated to the potential created does not give a correct measure of the extent of utilisation of irrigation potential. The definition of irrigation potential created assumes that land development (levelling, construction of field channels, etc) below the outlet head is complete and that the 'chak' is ready to receive the irrigation water, whereas in actual practice this may not be the case. Second, as noticed in the Mula project, the cropping pattern that actually develops may be considerably different from that assumed while ascertaining the potential created. In view of these factors, the author suggests, it would be more meaningful to estimate the extent of utilisation by taking into account the water released compared to the planned release and the area actually irrigated.||Ashok K.
