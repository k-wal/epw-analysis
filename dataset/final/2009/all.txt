In this sense, the political choices made at the state level are mostly "principal" and those made at the national level are increasingly "derivative". But state level politics shapes and filters rather than pre-determines the national outcome. Using this framework and the trends in 2004-09, this study attempts to understand the structure of contestation that will shape the final outcome in the coming Lok Sabha elections. The complex pattern of principal outcomes and timing in the political calendar shows that neither of the two major national alliances can sweep the polls nor be swept away in the 2009 Lok Sabha elections. In all probability, we are going to witness one more election in which no single party or pre-poll alliance is likely to get a clear majority and one where the smallest of changes in individual states is likely to have a major impact on government formation in New Delhi.||Yogendra Yadav,Suhas Palshikar

The separatists also need to learn from their tactical mistakes and not take the people for granted. Having demonstrated their strength through large-scale nonviolent protests in July-August 2008, demanding azaadi, the people have now exercised their vote peacefully. This represents a shift in equations away from armed militancy and towards a strong but peaceful demand for independence.||Gautam Navlakha

This commentary argues that there has been next to no public debate on the ethical, social and medical questions around infertility and surrogacy in our context, and makes a beginning in this direction. Thanks to pressure from women's groups the draft has now been placed on the web site of the Indian Council of Medical Research for comments.||Imrana Qadeer,Mary E. John

It tries to understand why the support system extended by the State has ended as being perceived as a "curse" rather than as "care". Their experience with the social support extended to them by the welfare state especially in housing is not congenial to their emotional system. The most useful form of support is one which is mediated and internalised within a peoples' existing social support systems. The paper argues for a more responsible and responsive approach from the welfare state.||SEETHA KAKKOTH

The turning point was the decision in September 2008 to let Lehman Brothers fail, an event that had a series of ruinous cascading effects. Given the depth of the crisis in the United States and Europe, it was only to be expected that India too would be affected. But India's well- regulated banking system and adequate policy responses should ensure that the fallout, at least on the banking sector, will be contained.||T. T. Ram Mohan
31/10/2009-6/11/2009||review of women's studies||25663734||Conjugality, Property, Morality and Maintenance||Indian matrimonial statutes do not provide for division of property upon divorce and for most women the right to maintenance forms the central core of their matrimonial dispute. During legal contests the focus is on the husband's "obligation" and the wife's "need" but situated within the patriarchal order, the right to maintenance is pitted against issues of sexuality and "sexual purity". The right also comes into conflict within the mandate of a monogamous marriage under the Hindu Marriage Act. Even if the theory of property distribution based on the model of equality is accepted, women's needs and dependence will not cease since marriage in India continues to be an unequal partnership with gendered roles. Therefore, though maintenance signifies dependency and reduces the wife to a subordinate position, divorced women are justified in claiming it.||FLAVIA AGNES

Where does India stand in this respect? Some of these important factors are discussed here. For instance, mutual funds are meant for the individual investor and they have tax benefits — yet corporates and banks invest in them. Another important factor is the multiplicity of transactions in the financial sector raising the possibility of excessive financialisation. Yet another question must be asked about commercial bank lending to profit-seeking microfinance institutions. And with limited lending to the real sector there seems to be a hollowness emerging in commercial bank services in India.||Y V REDDY

It shows how high road employment practices can exist only if conditions of competition are violated. It also argues that it is the control over value that determines the choice of the social mode of production and not the other way round. While arguing that it is not value chains but value cycles that generate different social modes of production relations, the paper tries to establish the existence of a global cost chain, which ultimately is borne by the most insecure and vulnerable social groups caught in an irresistible structural transition.||G.

However, with many developed countries pursuing aggressive policies for encouraging the production and use of biofuels, there are strong apprehensions that as more and more land is brought under biofuel crops, food prices would increase substantially affecting poor consumers, particularly those from low-income net food importing countries. Keeping in view these facts, this paper presents a brief overview of the current state of affairs of biofuels at the global level, with a special emphasis on the ongoing efforts of biofuel expansion in India. It throws light on the various policies at the national and regional levels and also on the implications of biofuels for changes in land utilisation, food security, social welfare and the environment.||S S RAJU,P SHINOJ,P K JOSHI

Although regional disparity may increase temporarily, the causality test provides support to the hypothesis about spread effects. The regional growth targets assigned by the Eleventh Plan in India seem to rely on the spread effects of economic growth acceleration in the better-off states to achieve its 9% growth target and reduce regional disparity in the long run. To strengthen the spread effects, the domestic economy should be further integrated and interlinked with free flow of goods, services and factors of production.||RAVINDRA H DHOLAKIA

It also suggests that the gender advantage the Congress enjoys at the all-India level does not indicate a consistent and decisive support by women for the party or its policies. All this is not very surprising given that the poll campaign ran with no focus on women's issues and little effort was made by anyone to politically mobilise women voters.||RAJESHWARI DESHPANDE

Specifically it deals with the cultural construct of "Kerala ayurveda", and the modes of its societal reproduction and recreation simultaneously as culture and as medicine in cosmopolitan Mumbai. Through an analysis of the historical and cultural roots of Kerala ayurveda and the role of community organisations in its translocation into a city, the paper shows the analytical fragility of the tradition/modern binary in the understanding of contemporary indigenous systems and questions the belief that state and market provide the foremost sites for institutional and secular practice of indigenous medicines.||Leena Abraham

However, until today, the Pakistani government has not apologised for its crimes against humanity and there are a small number of people in Bangladesh who do not consider the crackdown on 25 March 1971 a wrongful act. It seems that some people of the country are still not sure about how to characterise the liberation war of Bangladesh. This article distinguishes and separates the meanings of two behavioural actions – a political action and a moral action. These two types of actions have been examined here in terms of Bangladesh's socio-political history.||Mokerrom Hossain

As elsewhere in the world, the main uranium deposits are located on lands belonging to indigenous or tribal peoples. This paper discusses the unfolding controversy relating to uranium mining in the West Khasi Hills of Meghalaya. The government-owned Uranium Corporation of India has for long been trying to get access to the deposits of uranium, but has failed due to local opposition. During the past two years the government has stepped up its efforts to allow mining in Meghalaya and seeks to win over local people with promises of development. Although a reasonable proposition for some, there is also a strong opposition to this, usually citing either health reasons or issues having to do with ethnic sovereignty and indigenous rights. Allowing uranium mining, it is argued, would lead to the loss of indigenous lands and open the region to a large-scale influx of non-tribal people.||BENGT G KARLSSON

In the face of heightened concerns about rapid climate change, that argument is increasingly losing force — both in the fundamental arithmetic of climate change, and in the political reality that important western partners will increasingly demand more of India and other developing countries. The Indian government has outlined a broad plan for what could be done, but the plan still lacks a strategy to inform which efforts offer the most leverage on warming emissions and which are most credible. This paper offers a framework for that strategy. It suggests that a large number of options to control warming gases are in India's own self-interest, and with three case studies it suggests that leverage on emissions could amount to several hundred million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually over the next decade and an even larger quantity by 2030.||VARUN RAI,DAVID G VICTOR

Accordingly, the tax liability has been fixed on employers, and not on the employees. FBT collection data for first two years (2005-06 and 2006-07) have been analysed to gain a deeper insight for fine-tuning. Some statistical tests have been conducted. The test of equality of two proportions for a large sample shows that the proportion of FBT collection under different heads has remained the same over the two years. The chi-square test for equality of proportion shows that this proportion has remained the same for most sectors. However, the chi-square test for homogeneity of sample data for each sector and each head indicates that sample data are not homogeneous. It points towards arbitrary booking of expenses under different heads, perhaps to avoid FBT.||Praveen Kishore

Considering the fact that the ayurvedic medicinal ingredients are sourced differently, namely, from herbal, metal and mineral substances that cannot be industrially manufactured, the second question is: what are the challenges faced by the ayurvedic medicine manufacturing sector? The paper also throws light on the economic relevance of ayurvedic knowledge and how modern firms have amassed it in a competitive environment.||M. S. Harilal

This paper, based on fieldwork in six states in 2008, examines the socio-economic consequences of the NREGA for women workers. In spite of the drawbacks in the implementation of the legislation, significant benefits have already started accruing to women through better access to local employment, at minimum wages, with relatively decent and safe work conditions. The paper also discusses barriers to women's participation.||REETIKA KHERA,NANDINI NAYAK

Some Disquieting Features||India is variously described as a knowledge-based economy in the making, thanks essentially due to her high economic growth and the role played by knowledge-intensive sectors such as information technology in spurring and maintaining this growth performance. This paper looks at the empirical evidence on whether this is indeed the case since the reform process began in 1991. A variety of conventional indicators are analysed and their movements over the last two decades or so are charted to draw some firm conclusions. The results show that instances of innovation are restricted to a few areas such as the pharmaceutical industry. Further, increasingly most of the innovations in industry are contributed by foreign firms operating in the country.||SUNIL MANI

If so, how do we understand the experience of many oppressed groups who have found this democracy enabling in many ways? A possible way out of this endless debate is to see democracy not as a fully-formed end product of liberal-constitutionalism but as its untamed other — the mass politics which escapes and exceeds the Law and the injustices of Order. It is from here that the greatest challenges to capitalism and the State arise. The Maoist strategy, by merely trying to mimic the State, is actually inimical to this democratic upsurge and therefore needs to be resisted.||ADITYA NIGAM

This paper argues that even if we were to accept this position, the direction and structure of expenditures since the passage of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act has been far from "responsible" even when macro caps were being met. The structure of expenditure allocations in the 2009-10 budget appears to be inadequate for a "fiscal stimulus". The time is thus opportune to chalk out a set of "Second Generation Fiscal Rules", which will address the inadequacies that have surfaced during the four-year experience with fiscal rules at the central government level. Prioritising these second generation rules — thus following the gradualist approach — and strengthening enforcement via greater power to the Comptroller and Auditor General, which could play the role of a Fiscal Council, would facilitate greater success of the new rules.||MALA LALVANI

An analysis of future emissions of CO₂ in Annex I countries, large developing nations and other nations is done using a GAMS-based emission model. This analysis underlines sharply the historical responsibility of the developed nations for global warming and their duty to cut emissions drastically to mitigate climate change. Also large developing nations like China and India also need to contribute strongly to mitigation. It is argued that this necessity makes evident that carbon offsets will act as "double burden" on developing nations, as also a major disincentive to innovation in critical migration technologies in the industrialised world. The analysis implies that India needs an alternative climate policy that recognises proactive action for climate change mitigation while ensuring that the developed nations do not pass on their burden to the global South, which would otherwise seriously restrict its development options in the process.||TEJAL KANITKAR,T JAYARAMAN,MARIO D'SOUZA,PRABIR PURKAYASTHA,D RAGHUNANDAN,RAJBANS TALWAR

Big changes there are, but in the wrong direction. Aiming to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality, the National Rural Health Mission's Janani Suraksha Yojana scheme presses expectant mothers to go for "institutional delivery" and avoid home births. The NRHM document also speaks of revitalising local health traditions. This means that the dais who have been part of the local health traditions should be incorporated into the government structure at the lowest end as has always been the case. This paper raises various questions related to maternity care governance for the benefit of local communities and looks at the possibilities of strengthening the services with serious inputs from dais.

This article traces the theoretical underpinnings of PPP under a neoliberal, market-driven and growth-oriented state. It describes the economic imperatives for public and private resource management and the case for PPP. It critically looks at the ramifications of this paradigm of economic growth and development, which has had limited success with certain projects, but has opened up issues relating to asymmetry of access, equity and efficiency and evidence of further marginalisation of the poor.||AMRITA DATTA

By ending discrimination against tradable agriculture, economic reforms were expected to improve the terms of trade in favour of agriculture and promote its growth. The paper also discusses the cropping pattern changes that have taken place in area allocation as well as in terms of value of output. The slowdown in the process of cropping pattern change means that most government efforts to diversify agriculture have failed to take off.||G S BHALLA,GURMAIL SINGH

Objections aside, the scale of the crisis portends that the need to inject more capital into the system will only grow. In addition, deregulation and the transition in banking from a structure that was based on "buy-and-hold" to one that relied on an "originate-and-sell" strategy almost certainly points to the need for a publicly owned banking system to ensure the proper functioning of the private sector.||C.

This paper discusses whether the capabilities approach provides any advantage in addressing questions of inequality that may be also mediated through such institutions. With the help of empirical data, the capabilities approach is used to identify "conversion factors'' that are not typically addressed in the utility approach. A comparison is made between knowledge generated through the use of traditional data sources to measure access and returns to education with the knowledge about the dynamics of capabilities formation generated through the use of a mixture of data within the capabilities approach. This has the potential to help public policy decisions to improve education design and outcomes for girls from disadvantaged sections.||Jeemol Unni

By institutionalising centralism and leaving democracy undefined, this organisational form has fostered authoritarian tendencies and undermined the growth of new ideas in the working class movement. This is seen in India where the engagement of the communist parties with democracy has remained ad hoc and untheorised. This article argues that democratic centralism has been an obstacle for the communist parties to be able to creatively respond to new situations and conditions.||JAVEED ALAM

This essay points out that the increased integration of the global market today brooks no further postponement of major reforms. The risk is that if sound, transparent and effective regulation is not built into the international financial architecture to foster open trade in goods and services, emerging markets would neither have the confidence for investment abroad, nor would they have the confidence to open their markets to higher volatility and contagion risks. This crisis therefore is likely to trigger considerable changes in the way we think about the behaviour of markets and the proper role of regulation and governments, particularly in crisis managementWhat is needed is a dynamic, evolutionary, interactive, and holistic understanding of how complex markets evolve and mutate.||Andrew Sheng

Drawing from research in Mubarakpur, Azamgarh, it highlights the various schisms within the Muslim identity. Telling the story of identity through the eyes of lower caste Muslims, the paper shows that caste, class and maslaki affiliations remain important markers of identity within Muslim society. The very notion of "Islamic identity" is itself a matter of fierce interpretative debate among the Muslims. Drawing on evidence from madrasas, the paper argues that the "other" within the madrasa is not a Hindu but a fellow Muslim from another maslak.||Arshad Alam

The impact of the drought of 2009 will therefore be less severe than the drought of 2002. Beyond the immediate response, we need to think long term. Instead of pumping money into dams and canals, Indian agriculture will be better off investing in "groundwater banking".

Rising temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, and an increased frequency of floods and droughts are likely to have serious effects on rural populations in the absence of policies that actively help these households adjust to their changing geography. Survey data from villages affected by the Kosi flood of 2008 is used to speculate on how households and governments are likely to respond to unexpected weather events. The flood in Bihar rendered much of the land in the area uncultivable and resulted in large-scale unemployment. The state, while effective in providing immediate relief to flood victims, has done little to help the rural population adapt to their changed geography.||E SOMANATHAN,ROHINI SOMANATHAN

As local availability of basic food items and other agro-raw materials form the basis of rural employment diversification by farmer as well as landless households, diversification towards high value commercial crops leading to squeezing of these supplies may destroy the very foundation of the rural non-farm economy that is engaged in petty production.||Saumya Chakrabarti,Anirban Kundu

However, changes in the coverage of the Annual Survey of Industries demand a fresh look at the issue over a longer period. This paper attempts such an analysis for 1981-82 to 2004-05. For the period as a whole as well as for two separate periods - the pre-and post-reform phases-the picture that emerges is one of "jobless growth", due to the combined effect of two trends that have cancelled each other out. One set of industries was characterised by employment-creating growth while another set by employment- displacing growth. Over this period, there has been acceleration in capital intensification at the expense of creating employment. A good part of the resultant increase in labour productivity was retained by the employers as the product wage did not increase in proportion to output growth. The workers as a class thus lost in terms of both additional employment and real wages in organised manufacturing sector.||K. P. Kannan,G. Raveendran

The media is largely ignorant or chooses to ignore the issue of defence spending. The view across the political spectrum and the strategic community is that any exercise to limit this spending amounts to compromising national security and is therefore not a viable consideration. Whilst it is true that development cannot take place in an insecure environment, defence expenditure in a developing country has a direct impact on the outlay on social spending. The "guns versus butter" argument is valid especially when the guns are not buying the security the country needs against asymmetrical threats from within and without.||PAVAN NAIR

However, airport authorities as well as private stakeholders (through international consortia) continue to invest in ever larger and more capital-intensive infrastruetures. Major uncertainties arise regarding these long-term Investments since traffic forecasts have a legaey of being grossly inaecurate. In contrastto such practice, both literature and empirical evidence suggest that airport development should be undertaken in incremental Steps, avoiding overcommitment of funds and being able to adapt to a changed environment, including altered pattems of competition. This paper highlights scenarios that characterise paths of airport development in India. A decision-tree analysis provides a helpful tool to identify those paths for airport development that will minimise uncertainty and prove more effective in fostering robust and efficient growth forthe Indian air traffic System as a whole.||Hans Huber

Using two counter examples to prove a general point about contemporary West Bengal's dominant political tendencies, it argues that the elaborate organisational structure of the (Left) party system, that once proved to be the ruling Left Front's political strength, has now turned out to be a part of its problems. The LF's electoral compulsions have come in the way of its original social mobilisational impulses anýd programmes. Only recently some signals of mass mobilisation politics have begun looming on the political horizon of the state. It would require a thorough reconfiguring of the relationship between political parties and society - a shift from a party-society to a dynamic and reciprocal link between party and society - in order to transform the existing nature of particularistic politics and build instead an encompassing participatory politics.||Manabi Majumdar

Even this was unacceptable to the elites who used the courts, the military and the monarchy to depose him and institute an anti-democratic constitution which protects their privileges. But now that Thaksin is gone, a grass roots movement of the poor is emerging to challenge the hold of the elites, the military and the monarchy over Thailand.||Giles Ji Ungpakorn

While the Malas embraced the party as the champion of social justice, the Madigas opposed it as the party of the Kapus. Rather than seeing the PRP in these binary and oppositional lenses, it is necessary to view the party as a new choice for dalits. A brief history of caste politics in Andhra Pradesh is also undertaken in this essay.||Sambaiah Gundimeda

However, this decision was taken without addressing the problems caused by mandatory rotation of reserved seats, which women have been drawing attention to and the impasse over the Women's Reservation Bill remains.

The Politics of Emergency Framing||Groups opposing climate change have been springing up in many countries, constituting a climate change movement. Several writers and movement leaders argue that climate change is an emergency that requires urgent action by governments to bring the problem under control. However, framing the issue as an emergency has several potential disadvantages. It may implicitly prioritise climate change over other important social issues. It can orient the movement towards government-led solutions rather than build popular support for long-term efforts. Finally, emergency framing may be counterproductive: it can disempower citizens because the problem seems too big, whereas providing practical opportunities for action is a better long-term approach.||PATRICK HODDER,BRIAN MARTIN

It is clear that total world emissions of greenhouse gases need to decrease sometime during the coming decade, and fall sharply thereafter, if we are to avoid disastrous and irreversible climate change. While industrialised countries generally emit much more per capita than developing countries, some of the latter have per capita emissions approaching the world average. This paper proposes that these advanced developing countries take on commitments to limit future emissions increase to improvements in the gross domestic product or, better yet, the Human Development Index, noting that some countries have achieved much more emission-efficient development than others. Recognising differences in the accuracy of greenhouse gas emissions accounting, we propose separate treatment for energy-related co₂ emissions, forestry, agriculture, and fluorinated gases.||GAUTAM DUTT

India appears set once again for yet another phase of rising stocks, mounting carrying costs, and a crisis of plenty. The volatile cycles of rising and falling stocks appear to be the result of poor government intervention, in particular, poor procurement policies. It is argued here that unidirectional revisions in the minimum support price create serious demand and supply imbalances and extreme volatility in buffer stock cycles.||Ramesh Chand

While YSR instituted many schemes to address the needs of the poor, this largesse was also designed to feed a network of supporters. YSR's rule marked a clear departure from the time-honoured "politics of accommodation" in the Congress: perhaps for the first time, a uniquely parochial Reddy regime was put in place throughout the state. Turning the new approach of the Congress in New Delhi to his advantage, YSR managed to marginalise opposition to his leadership and thus emerged as the most powerful Congress chief minister of Andhra Pradesh in recent times.||K SRINIVASULU

Until recently, it has generally been thought that there was a sharp rise in the level of child mortality in the country during the early 1990s as a result of the first Gulf war and the accompanying United Nations economic sanctions. The main basis for this view was a survey conducted in 1999. However, estimates of the level and trend in child mortality are now available from two additional surveys. Neither of the new sets of estimates show any sign of a sharp increase in child mortality in the early 1990s. Therefore it seems probable that, as was suggested by a report in 2005, the 1999 survey data were deliberately manipulated by the then government of Iraq.||Tim Dyson

Traditionally, the conservation discourse has focused on the face-off between elite conservation institutions and the marginalised social groups, with domestic tourists being overlooked. At best, the latter are looked upon by the scientific-administrative elite as frivolous picnickers. But this neglect of an everincreasing constituency is an opportunity lost to gain its support for conservation policies and practices.

Yet, this does not mean that the question of whether Australians are (still) racists is an invalid one. It is clear that this is still an issue that Australia has not yet completely dealt with. This essay also argues that the Australian identity has become partly construed in terms of the question of whether Australians are racists or not, something that builds on a past of Anglo-Saxon "white" nation building and a future which is strongly multicultural and Asia-oriented.||MICHIEL BAAS

A vote for the incumbent party depends on the well-being of the national economy as well as the individual household. Voting decisions are based on retrospective evaluations of the economic condition. Expectations of the economy in the future did not show a significant effect on voting decisions. While both national and personal considerations have an effect on voting, the latter seem to matter more to Indian voters than the former. An implication of these findings is that political parties cannot afford to be indifferent to the economic perceptions of voters.||K C SURI

With the adoption of market-driven and business-friendly public policy in India, new workplaces like shopping malls are playing a decisive part in crafting suitable workers and citizens, and in reshaping individual subjectivity, consonant with the needs of the market and of neoliberal govemmentality for self-governing citizens and self-driven, pliant workers. The paper shows how young workers seek personal solutions to structurally or systemically generated problems in the economy and at the workplace; emphasise the responsibility, autonomy and agency of the self-driven, enterprising individual; disavow formal party politics and political engagementnegate the significance of the state in public policy; and allow both the government and employers to abdicate any responsibility for workers' and citizens' well-being.||Nandini Gooptu

The restructuring of the state-owned enterprises must begin at the top with a complete reorientation of the corporate governance mechanism which establishes the relationship between the government and the enterprise. With the growth of private operators in these sectors the state-owned enterprises are no longer of strategic importance to the government for sector development or providing "universal service". To the extent privatisation is not feasible or desirable at least in the short run, the corporate governance mechanism should be designed around the objective of growth and efficiency as in the case of private enterprises.||SIDHARTH SINHA

Outpatient and hospitalisation care in India in the past 20 years has declined drastically, leading to the emergence of private care players in a predominant way. While healthcare costs have shot up manifold in private provisioning, government health facilities are increasingly compelling patients to look for private outlets for procuring drugs and diagnostics. Due to these developments, millions of households are incurring catastrophic payments and are being pushed below poverty lines every year.||SAKTHIVEL SELVARAJ,ANUP K KARAN

They prefer targets based on reductions in total emissions by developing countries, comparable or equivalent to those undertaken by them. This paper offers a new approach that tries to bolster the case for a per capita emissions approach by distinguishing the CO₂ emissions intensity of production and consumption from energy use per capita. It also outlines some projections that could lead to a reasonable emissions trajectory for India and one that is consistent with global efforts at addressing climate change. Looking at the role of trade in climate change, it concludes that the outcome will be messy if the trading system is burdened with the task of settling environmental problems.||ARVIND SUBRAMANIAN,NANCY BIRDSALL,AADITYA MATTOO

The changes in historiography are not necessarily a mere process of evolution, but are shaped by continuous intellectual struggles, rooted in ideological influences, political interests and material concerns. Inherent in these struggles are a variety of issues like the concept of nationalism, the future of democracy and the practice of secularism.

This essay reflects on the systemic implications of these changes from the point of view of the transition to an enlarged and dominating sphere of capital in the economy. There are a number of checks and balances and road bumps that will make the progress of capital in India halting and hesitant, and the democratic processes, however imperfect, will partly tame its brutalities. The Indian transition is thus bound to be rather tortuous, though in the long run inexorable, and its narrative will be more complex than usual.||PRANAB BARDHAN

It is fair to say that these reforms have not sufficiently succeeded in improving either the social standing of dalits or their economic condition. It is no wonder, then, that the dalits are found, along with the tribals, in the bottom quintile on most parameters of human well-being. How does one explain the intractability of the dalit problem?

The fact that China has succeeded therefore should lead us to question our textbook doctrines of development. Much of this paper is presented as a comparative study of India, China and, briefly, other Asian nations. It is shown that the mainsprings of development in these nations are widely different, even though their trajectories of growth are converging. The paper argues that social and political priming plays a major role in determining which economic policies will work. In the case of China, while the liberalisation from 1978 onwards was important, the social preconditioning achieved during the high-noon of the Maoist period, up to 1978, was no less significant. In judging the sustainability of growth in Asia it is essential to keep these social and political factors in mind.||KAUSHIK BASU

The current paper examines reasons behind the rapid increase in the marriage age over 1900-50 among the Chitpavan brahmins of Maharashtra. In particular, the project of fashioning the emerging nation, an ideology widely shared, is highlighted as an important factor behind the increase in the age at marriage for middle class women in western India.||Neeraj Hatekar,Abodh Kumar,Rajani Mathur

Two main empirical techniques — the gravity model and the computable general equilibrium model — have been used in the growing number of empirical studies, which have generated numbers related to very large welfare gains and a three or four times increase in intra-regional trade. In this paper, I critically evaluate such quantitative studies by comparing and contrasting the results systematically. The evaluation demonstrates that there is considerable uncertainty about the reliability of empirical assessments. The diversity of the results suggests that these studies are not capable of convincing policymakers and negotiators about the impact of preferential trading within the region. Therefore, repeating similar exercises is not worthwhile without improving the reliability of empirical analysis by addressing the limitations of previous studies.||JAYATILLEKE S BANDARA

It presents the various ways of understanding demand deficiency, which was the underlying feature of the earlier downturns in capitalist economies. A resolution of the problems faced then was possible with demand management using Keynesian tools. But the current economic crisis is different from the past ones and the lessons learnt from the past may not be applicable to solving the crisis of 2009. The arguments presented here imply that demand management alone will not work because capitalism faces a basic crisis. One implication is that we need redistribution, but that is not on anyone's agenda today.||Arun Kumar

It says that the vote for the UPA was mostly independent of a voter's perception of the performance of his or her state government. In addition, even after controlling for state-specific factors there were some political cleavages that influenced that vote for the UPA and the NDA. This suggests that national factors did have an influence on the vote for the 2009 Lok Sabha elections though state-level factors continued to be important.||PRADEEP CHHIBBER

An Inquiry||India's services sector-led growth since the 1990s remains a puzzle – it has taken place at a low level of per capita income, without a proportionate transformation in the workforce, and amidst a deceleration in agriculture and a stagnation in industry. This paper argues that the output of services is perhaps overestimated since computing value added in services and finding suitable price deflators for them is difficult even in the best of circumstances. The answer to the puzzle, therefore, lies (at least partially) in the deterioration in economic statistics, and the use of a widely acknowledged faulty methodology. More specifically, services output seems overestimated due to (i) the inflated estimate of the growth of the private corporate sector, ( ii) a slower rise in the services deflator, and in particular (iii) of an overstatement of the decline in the prices of communications services.||R.

Econometric results indicate that trade liberalisation in India had a positive effect on the labour demand elasticity. However, the estimated elasticity for the post-reform period (1991 onwards) is found to be lower than that for the pre-reform period. A closer examination reveals a marked upward trend in the labour demand elasticity after the mid-1990s, which seems attributable, among other factors, to trade liberalisation, weakening of trade union bargaining power and labour market reforms.||BISHWANATH GOLDAR

In recent years, most of these struggles have been directed against the impact of the liberalising state on the rural poor. For the vast majority, there has been an erosion of livelihood avenues, food insecurity, a loss of assets — owing largely to the loss of their traditional access and control of natural resources. Food security is threatened by loss of biodiversity and loss of knowledge. Women who suffer the most from these trends have in all movements related to these issues, participating intensely, widely and also in leadership roles. While many of these movements have been documented, very little is known of women claiming their rights within these movements. At the same time, many other struggles of women are ongoing for land and other resource rights. These efforts have been isolated but exchanges of experiences are growing and suggest a range of newer strategies are emerging, thereby opening up possibilities for more effective response and common struggles.||MEERA VELAYUDHAN

The data show that intra-state disparities are also increasing.

Vulnerability conceptualised in terms of several socio-economic and demographic indicators exists among most of the social categories though the relative size of deprivation varies across social groups. In a binomial logit framework, based on the pooled sample, the extent of decline in the probability of experiencing well-being beyond a threshold limit is sharper for the socially backward classes than the others. However, in individual cities such a pattern is not so conspicuous implying that all the social categories are equally vulnerable. These findings have important policy implications, indicating that policy initiatives for deprived areas irrespective of caste factor are more important than the caste-based support measures.||RAJNISH KUMAR,SATENDRA KUMAR,ARUP MITRA

At one time ULFA symbolised, for many in Assam, a point of resistance to Indian hegemony. But the extortions, killings, bomb blasts, targeting of civilians and of migrant workers from north Indian states, led to erosion of whatever support and sympathy it enjoyed. Today the outfit is on the defensive mode.||UDAYON MISRA

Two factors that have abetted this failure relate, one, to the conventional emphasis on macro-management and an arm's length relationship with the regulatees, and, two, to the belief that the market is endowed with the capacity to periodically readjust itself to changing requirements. This article first considers the evolutionary aspects of corporate and regulatory management. It is recognised that regulatory failure extends to many other areas. Four cases are cited to illustrate this aspect. The modus operandi of those engaged in fraudulent behaviour and how the regulatory agencies have a handicap in addressing systemic failure are discussed. While emphasising the need for a road map, the article outlines a few directions in which the first steps have to be taken.||A. Premchand

Subramanian ("Preventing and Responding to the Crisis of 2018", EPW, 10 January 2009) does the same for India's macro-policy responses following the financial crisis. But the arguments of the two sets of proposals are inconsistent. Mattoo and Subramanian want India to support a proposal to give the World Trade Organisation enforcement powers against undervalued exchange rates, but Subramanian wants India to follow self-insurance as China did. The reason for the inconsistency may be the authors' preference for India to follow the United States' interests in international negotiations, but to follow its own interests when domestic policy is involved.||Ashima Goyal

It illustrates how the state as an institution has been limited in its capacity to protect these enclosed spaces simply through the policy of "fences and fines''. The main tenet of the national park model was the complete removal of humans resident within the park area and to preserve the area in its pristine form in order to protect wildlife. This case study of Kanha examines how relatively powerless groups unite in their hopelessness to protest against a system or institution that has its own agendas in conservation.||Ananya Mukherjee

The experience of VimoSEWA indicates that health insurance must be firmly linked to an effective public health system. A high percentage of claims for preventable illness, unnecessary expenditure on medicines, increasing hysterectomies and inequitable claims patterns are four trends that are likely to be seen in the implementation of RSBY. To ensure that health insurance plays its intended role, appropriate investment in prevention, particularly in water and sanitation, as also, community involvement and a strengthened public sector are essential.||SAPNA DESAI

But the Indian labour market has already achieved a substantial degree of flexibility by the contractualisation of factory workers. This paper critically investigates the claims made in favour of introducing greater flexibility in the labour market. The analysis is done through an empirical inquiry into the proposition that casualisation of labour leads to higher output and employment growth. We find that employment and output growth do not have a statistically significant dependence on labour market flexibility in Indian organised manufacturing.||Atulan Guha

This paper examines the source of the initial M in the making of Indian immigrant entrepreneurs in the us, a disproportionately greater percentage of whom have trained in India's elite technical institutes. Given the leading role of technology in the world economy and the emergence of the information technology sector, specialised technical skills have assumed unique importance relative to other forms of labour. These skills are not acquired by the exclusive financial contribution of the family or the intellectual endeavour of the individual, but by the sociial capital and the cultural stimulus of the Indian society. In this specific context, the M in the M→C→M¹ thesis of Marx could be defined as sc, which underlies the making of the Indian immigrant entrepreneurs in the us.||Roli Varma,Daya R. Varma

Ensuring transparency, accountability and efficiency in the age-old institutional arrangement is difficult. Thus, computerisation is an effort towards land administration reforms that overcomes certain issues pertaining to records management. This has reduced the work burden of revenue functionaries, brought down the number of land disputes and lowered the cost of transactions. Further, it has also brought efficiency in the delivery of services.

Existing empirical studies on FDI spillovers largely look at the productivity enhancing effects and horizontal spillovers of foreign firms in the same industry sector ignoring the possibility of spillovers through buyer-supplier or backward linkages. The present study examines the impact of horizontal as well as backward spillovers from the presence of foreign firms, on the export performance of domestic firms in the Indian manufacturing industry during 1993-2008. Increased competition in the domestic market post-liberalisation through sales of foreign firms is forcing domestic firms to look for export markets. The results indicate that domestic firms are not benefited in improving their export performance through any buyer-supplier linkages with the MNES.||T J JOSEPH,V NAGI REDDY

It highlights the shadow banking system, which lacked the explicit backing of a monetary authority on the one hand, and escaped largely its regulation on the other. This system fostered a circular rather than a vertical network of credit interdependence, which had its advantages but was also spectacularly vulnerable. The financial system may be stable and flush with liquidity through injection, but in the absence of sufficient demand for liquidity from the real economy, the depressive economic conditions may continue. The politics of trying to save capitalism by saving only the financial capitalists may well turn out to be the last twist of the knife from free market fundamentalism to pave the way for a deeper and lasting recession.||Amit Bhaduri

The National Election Study 2009 survey indicates that voters did not consider some of the issues highlighted by political parties to have much relevance to them and these had almost no impact on voting decisions. They included, for instance, the Bharatiya Janata Party's campaign issues such as the Indo-United States nuclear deal and the Ram Sethu controversy. However, economic concerns, basic services, welfare policies and citizens' security were significant in influencing voting decisions. Surprisingly, the United Progressive Alliance's vote did not suffer much even though the price rise and terrorist attacks during the government's term in office were matters of concern to a majority of the voters.||PRAVEEN RAI

However, a more dynamic approach reveals that imports are not only dependent on tariff reduction, but equally on productivity differences, the structure of markets and the exchange rate. Moreover, the FTA takes into account the threat of import competition through safeguard measures when there is substantial injury to domestic producers. The primary issues lie in the sphere of production, agricultural research and innovation, rather than protection under the FTA.||K J JOSEPH

Gandhi initiated a systematic effort to standardise the Gujarati language in the 1920s through the Gujarat Vidyapith which published a dictionary with a set of rules for correct Gujarati writing. It is this form of Gujarati that has been recognised by the state government as the standard language.

The basic problem is not the imbalances perse, but the unsustainable way financial deregulation and neoliberal global order absorbed and recycled them. The us has lost much of its capacity to either absorb or recycle trade surpluses generated elsewhere. So, in addition to reasserting public control over the credit creation process, the us has to be prepared in case the dollar plunges in value, and focus on how to resume the recycling of trade surpluses before contraction begins to destroy them. The global monetary standard and thus the integrity of monetary reserves need to be safeguarded, and a recycling of trade surpluses would wean world demand away from its dependence on us overspending without the world getting stuck in a depression.||Korkut Ertürk

The presence of sitting legislators as associate members of the commission has also given cause for complaint of unfair functioning of the commission.||Sanjay Kumar

On the one hand, India does not want any constraints on its development prospects. On the other, it also wants to be seen as an emerging global power that requires a leadership role on key global issues like climate change. It can either approach climate change as a "stand alone" global negotiation, or, weave these negotiations into a "grand bargain" involving linkages with other international negotiations. In order to understand these issues better, a conference on climate change held in New Delhi in March 2009 focused on the different bargains India might have to strike, both domestically and internationally, to respond to these challenges. The papers presented here highlight some of the key issues raised in the conference and also the analysis and interpretation of the main points of discussion.||DEVESH KAPUR,RADHIKA KHOSLA,PRATAP BHANU MEHTA

It can cement the gains made by litigation, but it should not be restricted to that. It is an opportunity to draw upon domestic practice and jurisprudence, international law, and legislation in other jurisdictions to comprehensively codify the right to food. Most importantly, a new law is an opportunity to provide accessible administrative and legal remedies for individuals whose right to food is violated.||SURABHI CHOPRA

Its strategy of compulsory acquisition of even highly arable land to facilitate industrialisation under private auspices was ill-founded, and worse in its implementation. The 14 March 2007 killings in Nandigram shocked the people of the State. How on earth could a Left administration shoot down in cold blood women and children from impoverished peasant families? The resulting widespread public revulsion led to the erosion of the Party's mass base. But all is not lost, for the Party still has a dedicated band of workers who, if given the call, will forthwith form the vanguard of radical activism.||A. M.

In this essay, the emergence of sovereignty formations around film stars is discussed with particular reference to Rajnikanth, in the context of the challenge posed to such formations by a newly triumphant commodity logic. Far from solving the problem of sovereignty, however, the corrosive power of the economic logic may be expected to create new political crises.||M. Madhava Prasad

China and the Collapse of the American Model||"Chimerica" illustrates the interactions between a Chinese model ofhighsavings, over-investment and export-led growth and the us model of leveraged investment, credit consumption and finance-led growth. The collapse of the us model, linked with the unregulated derivatives market, has driven China to redirect its growth towards domestic consumption, despite the strengthening of regionalisation in east Asia. Yet, China's stimulus plan, based on investment, is limited by both income disparities and the underdevelopment of social protection. Land reform, or the collective redistribution of the remaining state assets, could stimulate domestic consumption. But the first solution deprives the local state of financial resources, and the second solution collides with the interests of the state-party system. However, stronger social movements could lead to a better income distribution. Like two faces of the same coin, credit consumption and a high savings rate reflect the crisis of a global accumulation regime, tailored for a financial oligarchy in the us, or for a party-state oligarchy in China.||Guilhem Fabre

Though Keynes was concerned with a short-run problem, Schumpeter was concerned with the long-run dynamics of the capitalist system. Given the present financial crisis, it is possible to argue that the true rationale of a stimulus package in countries such as India that are still low in terms of their average level of living ought to be to address fundamental, long-term, rather than short-term, issues.||Pulin B.

Economies of scale drive the retail sector towards rapid growth in terms of size of outlets and dominance in geographical and product markets, posing challenges for preservation of genuine competition. Growth in size also has consequences for manufacturers, wholesalers and dealers in the supply chain who face a loss of alternative marketing/retail outlets as monopolies emerge. The growth of large format retail raises serious issues for the urban environment and town planning in dense and rapidly urbanising countries like India.

Hydro-diplomacy in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin is still based on reductionist engineering, and looks at marginal economic benefits, without showing any concern for the long-run implications for livelihoods and ecosystem. The governments in the river basin are already facing the challenge of extreme poverty, despite the countries experiencing high levels of precipitation. This paper discusses the lacunae of the reductionist engineering paradigm, and stresses the need for a holistic framework in ecological engineering and for hydro-diplomacy in the basin. This framework is based on a new transdisciplinary knowledge base created by the emerging science of eco-hydrology, economics, and new institutional theories.||JAYANTA BANDYOPADHYAY,NILANJAN GHOSH

It examines patterns of political awareness, participation, distribution of benefits by gram panchayats, and voting across households of varying socio-economic characteristics. The main findings are that (i) political participation was high on average; (ii) within villages panchayat benefits flowed to poor and scheduled caste/scheduled tribe groups on par or better, compared with the rest of the population; (iii) distribution of benefits across villages was biased against those with more landless households; and (iv) the lasting political success of the Left owed partly to a clientelist relationship of the party with the voters, and partly to the gratitude of voters of low socio-economic status arising out of broad-based changes.||Pranab Bardhan,Sandip Mitra,Dilip Mookherjee,Abhirup Sarkar

Though most of the violence by Ravi Dasi dalits was directed against public property and reflected their general anger at the Vienna incident, the mainstream media was quick to-interpret it as yet another instance of caste conflict within Sikhism, viz, between dalit Sikhs and upper caste Sikhs. Such misrepresentations of caste and religious realities of Punjab today could lead to a communal divide between dalits and mainstream Sikhism. Based on an empirical study of the Punjabi Ravi Dasis, the paper tries to provide a historical perspective on caste and religion in Punjab today.||Surinder S. Jodhka

Exploring the evocations of nature, religion and nation in different phases by these two groups of actors, it argues that through a regular use of certain mythical beliefs and simplified dichotomies, there was an inadvertent collaboration between green and saffron. The Tehri dam became a means of combining sacredness with impulse, gravity of high politics with solemnity of daily worship, and nature with nationalism.||Mukul Sharma

Exploring the question from different vantage points, it argues that the long history of the women's movement in India from the 19th century onwards has been fundamentally international in scope within which the "nation" occupied a troubled position. The more recent challenges of caste and sexuality are further reasons to question a unidimensional conceptualisation of the present. The very pressing uncertainties besetting the future of the women's movement in India - and elsewhere - would be better appreciated within a "post-national" as against a "global" conjunctural analysis.||Mary E.

First, although the gender budgeting statements still suffer from flaws in methodology, it is clear that women are accorded low priority in government spending on development. Second, the creation of an independent Ministry of Women and Child Development has not resulted in any significant change in priorities for women. Third, a whopping 42% decline in allocations for schemes meant for women's welfare under the MWCD in the union budget 2009-10 puts a big question mark on how serious the UPA is in its stated commitment to women's empowerment.||YAMINI MISHRA,BHUMIKA JHAMB

Researchers have surprisingly concluded that internal migration within Asian countries is high and increasing over time. This alarmist perspective could be attributed to the projection of urban population made by the Population Division of the United Nations and other national and international agencies. This has guided governments of several countries, leading to measures to control inflow of people for security concerns or to reduce pressure on limited amenities in the destination regions. In this context, the paper examines the proposition that rural-urban migration has accelerated over the recent decades in the Asia countries, particularly during the 1990s, incorporating the history, social fabric and political environment in the explanatory framework.||AMITABH KUNDU

The papers - one based on a large sample quantitative survey across all districts and the others on close ethnographic observation of six purposively selected gram panchayats - find merit in both the explanations suggested in the literature on contemporary West Bengal politics: one, the institutional effectiveness of the structures of rural government and mobilisation of political support built by the Left Front and, two, a form of dientelism in which the Left parties hold their supporters under some sort of permanent dependence. The studies, however, propose several nuanced modifications of the arguments and also offer some new explanations for our consideration. However, several critical events have taken place in West Bengal since 2006 (Nandigram, Singur, the results of the panchayat election of 2008). Is it then possible to shift our perspective and read the results reported in these studies as an answer to a different question? Instead of the question that has been conventionally asked about West Bengal, could we ask: "What are the reasons internal to the institutions of government and politics in rural West Bengal that might endanger the stability of Left Front rule?"

To begin with, the US could take the initiative in formulating domestic policy to start absorbing a significant proportion of the most vulnerable climate exiles from small island states. It could raise and attend to an urgent issue on the impacts of warming and at the same time claim a leadership position in global climate negotiations by tacitly accepting its historic responsibility for climate change.||SUJATHA BYRAVAN,SUDHIR CHELLA RAJAN

Realism remained at the margins of this celluloid text since it did not fit this dominant discourse. Urdu writers, many of them Muslims, who were often part of the leftist progressive writers' movement, questioned these seamless narratives. This paper tries to reopen the history of realism in Bombay's popular cinema by exploring the role of the Urdu writer of this period by engaging with a recent film, Khoya Khoya Chand and its protagonist who appears to have been moulded on Saadat Hasan Manto.||RUPLEENA BOSE

In recent months, there have been widespread calls for a regulatory overhaul of financial markets regulation. But there is little agreement on what those specific changes should be. If the power and influence of private finance is not reined in, we will return to the destructive deregulation/bailout dynamic that has characterised the last several decades.

This paper looks at the nature of commercialised biotech products, the changing locus of agricultural research, the emerging market failures in biotech product development, and the likely impact on poverty and employment. The evidence shows that Bt cotton is scale neutral and profitable to all groups of farmers. But research in biotechnology is mainly in the hands of a few large multinational companies which focus on crops and traits that are significant to the developed countries and not the resource-poor farmers. The public sector, therefore, must step in to pursue basic research that will benefit the poorer farmers.||N CHANDRASEKHARA RAO,S MAHENDRA DEV

However, we must accept that the existing urbanisation models are unsustainable at the Indian scale and there is no available alternative trajectory. The international climate change negotiations can be seen as an opportunity to create an environment that will help in the discovery of a more sustainable urbanisation. This paper explores a limited set of emergent issues that will have to be considered as India develops its domestic approach to urbanisation, while negotiating its international position on climate change. It is structured into three broad sections, viz, (a) the feedback loops from urbanisation to climate change and vice versa, (b) actions needed at multiple levels to influence these processes, and (c) the implications of these for India's negotiating position on climate change.||PARTHA MUKHOPADHYAY,AROMAR REVI

It first examines how the term "tribe" evolved to designate a set of negative traits, shaped under colonialism's response to escalating tribal resistance to their rule. It then studies Christianity in its dual role of providing support to colonial rule as well as succour to the "tribals". The paper argues that the colonial state merely transformed pre-colonial prejudices of brahmanical texts and gave them a social Darwinian twist. Unfortunately, the view of tribals as a lower evolutionary form of civilisation continues in nationalist India.||JOSEPH BARA

On the issue of industrialisation, the real issue is whether it occurs through subservience to the logic of capital or it occurs without compromising the dialectics of subversion of the logic of capital. Subscribing to the view that the only immediate choice is between "development" and an attempt to overthrow the system negates any scope for Left politics. The scope for Left politics arises by rejecting this binary choice, by transcending the problematic that the only immediate choice is between subservience to the logic of capital and attempting to overthrow the system. Transcending this problematic is precisely the resolution of the theoretical crisis of the Left. And the possibility of politics that is created thereby will also resolve the practical crisis of the Left.||PRABHAT PATNAIK

However, pulses production has been stagnant at between 11 and 14 million tonnes over the last two decades. Per capita pulses consumption over the years has come down from 61gm/day in 1951 to 30 gm/day in 2008. This paper analyses the status of pulses production technology, constraints in cultivation of pulses and the possibilities of increasing production. It emphasises the expansion of area under short duration varieties, development of multiple disease/pest resistance varieties, use of micro-nutrients like zinc and sulphur and increase in area under rabi pulse crops to increase pulses production. The minimum support price is not effective for pulse crops; prevailing market prices should be taken into account while fixing the MSP to bridge the gap between demand and supply.||A AMARENDER REDDY

In the run-up to the enactment of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act, the debate was somewhat derailed by a loud anti-NREGA lobby, particularly vocal in the business press. Hopefully, the debate on the RTF Act will be more productive. Politically, the main challenge is to ensure that the Act is not trivialised, by reducing it to the electoral promise of "25 kgs at Rs 3/kg for BPL households". The ultimate shape of the RTF Act will depend on whether the government merely seeks to gain "political capital" from it, or whether it is guided by its responsibility to the people of this country.||Reetika Khera

This article argues that such division of geopolitical space is no longer valid and there has been a dissolution and blurring of lines which identified one with the other. Through a review of different countries in the South, this article shows how both objective criteria and self-identification often do not follow the North-South binary.

The high priority to social sector spending has posed serious challenges to the state in terms of upkeep and also in tackling second generation problems of its model of development.

It indicates undercounting and reflects the informality that surrounds women's work. This paper seeks to explore the nature of women's workforce participation and attempts to identify key factors influencing women's decision to work, the type of work they do, the constraints they face, and the perceived benefits and costs of engaging in paid work outside the home. In doing so, issues surrounding the methodology and underestimation of women's work within the urban context are also tackled. The study also suggests the need to understand the familial and household context within which labour market decisions are made. The role of family and kinship structures to determine women's work-life choices emerge as an important area for further study.||RATNA M SUDARSHAN,SHRAYANA BHATTACHARYA

This crisis is the latest phase of the evolution of financial markets under the radical financial deregulation process that began in the late 1970s. This evolution has taken the form of cycles in which deregulation accompanied by rapid financial innovation stimulates powerful financial booms that end in crises. Governments respond to crises with bailouts that allow new expansions to begin. As a result, financial markets have become ever larger and financial crises have become more threatening to society, which forces governments to enact ever larger bailouts. This paper analyses the structural flaws in the current United States financial system that helped bring on the current crisis.||James Crotty

However, as an analysis of the act's implementation in Andhra Pradesh shows, it has turned into a bureaucratic exercise instead of an empowerment tool. The ingrained patriarchal view of the State and its reluctance to grant the claimants — men and women — community rights to the land they were tilling all these years reveal that the profit motive and integration into larger global capital markets drive its forest development programmes. In the process, the women are becoming wage labourers carrying out the government's programmes of plantation rather than exercising their traditional knowledge to nurture forests and gain rightful livelihoods.||SAGARI R RAMDAS

While women's work and women as workers suffer exclusion from protective legislation, this paper traces the trajectory of simultaneous exclusion and inclusion of women by going back to some of the seminal documents that were the outcomes of officially constituted commissions and committees.

It engages with specific aspects of ineffectiveness of protective labour laws as far as women are concerned.

In this view, RWAS belong to a new politics representing an emerging partnership between civil society, the reforming state and private capital, aimed at reclaiming urban governance from the messy dealings of electoral democracy. The urban poor, meanwhile, are perceived as organised predominantly through the sphere of politics. This paper, using survey and ethnographic data on neighbourhood associations in Chennai, argues that these accounts are over-schematised. There are considerable overlaps between civil and political society: the urban poor increasingly resort to civil associational forms to claim urban citizenship, and middle class associations are more deeply engaged with the sphere of formal politics than their own or scholarly accounts convey.||Karen Coelho,T.

Does it mean that instead of worrying about disparity in social indicators we should rather focus on disparity in per capita income? This paper argues that there are certain relevant aspects of disparity in non-income dimensions across and within states. In the context of resource allocation by a federal government among sub-national entities, the paper examines the ethical implications of two well-known allocation rules, population-weighted utilitarianism and leximin, and argues that the implications are not the same across evaluative spaces. It then examines if the actual resource allocation for human development in India conforms to some normative criteria.||Achin Chakraborty

The ideal woman it envisages is seva- oriented, and differs from the feminists who extol individualism. Her modernity lies in her physical discipline, mental training, her awareness of social issues, her rootedness in family without getting trapped by the purely domestic for collective cultural regeneration of the Hindu Rashtra. Globalisation is not condemned but seen as an opportunity to achieve this ideal.||Swati Dyahadroy

Growth of real informal wage and productivity across all states in India since the early 1990s is an interesting starting point. While it is not a foregone conclusion that a liberal economic environment necessarily benefits such sectors, marketfriendly policies can improve the real income of informal workers and thus can have a substantial effect on urban poverty. Some supportive evidence to this effect has led to analytical models that investigate these issues closely. The analysis here shows that deregulated economies may benefit the informal workers, by raising both wages and employment under certain conditions that depend on inter-sectoral capital mobility. In the process, agriculture and formal manufacturing may suffer. Labour and commodity market reform may I lave different and contradictory impact on informal labour. Organisational changes in production in a more open economy increase the degree of specialisation, help informal entrepreneurs, and promote exports. Lower tariffs and lower interest rates have opposite impacts on the informal segment of import competitive industries.||Sugata Marjit,Saibal Kar

Cost recovery through upfront beneficiary contributions is increasingly becoming a key consideration in the provision of piped water and sewerage. This paper examines the Greater Bangalore Water and Sanitation Project, a project that aims to extend piped water from the Cauvery to over two million residents in peri-urban Bangalore. The paper critically evaluates the project and makes four interlinked arguments: (1) Upfront payments from citizens have not guaranteed timely and satisfactory service. (2) The project's financial model is disconnected from actually existing settlement and urbanisation patterns, thus delaying water delivery and undermining accountability. (3) The project's highly centralised decision-making process has resulted in low political buy-in and public acceptance. (4) Modifications to the original financial model have been crucial in sustaining credibility and getting the project off the ground.||MALINI RANGANATHAN,LALITHA KAMATH,VINAY BAINDUR

This recognised the basic rights of individuals as citizens and their collectively held cultural rights as members of communities. However, this framework has now been replaced by a new form of pluralist discourse that totalises interests and community identities, and this has resulted in a battle between majoritarian and minoritarian communalism. The Congress-led coalition's victory in the 2009 Lok Sabha poll has given it a second chance after 2004 to restore the secularisation process by shifting the focus of the development discourse from communality to the backwardness of groups, which has remained submerged within every community of faith.||D L SHETH

The loss of accessibility for pedestrians is one of the most important of these negative impacts, which remains neglected by policy. Urban transport planning is fundamentally about moral and political choices — about what kind of cities we want for ourselves and our future generations, whether urban space is primarily for people or motor vehicles, and what we owe each other. While motor vehicles play a vitally important role, as do planning and infrastructure for them, and technological measures to mitigate their impacts, an urban transport policy that focuses on these measures to the exclusion of infrastructure for walking and other non-motorised modes is likely to prove futile, even counter-productive. There is, therefore, an urgent need for an integrated approach that addresses multiple impacts, caters to multiple modes and road users, and is sensitive to the needs, capabilities and constraints in the Indian context.||MADHAV G BADAMI

In a context where marketisation of higher education continues unabated and the government is keen to encourage private sector involvement, it is necessary to analyse their impact on the three stated objectives of expansion, inclusion and excellence. It is therefore crucial to understand how the market for higher education works and to critically examine the actual impact of the market on education in India.

This question should give us pause before we make little of Gandhi's legacy. Uncertain and imperfect though our democracy may be, it is still the world's largest, and it functions for the most part. All of us who value this form of governance ought to remember that we owe it to Gandhi, more than to anyone else, for giving us a start in the right direction. If Gandhi is to be measured in terms of charkhas, frugality and prayer meetings then certainly he is of little consequence today. But a sociological appreciation of Gandhi would take us beyond these emblematic acts to the unintended consequences of what he did and stood for.

The provision of monogamy was meant to protect Hindu women from polygamy. But how successful has the Hindu Marriage Act been in eradicating polygamy? There is no systematically collected data to assess this. However, it is quite clear that the government does not run campaigns to disseminate legal information the way it does with polio, AIDS or family planning.

This paper suggests a model for understanding how the Communist Party of India (Marxist) "machinery" functions to secure electoral power and ideological hegemony for the left regime, especially at the panchayat level in everyday village politics. The protean capacity of the party allows changes at the local level in pragmatic ways, serving incompatible interests without being seen as different formations. The CPI(M) is clearly adept in formulating different strategies for different tiers of the panchayat system, calibrating their rivalries. Two village narratives help explore these aspects.||Rajarshi Dasgupta

The serious adverse impact of the current crisis should awaken India to the need for effective self-insurance in the future. If self-insurance becomes an important policy objective, the government will need to revisit its macroeconomic policy, including exchange rate management and capital account convertibility.

This demands shared engagement in political struggle and social interaction in shared neighbourhoods. This paper seeks explanations for the failure of civil society in Ahmedabad, which has experienced many riots in the past, to raise a collective voice of protest against deliberate acts of violence by the State, and also in battling undemocratic groups within its own sphere. A historical exploration of the segmentation of residential spaces in the city and its subsequent intensification has led to a weakening of the scope of civil society engagement. However, the translation of prejudice, discrimination and communal sentiments into brutal acts of violence demanded a trigger — provided by the Sangh parivar, which came to command state politics since the mid-1990s, and has rendered the civil society helpless.||NEERA CHANDHOKE

The thought of Tagore and Periyar offers us at least two premises to re-imagine politics beyond the nation-form. First, politics has to be a perennial contestation of different forms of power by acknowledging and addressing difference as the fundamental reality of the social. Second, a politics beyond the nation has to be based on a de- territorialised imagination that surpasses the territorial parochialism of the nation-form and embraces the world as a terrain of possibilities, alliances, and constraints.||M.

It attempts to make sense of various puzzles, particularly the decline of average calorie intake during the last 25 years. This decline has occurred across the distribution of real per capita expenditure, in spite of increases in real income and no long-term increase in the relative price of food. One hypothesis is that calorie requirements have declined due to lower levels of physical activity or improvements in the health environment. If correct, this does not imply that there are no calorie deficits in the Indian population — nothing could be further from the truth. These deficits are reflected in some of the worst anthropometric indicators in the world, and the sluggish rate of improvement of these indicators is of major concern. Yet recent trends remain confused and there is an urgent need for better nutrition monitoring.||Angus Deaton,Jean Drèze

What was so compelling in its message that it could uproot an entire project of migration and settlement and turn it upside down? Why would thousands of migrants, from different regions of India, but predominantly the Sikhs from the Punjab, suddenly become interested in waging an armed struggle against British colonialism? These questions can be better addressed if we switch the Ghadar movement from the cultural register of Indian nationalism to the revolutionary theories and practices of the Russian anarchists. What is also striking about the Ghadar Party was that unlike many contemporary militant organisations, it was actively hostile to religion.||HARJOT OBEROI

This calls for a strong restraint in acceding to numerous demands for tax reliefs, special assistance and "bailouts" from different groups claiming to be affected by the crisis. Such relief must be discriminating, temporary and kept to the minimum. The focus of fiscal policy must be on reviewing policies and making such changes as will protect the interests of growth over the longer term.||A. Vaidyanathan

However, very little is known of child labour in industrial outwork. The aim of this paper is twofold: on the one hand, to understand whether children in home-based work households are more likely to work than other children and, if so, how this impacts their capabilities; and, on the other, to outline policy implications for India. This paper draws on ad hoc surveys and a country study carried out in India. It examines the incidence of child work in such households, the child's schooling, and reasons why children are working, their work conditions, and gender issues. Econometric analysis is applied to analyse the determinants of child activity status. Policy implications are spelled out at the end.||Mario Biggeri,Santosh Mehrotra,Ratna M. Sudarshan

Today's economic crisis and labour's response cannot be a replay of the 1930s and yet one can learn from that historical experience. The left around the world presently finds itself in a difficult position without, in most places, a strong socialist organisation or a powerful labour movement. The key to the development of the labour and social movements and of a socialist movement in the United States and in Europe will be, as it was in the early 1930s, the development of militant minorities, ginger groups in the workplace and unions, in communities, and in the various fronts that challenge the status quo.||Dan La Botz

4/4/2009-10/4/2009||special article||40278699||Macro Policy Reform and Sub-National Finance: Why Is the Fiscal Space of the States Shrinking?||In the post-economic liberalisation era, financial sector and fiscal reforms by the central government have adversely affected sub-national finances. The centre's fiscal consolidation measures have contributed to the sharp decline in vertical transfers and the financial liberalisation-induced increase in interest rates has widened the resource gap of the states through an increase in the interest outgo on the stock of debt. This paper examines the effect of the fiscal imbalance on the sub-national fiscal space. Econometric estimates reveal that though the effect of the cost of debt on total expenditure is expansionary, it is negative with respect to the fiscal space. As the sub-national fiscal space has been shrinking, corrective measures are required to increase the states' ability to fulfil developmental fiscal needs.||Pinaki Chakraborty,Anit N. Mukherjee,H. K.

The key structural aspects include a significant shift from official to private capital flows and from debt to non-debt flows. Non-resident Indian deposits show considerable sensitivity to interest and exchange rate fluctuations. The corporate preference for overseas borrowings is predominantly influenced by domestic activity; but the persistence of interest rate arbitrage and global credit market shocks also have a significant impact. Foreign institutional investment inflows and stock prices have a bidirectional causal relationship with a time varying nature of the stock price volatility. Volatile capital flows rather than trade flows seem to drive real exchange rate movements with consequences for the real economy.||BHUPAL SINGH

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Indian patriotism was projected as Hindu nationalism. Rabindranath Tagore's Gora, published in 1909 in the immediate aftermath of the anti- partition Swadeshi movement of 1903-08, overcomes the ethnocentricities that led to such a distortion, but, in it, the particular comes too close to the universal-patriotism dissolves into love for all the helpless peoples of the world, offering a radically new way of being an Indian patriot.||Tanika Sarkar

The Maoists do not expand the democratic space available for mass movements but rather mirror the repressive structures of the very state they are fighting. Genuine resistance to exploitation and oppression has come from radical mass movements which have built diverse coalitions on the ground and which have experimented with alternatives to the state. Anarchist is not an abuse which can be hurled at the Maoists, rather it is a resource for people fighting power structures.||NIVEDITA MENON

If the Annex I countries follow these trajectories, they would meet the Kyoto Protocol commitment in terms of the stock of emissions since 2008, only in 2021 or 2024. The financial support from these countries for the developing world is a tiny fraction of what is needed. The Annex I countries need to adopt a much more aggressive target for emission reduction by 2020 and offer much stronger support for mitigation and adaptation if they are serious about climate protection.||Daljit Singh,Girish Sant,Ashok Sreenivas

Nehru believed that maximum autonomy could neutralise sovereignty aspirations but the Naga insistence on independence combined with armed opposition to the Indian state compelled him to send the army and hardened his stance. The non-resolution of the Naga issue made him introspect as to why he was unable to "win them over" and he admitted that he may have erred in his approach. Yet, despite his failure, Nehru's model of dealing with the Nagas has become the standard mode for dealing with minority nationalisms in south Asia.||SAJAL NAG

It focuses on the creation of a new regime of accumulation (neoliberalism) since the 1970s as a response to the profitability crisis of the late 1960s and 1970s in global capitalism. The regime, while addressing that crisis, could never fully address it in the sustained realisation of profits/surplus value. What then of the efficacy of a Keynesian fix? From a Marxian viewpoint, the Keynesian solution is also inherently unstable as state-supported capitalism invariably runs into other crises (such as in the 1970s), which would force further changes in the system. Marxian prescriptions would go beyond the market vis-à-vis state debate to focus on the very institutional structures that perpetuate capitalism of one kind or the other.||Vamsi Vakulabharanam

Despite evidence to the contrary, this ratio is often characterised in terms of a diagonal divide with low 0-6 sex ratios in northern and western India and normal 0-6 sex ratios in eastern and southern India. While unexpectedly high rates of female infant mortality have been reported in Tamil Nadu, it is still regarded as lying outside the ambit of states with unusually low 0-6 sex ratios. Based on an analysis of patterns in sex ratio at birth, infant mortality rates and under-5 mortality rates for Tamil Nadu, this paper traces the development of daughter deficit in the state and examines the validity of the diagonal divide in sex ratios across India. We find evidence of daughter deficit in more than half the state's districts with a majority of the shortfall arising before birth. The evidence presented here, combined with earlier work on declining 0-6 sex ratios outside northwestern India, suggests that the diagonal divide is no longer an appropriate distinction.||Sharada Srinivasan,Arjun S.

The state, which faces an acute shortage of qualified gynaecologists in public health facilities, devised the Chiranjeevi Yojana wherein women below poverty line can go to empanelled private nursing homes at the government's cost. A survey in Surat district shows that empanelled private providers are situated in urban areas and most of them take on only safe cases, sending the complicated ones to public hospitals. This defeats the entire purpose of the scheme as complications requiring emergency obstetric care are the major cause of maternal mortality. Also, if only safe cases are treated, the reduction in maternal mortality shown under the scheme is questionable.||AKASH ACHARYA,PAUL MCNAMEE

It then concludes by pointing out the importance of untouchability within the brahmin tradition and attempts to understand the process of supplementation which makes untouchability a positive virtue for the brahmins and a negative fact for the dalits.||SUNDAR SARUKKAI

Now, however, there is an increasing separation of discourses — between those who operate exclusively in English and those who operate in the language of the state alone. The decline of the bilingual intellectual is a product of many factors, among them public policy, elite preference, new patterns of marriage, and economic change.||RAMACHANDRA GUHA

The spread and continuity of indigenous systems of medicines, namely, ayurveda, siddha and unani, have thrown up a lot of concerns as well: how to incorporate these systems into a centralised health infrastructure; their expansion through the pharmaceutical industry for herbal products, massage centres and spas; the relations and negotiations between the practitioners of different coexisting systems of medicine; the position of psychosocial and spiritual dimensions of cure and care in contemporary forms of indigenous systems of medicine and the debate on notions of efficacy in multiple, coherent systems of medicine. All these are worth serious study as they raise fundamental questions not just about ISMS, but about organising healthcare in India.

6/6/2009-12/6/2009||perspectives||40279084||The Secular State and the Geography of Radicalism||The burgeoning scholarship on Islamist radicalisation or terrorism - both popular as well as academic - is mostly alarmist. Too often Islamist radicalisation is understood as an offshoot of some deeply entrenched values or that the culture of Islam is incompatible with modernity. This article argues that Islamist radicalisation should be seen as a political phenomenon and that it cannot be divorced from the practices and the role of the State. It focuses on the Students Islamic Movement of India and argues that its radicalisation, manifest in its call for jihad, is largely a consequence of the failure of the Indian secular State to stop the recurring violence against Muslim minority. This article also examines the premises that underpin the media's portrayal of Islam and Muslims and concludes by raising the issue of vulnerability in writing about Islam and radicalisation.||Irfan Ahmad

The findings suggest the necessity of enlarging our analytical scope with regard to EPZS/SEZS, which are inextricably connected with external employment structures. Further, the study calls for an immediate and comprehensive review of the labour and gender conditions in Indian SEZS where workers are in a disadvantageous position not only against capital but also in comparison with workers in South Korean and Bangladeshi EPZS/SEZS.||Mayumi Murayama,Nobuko Yokota

A majority of the police and medical officers, across ranks, handling the case, were dalits. But they showed a negligent attitude towards their official duties and social indifference to the plight of the Bhotmange family. The Nodal Officers, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, recorded the attitude, particularly of the civil surgeon and the district superintendent of police to be "aloof and indifferent to allowing the crime and subsequent manipulation of evidence".||S M DAHIWALE

Through a number of avenues, sometimes regulatory, sometimes not, though often in the name of risk-sensitivity, sophistication and modernity, the impact of current market prices on behaviour has increased. This increased use of market prices has increased the endogeneity of financial market risks. In the economic up-cycle, price-based measures of asset values rise, price-based measures of risk fall and competition to grow bank profits increases. A critical component of the policy response to crisis should be for bank regulation to act as a countervailing force to the natural decline in measured risks in a boom and the subsequent rise in measured risks in the subsequent collapse.||Avinash Persaud

Why should a reader who is interested in Indian writing in English read Kosambi? What would he find in his writings that he is unlikely to find in the historical writings of his contemporaries? How do his narratives reveal his interests, whose range extended far beyond the narrow specialisation of "Ancient India"? How did Marxism develop and hinder his insights and his writings? These are some questions that the essay tries to answer. It examines Kosambi's work and life together. Many elements of Kosambi's life figure in his historical works, and help in giving material substance to his writings.||NAYANJOT LAHIRI

This paper examines the hypothesis and analyses the role of agriculture in Gujarat. Agricultural production is still fluctuating, resulting is low and fluctuating agricultural incomes. High growth rates in other sectors have not generated commensurate growth in agricultural incomes. Significant constraints on private investment in agriculture exist, creating an efficiency case for public investment. The issue of stagnant agricultural incomes presents an argument for public investment in agriculture on distributive grounds.||ANITA K DIXIT

Instead of decentralising expenditure on health, the centre has taken control of a larger share of resources for the sector, which have not been adequately utilised even for the priority programmes. The irony is that those who deliver care, understand the situation and can plan and budget have no role in decision-making while the decision-makers have no idea of the ground realities.||RAVI DUGGAL

Gandhi did not separate religion from politics. He brought a religious ethic to politics rather than political militancy into religious communities. Meanwhile, Savarkar's Hindutva ideology was narrow and exclusivist in its conflation of janma bhoomi (motherland) and punya bhoomi (holy land). In spite of its pretensions to be nationalist and modern, its militant chauvinism and authoritarian fundamentalism make Savarkar's Hindutva the antithesis of Gandhi's Hinduism. I lindutva defines India as Hindu and wants all Indians to be Hindus. In contrast, Gandhi's Hinduism gives space to all. I his paper argues that the future of our multicultural, pluri religious people can only be even bloodier with the preclusions of Savarkar's Hindutva. Only Gandhi's sarva-dharma-samabhova can possibly be an effective basis for a tolerance on which to premise a just inter-religious peace and harmony.||Rudolf C. Heredia

Preventing a recurrence of such a crisis - which is a quite different exercise to overcoming the present crisis - demands reforms to the financial system. The question discussed in this essay is: What reforms? What needs to change? Preventing a recurrence requires a three-point programme: a reversal of the past policy of encouraging bank mergers and its replacement by a vigorous anti-trust policy directed at the banking sector; a determination to make monetary policy anti-cyclical (aided by the adoption of asset-price indicators); and reform of the regulatory system. There are a large number of reforms that are desirable, but the key ones are addition of macro-prudential regulations to the existing system of purely microeconomic regulation, and the penalisation of maturity mismatches in the financial system.||Arvind Subramanian,John Williamson

During this period, sole reliance on traditional indicators of monetary aggregates or policy rates is not adequate to reflect the stance of monetary policy. This paper develops a monetary policy index by synthesising the extracted signals from the policy documents and quantitative information embedded in key indicators. The MPI SO constructed was used to assess the impact of monetary policy on macroeconomic variables such as interest rates, bank credit, inflation, and output growth during the post-reform period. It was observed that while monetary policy has an instant influence on interest rates, the impact on inflation and output was realised with a lag of around 6 to 18 months.||Amaresh Samantaraya

The relation which defines the new location of labour is one in which the labourer is no longer a source of surplus, rather he/she is an unwanted possessor or occupier of economic resources from which he/she must be divorced to free those resources for use in the circuit of capital. This process of dispossession without proletarianisation or exploitation is referred to as exclusion. The traditional contradiction between wage-labour and capital is overshadowed by the contradiction between capital and a surplus labour force. Class politics - traditionally focused on exploitation of wage-labour - must reinvent itself to address the other great political movement shaping up around the exclusion of labour.||Kalyan Sanyal,Rajesh Bhattacharyya

They pay a certain percentage of their revenue as a licence fee to the government on a quarterly basis and the percentage of revenue to be shared depends on the type of service offered and the area of operation. This article argues that such a differential system of licensing is flawed and leads to cross subsidisation and possible arbitrage. It estimates the impact on individual operators and the government's revenue, in case the government implements a uniform licence fee for all services in each area and also argues for a reduction in the licence fee in line with revenue growth.||RAJKUMAR UPADHYAY

It challenges the orthodox perspective by looking more closely at industrial employment in the region by gender.

Though the two states are better off than the nation as a whole in terms of mean-based estimates of average income, they have pronounced inter-regional disparities, interpersonal inequalities and intra-regional deprivations. Broad-based and inclusion measures are generally higher in poor backward regions and vice versa, implying broad-based backwardness and inclusion in deprivation.

After summarising the earlier paper, the variability of employment protection regimes across Indian states attributable to court judgments, a key factor which other authors have ignored, is described. The earlier literature has also ignored the possibility that firms may adapt to restrictions on labour flexibility via fragmentation and outsourcing of production. Some conclusions of the earlier studies are also undermined by lacunae in the official industrial statistics. The paper concludes by summarising the results of an empirical exercise based on an alternative methodology.||Aditya Bhattacharjea

Based on survey and ethnographic data on such associations across diverse neighbourhoods in Bangalore, this paper reveals the fractured, often contradictory, nature of claims made by different sections of middle class. The category urban "middle class" is too homogeneous to account for the multiple locations, interests, and varied access to power of different sections. Homogenising the middle class produces a "middle class-urban poor" dualism which elides critical factors shaping middle class mobilisation, internal conflicts, and local histories and geographies of development of specific neighbourhoods that are-integrally linked to land values. This mapping of middle class action also contributes to our understanding of the process of structuration of urban spaces as new strategies are deployed to transform Indian cities.||Lalitha Kamath,M.

Women's limited ability to access, own, and control property such as land and housing is one manifestation of gender inequity that has serious implications for women and their families in the context of HIV and AIDS. Property grabbing, dispossession, or eviction of women after their husbands' death or due to their HIV positive status is slowly emerging as a problem in India. However, there are few interventions that have addressed the intersection of property and HIV/AIDS. This study locates women's experiences of property conflicts within the larger context of being HIV affected. It describes a range of organisational responses addressing the interaction between property and HIV and highlights the challenges that need to be addressed to shape a meaningful and comprehensive response.||Hema Swaminathan,Nandita Bhatla,Swati Chakraborty

This note shows that the "loss of monetary independence" argument lacks empirical basis. Convergence between India and the rest of the world, though increasing, is as yet incomplete. A variety of tests shows imperfect financial integration, suggesting the Indian economy to be in the intermediate stage, i e, on the transition to full capital mobility, a feature that allows an eclectic monetaryexchange rate policy combination. With no strict trade-offs between the three policy goals posited under the trilemma, there is, as yet, no compromise on monetary independence that would justify a shift towards a free float.||Renu Kohli

The only way to meet the Right to Education obligation is to rely on low cost private schools as a significant instrument of the government education policy. On the contrary, the proposed RTE bill introduces provisions that would oppose low cost private schools. Therefore, the legislation for RTE needs to be modified and framed with specific provisions for private- public partnerships.||Pankaj S. Jain,Ravindra H. Dholakia

What has driven this growth? The Gujarat government has aggressively pursued an innovative agriculture development programme by liberalising markets, inviting private capital, reinventing agricultural extension, improving roads and other infrastructure. Canal-irrigated South and Central Gujarat should have led Gujarat's agricultural rally. Instead it is dry Saurashtra and Kachchh, and North Gujarat that have been at the forefront. These could not have performed so well but for the improved availability of groundwater for irrigation. Arguably, mass-based water harvesting and farm power reforms have helped energise Gujarat's agriculture.||TUSHAAR SHAH,ASHOK GULATI,HEMANT P,GANGA SHREEDHAR,R C JAIN

It links the movement in wages (and hence poverty) to the fundamental process of sectoral labour flow that underlies economic development. It finds that despite the rapid growth of the non-farm sector, its success in drawing labour from land has been limited. Yet agricultural earnings have increased, demonstrating the pivotal role of agricultural productivity. The stock of the labour force already locked into agriculture is large and the best way to improve living standards would be to boost farm productivity.||Mukesh Eswaran,Ashok Kotwal,Bharat Ramaswami,Wilima Wadhwa

Gains from their development accrue to a large common market though the process affects local lives and environments. The distribution of powers and functions across levels of govemment and the way they play out determine the effectiveness with which various policy goals are met. The need to examine these becomes important given the increased demands from resource-bearing states for a more "fair" distribution of resource rents in buoyant commodity markets, and from local people in resource regions for greater recognition of their rights and compensation for the effects of resource development. This paper examines the federal structure in India in the context of minerals, and suggests ways in which this can be strengthened through expanding the space and institutional capacity for local governance and by improving compensation and the sharing of resource revenues.||Ligia Noronha,Nidhi Srivastava,Divya Datt,P.

An analysis of data from the post-poll survey of the NES 2009 and its comparison with category-wise figures for the 2004 Lok Sabha poll, in particular, and some earlier ones, in general, reveal that there were no dramatic changes in the participation scenario of the latest election.

This paper makes a comparative assessment of the development of the higher education system in the two countries, the challenges being faced and what the future holds for both countries. China has made considerable progress with its top institutions and India has illustrated with the Indian Institutes of Technology and a few other institutions that high standards are possible. Yet, the problem of quality, and the related issues of whether the graduates are qualified for the labour market, remain. It seems that China and India will, at the least, not see significant reform in the overall academic quality of higher education. An effective quality-assurance system can help to ensure standards, but neither country has such a system in place currently capable of overall supervision.

It elucidates, first how SAARC has bridged its institutional endowment-deficit as an apolitical organisation with the complex reality of the region - that is, the many ways regional cooperation has tackled political issues in the subcontinent. One of the hypotheses developed here is that either occurring on the side or even in opposition to the association's formal workings, the informal and quasi-official political dimension of the organisation is in fact essential to its functioning. A second one is that beyond serving as a political platform for traditional diplomacy, it is offering south Asian leaders and people a new understanding of the region and its politics. Finally, this paper argues that on the basis of sound empirical evidence and the shortcomings of the theoretical frameworks embraced to date, SAARC cannot be dismissed as being only an "empty forum".||Francesco Obino

But a political declaration with a framework for a future global deal that is more likely to emerge from the summit would be no less important, for such a declaration will draw the contours of an agreement on climate change and cover many issues of importance for the developing countries — the future of the Kyoto Protocol, common and differentiated responsibilities of rich and poor countries and an agenda for the "advanced developing countries".

However, a contemporary politics of location must be articulated from a "postnational" standpoint that opposes the essentialisms of yesterday without being indifferent to place. Locations matter not because some places are superior or inferior to others but because places differ. These differences do not need to be celebrated, museumised or protected from contamination, but they must be allowed to survive. If social theory is partly shaped by its contexts, then "we" - no matter who we are or where we are located - are better off with a multiplicity of such contexts.||Satish Deshpande

Consequently, the earlier emphasis on women's education and socio economic conditions as determinants of fertility decline is shifting to research on the study of reciprocally initiated positive contributions of fertility decline to the improvement of the health of women and children. This analysis indicates that illiterate women and their children are the greatest recipients of the benefits of health and socio-economic advancement. The standardised percentages of women without education who received three antenatal care check-ups and whose children received full immunisation are sharply higher for women with two children and less than for those with more than two children. Child mortality reductions for women of lower parities are steeply higher for uneducated women compared with educated women. These cumulative benefits of low fertility, in effect, have speeded up the health improvement and socio-economic advancement of the states.||P. Arokiasamy

The process of creating "unfettered" access to historical information can be seen as the prying open of information that was otherwise accessible only to a "privileged" community. This is a tension that is central to the very idea of the public sphere: it can act simultaneously both as a Utopia of "bourgeois" equality and as an ideology of domination. It can be simultaneously democratic and undemocratic. The agents and advocates of the public sphere are often the bearers of this tension for we never find a society where all its members, inspired by the social value of what we call "history", volunteer to convert willingly all "private" documents into "public" records. The rendering of private papers into public documents must remain, in the end, a political question. This paper illustrates this proposition by looking at a fragment of the history of history in colonial India in the 20th century. At the centre of the story is the historian Jadunath Sarkar who may be regarded as one of the earliest proponents in the subcontinent of the Rankean ideals of "scientific" history.||Dipesh Chakrabarty

In turn, this needs knowledge of institutions and of their relations. The first stage that is needed to explain the retarded development of apparently appropriate solar energy technology in India is developed; and the implications for technology theory, analysis and policy are outlined. India's technology system was created precociously early to facilitate research and development. Technology is available. It is not obstructed by intellectual property rights so much as by the structure of domestic energy subsidies and support measures, the risk aversion of banks and the coordination failures of the system of market- and state-institutions for renewable energy technology. As a result, the state is seriously hampered from acting in the long-term public interest. In general, policy reform may require institutional destruction as well as creation, adaptation and persistence.||BARBARA HARRISS-WHITE,SUNALI ROHRA,NIGEL SINGH

Blaming offshore financial centres or the complexity of derivatives for the current problems misses the point. This article proposes counter-cyclical capital charges to push banks to develop incentive packages that are more encouraging of longer-term behaviour and a valuation method based on the relative maturity of an intermediary's funding. What the latter will do is allow any institution in a liquidity crisis to set up its own internal "bad bank" mechanism so long as it has sufficient long-term funding to support it.||Avinash D.

Where there is repeated interaction, the members are able to get better information about the activities and intentions of other members in the community than outsiders, thereby promoting collective action or community participation supported by peer monitoring and social sanctions. In order to verify the logic of community participation, three sessions of a public goods classroom experiment were conducted with students and villagers at Kolkata and South 24 Parganas in West Bengal. The results show that even though the group contributions have in all cases been above 50% of the initial endowment, the contributions by the villagers who were members of the same community-based organisation were always higher than those by the students. This may be attributed to the fact that the villagers, being members of the same CBO have a common history of social interaction leading to better group cohesiveness.||Santanu Mitra,Gautam Gupta

The tragedy invited a Supreme Court suo motu intervention against local healing shrines all over the country that also included reform of the mental health system in general. This set of medico-legal events has led to the exclusive targeting of local healing shrines by various statutory agencies evoking human rights, ignoring the primary intent of the court that was reform of the mental health system in general. Against this context, we are presenting case studies of dargahs in Maharashtra which serve the purpose of healing from psychosocial traumas and argue for a more deliberate response to the vexed question of mental healing and overall health.||Bhargavi V.

Consistent with similar studies based on national-level data sets, the findings from this study show that the share of public goods expenditures in total government spending has a large, positive and significant impact on per capita GDP growth, and that the share of spending on social public goods such as education and health contributes significantly to poverty reduction. Especially, reallocation of expenditures to raise the share of public goods spending could on average increase per capita GDP growth rate by up to 2.7 percentage points, and reallocation of funds to increase the share of social public goods expenditures could on average reduce poverty headcount index by up to 6.6 percentage points.||HOUQI HONG,SADIQ AHMED

A class analysis of household-level farm production data from two states reveals the pattern of income depression and rising indebtedness in rural areas. The deleterious implications these processes have for future agrarian development call for effective price stabilisation operations and a comprehensive debt-relief policy in the short run.||Arindam Banerjee

In view of the growing divergence both between and within the states, disaggregated studies are necessary for accurate identification of the critical areas calling for policy intervention. In the National Sample Survey Organisation's Consumer Expenditure Survey held in 2004-05, the sample design had taken districts as strata in both the rural and urban sectors, which makes it possible to get unbiased estimates of parameters at the district level. This paper presents a profile of levels of living, poverty and inequality for all the districts of the 20 major states of India.

In the past few years, there have been marked shifts in the size, focus and strategic thinking behind India's foreign aid programme. As an emerging donor on the world stage, India needs to align its aid strategy not with its ambitions but with a realistic assessment of its strengths and historical roots.

Ambedkar offered a multilayered, counter-hegemonic reading of caste that was lost on at least three generations of sociologists and possibly accounts for several of the conservative trends we have seen in the social sciences in institutions of higher learning. What is particularly interesting is the silence in the field of sociological work for at least five decades after Ambedkar's contribution to the sociology of caste.||Kalpana Kannabiran

If Islamic fundamentalism is the aggrieved prey and a reaction to a brazen capitalist system represented by neoliberalism, Hindu fundamentalism, represented by Hindutva, is an effervescent by-product of the same order. The weaknesses of alternate movements against capitalism and their inability to achieve a more equitable and fair order have seen the continuation of a system that has only furthered decadence and strife. That is notwithstanding the message of triumphalism and trumpeting of the western conception of multiculturalism by those who defend the order.||Sanjeev H. M. Kumar

Madhusudan had, till 1940, been feted by middle class Bengalis across the spectrum as a legendary poet. However, the brilliant aura around him began to be muddied by critics whose modernist provenance was an even more powerful impulse than the Marxist. This paper recontextualises strategies of reading and representation, which change historically in response to evolving and shifting cultural paradigms. It shows how readings of a particular writer or a period are orchestrated through a multiplicity of exchanges in politically charged situations. It neither redeems Madhusudan nor resurrects the idea of the Bengal Renaissance.||ROSINKA CHAUDHURI

A field study conducted to detail the wages, conditions of workers, employment security, social security, gender bias, etc, in mango jelly and pickle making in the unorganised segment and fish processing and cashew processing in the factory sector in Andhra Pradesh brings out several problems in the quality of employment. The average wage of these workers is only 48% of the statutory minimum. Women, who are the major victims, working under poor conditions without any social security, earn only half of what their male counterparts do. Meanwhile, it is also found out that some of the food processing jobs are denied to the scheduled castes, which suggests discrimination on the basis of caste.||N. Chandrasekhara Rao,Sukti Dasgupta

Among the reasons for this dismal state are constraints of ideology, politics, state paranoia and lack of infrastructure.

In the past, what is now Pakistan was closer to, and more part of, the larger south Asian or "Indian subcontinental" identity, but it has now "corrected its direction" (apna qibla durust kar liya hai). In some ways, the Pakistani identities of the Muslim and the south Asian/Indian are competing identities, often mutually exclusive. A secular India with a Muslim minority would not wish for a stronger Muslim south Asian identity while a Muslim Pakistan may not want to belong to an idea or union, in which it would be marginalised and subservient to a power which it sees as its nemesis.||S.

The new delimitation gave the Congress an opportunity to redraw the lines and break out of the corner that it had been boxed into by its coalition partners. Further, unlike 2004, all parties hedged their bets, waiting for post-election negotiations, and both the major groupings announced no common programme. Another notable feature was the high proportion of seats in which a split in votes by a third candidate decided the winner. Added to the prominent role played by many state and regional parties, all this seems to indicate that coalition politics is here to stay.||K K KAILASH

It is also clear that the US remains firmly committed to ensuring that its hegemonic interests are not seriously compromised by the outcome of climate change negotiations. With the climate laggards in tow, and a pliant European Union unwilling to assert its better instincts, there is a serious danger that the US would dominate the endgame at Copenhagen with an outcome that substantially meets its requirements, at the cost of the developing countries. Above all, a US-led outcome would spell an end, at least temporarily, to serious emissions cuts by the developed countries.||T JAYARAMAN

That 88% of SC/ST members of panchayats were elected from reserved seats confirms that policy has been crucial to the representation of disadvantaged groups. An analysis shows that a majority of women representatives could not get re-elected because their seats were de-reserved in the next election. Reservation motivated 43% of women representatives to contest their first election and its withdrawal dissuaded 39% from seeking re-election. This points to the need to rethink the system of rotating seats reserved for women so that they are given 10 to 15 years of continued opportunity.||Nupur Tiwari

The examination of employment patterns at various levels leads to conclusive evidence that distress-induced push factors have been predominant in driving workers to non-farm employment. The paper also records the link with rural non-farm employment, of various factors such as landownership, education and caste affiliation. Low levels of education and their status as landless earners devoid of capital resources suggest broad distress-induced circumstances of non-farm workers.||Sharad Ranjan

Paradoxically, this employment growth occurred during a period of widespread distress in the agricultural sector with low productivity, price instability and stagnation leading to indebtedness. This paper reveals that employment growth in the rural areas was probably a response to the income crisis that is gripping farming. Under conditions of distress, when income levels fall below sustenance, then the normally non-working population is forced to enter the labour market to supplement household income. The decline of the agricultural sector has also probably created forced sectoral and regional mobility of the working population, with the non-working population complementing them.||Vinoj Abraham

This long run integration, however, does not come from the free flow of goods across states in the country, but from the sharing of similar production technologies by farmers across states. The paper also shows that the market for wheat is not integrated in the short run. This implies that at a given time period there exist two prices for the same commodity, since transaction costs are the main barriers to market integration. The paper also estimates such transaction costs using transport and communication infrastructure indices across states, and concludes that there exist large variations resulting in high transaction costs.||Megha Mukim,Karan Singh,A.

In India, in many cases, especially relating to tribal communities that have been relatively isolated from the outside world, the displacement is traumatic from both economic and cultural points of view. This paper provides brief case studies of displacement (past, ongoing, or proposed) from protected areas, number of villages/families displaced, the place where these villages/families were relocated to, governance of the relocation process, and the kind or nature of relocation (voluntary, induced or forced). It finds that not even a single study shows the ecological costs and benefits of relocation, comparing what happens at the old site to what happens as the rehabilitation site. This is a shocking gap, given that relocation is always justified from the point of view of reducing pressures and securing wildlife habitats.||ANTOINE LASGORCEIX,ASHISH KOTHARI

Drawing on the comparative politics literature and using electoral data from 1977 to 2005, this paper analyses the performance of ruling parties in national and state elections in India. The findings are that incumbent members of Parliament from national ruling parties and legislative assembly members from state ruling parties are less likely to win than incumbents from the opposition when they come up for re-election. The paper also measures the "honeymoon period" effect, namely, the advantage that candidates from the state ruling party enjoy in national elections that are held early in the state government's term and candidates from the national ruling party enjoy in state elections. India's patronage-based democratic system and federal structure creates incentives for voters to favour the same party for national and state office and coordinate their votes. However, the honeymoon period is short-lived, and the positive effect turns into a negative penalty within two years of a party's term in office.||Nirmala Ravishankar

So far, the liberalisation policies have induced foreign providers to focus only on certain technical and professional fields of study that can earn them good market returns. In contrast to these modes, it is better to design a strategy that taps foreign universities and institutes of acceptable quality to work together with Indian universities/institutes to improve both access and quality.

Voters privileged the performance of the state government rather than that in the centre while choosing their representative from Mizoram.||LALLIAN CHHUNGA

25/4/2009-1/5/2009||commentary||40279175||Global Downturn and the Thirteenth Finance Commission||In the current uncertain fiscal situation following the global downturn, the Thirteenth Finance Commission is constrained in making a realistic assessment of the resources and expenditure needs of the centre and the states. Past experience clearly indicates that in a fiscal crisis resource transfers to states will witness a contraction and it would be unfair to bind the states to such a dispensation for five years. In view of the current uncertainties, the THFC should be asked to give its recommendations for two instead of five years. Such a course of action will also result in the synchronisation of the term of the Finance Commission and the period of the five-year plans, and will help address the uncertainty arising from the proposed introduction of Goods and Services Tax from 2010.||G.

The latter traces the ranking of districts overtime. Though this does not conclusively prove what the main determining factors for the movement of inequality are, a rank correlation analysis of per capita incomes with their physical and social infrastructure ranks gives sufficient hints about the causal relations between the two.||Ajitava Raychaudhuri,Sushil K.

10/10/2009-23/10/2009||notes||25663682||Mapping Indian Districts across Census Years, 1971-2001||In India, for many empirical questions, states have been the standard unit of analysis and they are a natural starting point for research using official data sources because state governments set political agendas and budgets and administer a wide range of services. The use of more disaggregated district data allows the study of outcomes across regions with similar historical contexts and political regimes. Most district-level studies, however, have relied on cross-sectional analysis because district comparisons over time are complicated by multiple boundary changes. As providing information on boundary changes across districts will facilitate the construction of district-level panel data sets, this article provides data on the composition of all Indian districts over the 1971-2001 period that can enable the construction of district panels.||HEMANSHU KUMAR,ROHINI SOMANATHAN

I argue that dalit women also face patriarchal oppression, though it has a specific quality. Under such circumstances, who is a dalit woman's ally? The essay focuses on the penumbra of debilitating circumstances, which call for a further understanding of the particular context of dalit femininity and oppressed sexuality.||SHAILAJA PAIK

It traces the three phases of reforms the region has passed through, attaining a spectacular rise in gross domestic product and household incomes. But later developments have negated some of the achievements of the earlier stages of reform. It proposes that the authorities initiate genuine grass roots democracy so that local people will have the power to decide on matters that affect them.||Manoranjan Mohanty

Price adjustment models are developed based on industrial organisation literature and are examined with 28 manufacturing industries at the 3-digit level over the period from 1963 to 2001. Domestic structural factors are found to be important in determining the speed of price adjustment.||Mita Bhattacharya,Michael Olive

But the initial impression of an overwhelming mandate for the Congress needs to be corrected. A close scrutiny of the outcome shows that the Congress "victory" was ambiguous and owed a lot to movements that were not of its making. Shifts in the "third electoral system" worked against the politics of identity and made the quality of government an issue. The Bharatiya Janata Party's inability to hold on to its new social bloc resulted in a depolarisation that benefited the Congress. The victory of the Congress also came about because the voters had a mildly positive image of its governance record and welfare measures. Yet in the end this verdict was more about politics than chance. A shrinking of the National Democratic Alliance, a positive image of the UPA government and its leadership gave the ruling coalition a decisive lead before the campaign formally began.||YOGENDRA YADAV,SUHAS PALSHIKAR

It is a blend of cosmological and historical time, which strongly resists the full-fledged secularising tendencies within historical interpretations. This essay revisits Gandhi's Hind Swaraj, which depicts a "clash of civilisations" between values and since it deals with normative systems it maps the political terrain differently. The attempt here is to reinterpret Gandhi in the time of modernity.||MAHESH GAVASKAR

Differential access to languages, especially to English, distinguishes the "national" and regional elites in India. This article presents evidence relating to language choice from the civil services exams post-1979. The perceptible changes in preferences of candidates taking this exam reflect a new confidence with using Indian languages led by Hindi and mirror the larger changes in the linguistic landscape and in linguistic relations.||MARUTHI P TANGIRALA

The leaked contents of an extraordinary communication from Minister of State for Environment and Forests Jairam Ramesh to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh indicate that the new thinking is only a thinly veiled proposal to barter India's energy and developmental future for an illusory superpower status that would contribute little to the nation and its people. The focus on the new thinking is on the accommodation of developed nations' interests on climate change rather than finding means to force them to live up to their commitments.||T JAYARAMAN

The silver lining is that the crisis has discredited many established ideas about how societies should run their economies, and the impact of this discrediting will last well beyond the recovery. The crisis provides opportunities for advancing a social democratic vision of a moral society, with more of a balance between economic democracy and political democracy, especially in finance; one in which states regain confidence to surveil markets, as in the Keynesian era. A three-stage programme to steer out of the crisis towards something better and very different from what has been followed under neoliberalism is set out. The first deals with the immediate crisis. The second with the restructuring of finance. The third – to which virtually no attention has yet been given – deals with respecialisinn western economies. Getting far with most of the items would require a step-up in multilateral cooperation.||Robert Wade

In the savage war for "development" in Bastar, the wrath of the people is reserved for the state, which for decades treated them as less than human and is now busy promoting rapacious capitalism.||GAUTAM NAVLAKHA,ASISH GUPTA
