16/5/2009-22/5/2009||commentary||40279005||National Biodiversity Action Plan||Over the last few years the Ministry of Environment and Forests has become a rubber stamp for the most destructive and unsustainable process of "development" unleashed in India. Several environmental regulations have been systematically re- engineered to fall in line with the status quo of the great green coverup. The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan was just another victim of this process, dumped because it recommended uncomfortable steps necessary to reorient the economy and polity towards greater sustainability, accountability and democracy.||Ashish Kothari,Kanchi Kohli
14/3/2009-20/3/2009||special articles||40278614||Nature Lovers, Picnickers and Bourgeois Environmentalism||India's middle class visitors to the country's wildlife sanctuaries and protected areas are ignored in policy formulation as well as academic analyses of wildlife conservation. Traditionally, the conservation discourse has focused on the face-off between elite conservation institutions and the marginalised social groups, with domestic tourists being overlooked. At best, the latter are looked upon by the scientific-administrative elite as frivolous picnickers. But this neglect of an everincreasing constituency is an opportunity lost to gain its support for conservation policies and practices. It also means that the considerable investment and planning needed to promote environmental education as part of a visit to a protected area is missing.||Emma Mawdsley,Deepshikha Mehra,Kim Beazley

They prefer targets based on reductions in total emissions by developing countries, comparable or equivalent to those undertaken by them. This paper offers a new approach that tries to bolster the case for a per capita emissions approach by distinguishing the CO₂ emissions intensity of production and consumption from energy use per capita. It also outlines some projections that could lead to a reasonable emissions trajectory for India and one that is consistent with global efforts at addressing climate change. Looking at the role of trade in climate change, it concludes that the outcome will be messy if the trading system is burdened with the task of settling environmental problems.||ARVIND SUBRAMANIAN,NANCY BIRDSALL,AADITYA MATTOO
23/5/2009-29/5/2009||notes||40279037||Traditional Knowledge and Conservation||The Soliga tribe in the Biligiri Rangaswamy Temple Hills of Chamarajanagar district of Karnataka has maintained a continuous and intimate interaction with the forest, deriving most of its basic requirements from the forests. The Soligas used to engage in shifting cultivation and collection of non-timber forest produce which was harvested in an indigenous and sustainable method until the BRT area was declared a wildlife sanctuary. This paper studies the indigenous traditional knowledge of the Soliga tribe about ecology forest conservation and resource management systems. It also describes tribal clan structures, practices of harvesting and conservation and the scope for developing a conservation regime that incorporates these aspects in forest management.||C.

Hydro-diplomacy in the Ganges-Brahmaputra-Meghna basin is still based on reductionist engineering, and looks at marginal economic benefits, without showing any concern for the long-run implications for livelihoods and ecosystem. The governments in the river basin are already facing the challenge of extreme poverty, despite the countries experiencing high levels of precipitation. This paper discusses the lacunae of the reductionist engineering paradigm, and stresses the need for a holistic framework in ecological engineering and for hydro-diplomacy in the basin. This framework is based on a new transdisciplinary knowledge base created by the emerging science of eco-hydrology, economics, and new institutional theories.||JAYANTA BANDYOPADHYAY,NILANJAN GHOSH
21/2/2009-27/2/2009||special articles||40278527||Passages from Nature to Nationalism: Sunderlal Bahuguna and Tehri Dam Opposition in Garhwal||This paper focuses on the shifting contours of the anti-Tehri dam movement in the pastthree decades. It examines the changing declarations of environmentalists, especially Sunderlal Bahuguna and other leaders of the movement on the one hand, and the involvement of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad in the anti-dam politics on the other. Exploring the evocations of nature, religion and nation in different phases by these two groups of actors, it argues that through a regular use of certain mythical beliefs and simplified dichotomies, there was an inadvertent collaboration between green and saffron. The Tehri dam became a means of combining sacredness with impulse, gravity of high politics with solemnity of daily worship, and nature with nationalism.||Mukul Sharma

Far from remaining faithful to the motives that resulted in the institution of public interest litigation, the Supreme Court has tended to act against the interests of the socio- economically backward.||Prashant Bhushan

This paper looks at the nature of commercialised biotech products, the changing locus of agricultural research, the emerging market failures in biotech product development, and the likely impact on poverty and employment. The evidence shows that Bt cotton is scale neutral and profitable to all groups of farmers. But research in biotechnology is mainly in the hands of a few large multinational companies which focus on crops and traits that are significant to the developed countries and not the resource-poor farmers. The public sector, therefore, must step in to pursue basic research that will benefit the poorer farmers.||N CHANDRASEKHARA RAO,S MAHENDRA DEV

However, as an analysis of the act's implementation in Andhra Pradesh shows, it has turned into a bureaucratic exercise instead of an empowerment tool. The ingrained patriarchal view of the State and its reluctance to grant the claimants — men and women — community rights to the land they were tilling all these years reveal that the profit motive and integration into larger global capital markets drive its forest development programmes. In the process, the women are becoming wage labourers carrying out the government's programmes of plantation rather than exercising their traditional knowledge to nurture forests and gain rightful livelihoods.||SAGARI R RAMDAS

Sustainable alternatives need to incorporate an understanding that non-industrial lifestyles and non-human life forms too deserve respect and space to flourish. This short piece offers a sympathetic critique of the Amit Bhaduri-Medha Patkar economic formula (3 January 2009).||Ashish Kothari

Not only will this be calamitous for nature and the communities living at the project sites, it will also lead to delays as the affected people challenge such clearances in courts of law. The better course would be to strengthen the environmental clearance process and make it transparent.||Manju Menon,Kanchi Kohli

The public hearing on the environmental clearance in May was a farcical exercise with company employees and their families crowding out the affected villagers. The venue was surrounded by armed and baton-wielding police and the Central Industrial Security Force, creating a repressive atmosphere.||MOUSHUMI BASU
15/8/2009-21/8/2009||special articles||25663446||Urban Transport Policy as if People and the Environment Mattered: Pedestrian Accessibility the First Step||The rapid growth in motor vehicle ownership and activity in India is causing a wide range of serious health, environmental, socio-economic, and resource use impacts, even as it provides mobility to millions, and contributes to employment and the economy. The loss of accessibility for pedestrians is one of the most important of these negative impacts, which remains neglected by policy. Urban transport planning is fundamentally about moral and political choices — about what kind of cities we want for ourselves and our future generations, whether urban space is primarily for people or motor vehicles, and what we owe each other. While motor vehicles play a vitally important role, as do planning and infrastructure for them, and technological measures to mitigate their impacts, an urban transport policy that focuses on these measures to the exclusion of infrastructure for walking and other non-motorised modes is likely to prove futile, even counter-productive. There is, therefore, an urgent need for an integrated approach that addresses multiple impacts, caters to multiple modes and road users, and is sensitive to the needs, capabilities and constraints in the Indian context.||MADHAV G BADAMI

This is primarily because of the faulty composition of the NEAA, alongside the non-appointment of the chairperson and vice-chairperson. The future of the NEAA looks bleak and its usefulness as a quasi-judicial authority must be in doubt.||ARMIN ROSENCRANZ,GEETANJOY SAHU,VYOM RAGHUVANSHI

If they are to be effective, these green tribunals must insure the costs of bringing properly evidenced litigation, enable all affected people to bring challenges, avoid delay, ensure the objectivity of tribunal members, and guarantee the enforcement of tribunal orders.||ARMIN ROSENCRANZ,GEETANJOY SAHU

The government should learn from the past experience of such coal-based power plants, reassess the true demands for energy and encourage ecologically sustainable planning, which will also benefit the local people. Such alternatives are already available and have been demonstrated to be workable but is the government listening?||K. J. Joy,Suhas Paranjape,Anant R. Phadke
21/2/2009-27/2/2009||special articles||40278529||Resource Federalism in India: The Case of Minerals||While natural resources are spatially located, their development is of a wider national interest. Gains from their development accrue to a large common market though the process affects local lives and environments. The distribution of powers and functions across levels of govemment and the way they play out determine the effectiveness with which various policy goals are met. The need to examine these becomes important given the increased demands from resource-bearing states for a more "fair" distribution of resource rents in buoyant commodity markets, and from local people in resource regions for greater recognition of their rights and compensation for the effects of resource development. This paper examines the federal structure in India in the context of minerals, and suggests ways in which this can be strengthened through expanding the space and institutional capacity for local governance and by improving compensation and the sharing of resource revenues.||Ligia Noronha,Nidhi Srivastava,Divya Datt,P.

In India, in many cases, especially relating to tribal communities that have been relatively isolated from the outside world, the displacement is traumatic from both economic and cultural points of view. This paper provides brief case studies of displacement (past, ongoing, or proposed) from protected areas, number of villages/families displaced, the place where these villages/families were relocated to, governance of the relocation process, and the kind or nature of relocation (voluntary, induced or forced). It finds that not even a single study shows the ecological costs and benefits of relocation, comparing what happens at the old site to what happens as the rehabilitation site. This is a shocking gap, given that relocation is always justified from the point of view of reducing pressures and securing wildlife habitats.||ANTOINE LASGORCEIX,ASHISH KOTHARI

It traces the three phases of reforms the region has passed through, attaining a spectacular rise in gross domestic product and household incomes. But later developments have negated some of the achievements of the earlier stages of reform. It proposes that the authorities initiate genuine grass roots democracy so that local people will have the power to decide on matters that affect them.||Manoranjan Mohanty
