The sustained uptrend in prices since 1956-57 was thus resumed after a short break in 1968-69. An important assumption of the Fourth Five-Year Plan being stability of prices, the Plan's calculations would go awry unless this uptrend is checked. This paper seeks to analyse the factors that were responsible for the price situation. What emerges as evident is that, in analysing a price trend, one has to look for the trend in income velocity in addition to the trend in monetary resources. Very often, a fall in income velocity has moderated the inflationary impact of a rise in monetary resources, and vice versa. Another revealing fact is that, even a marginal fall in agricultural production or in availability of foodgrains results in a noticeable rise in prices, A good crop year has been generally followed by a decline in income velocity - probably because the money flows then to the agricultural sector which does not spend it so rapidly as do the other sectors.||S.

Indeed, the will to act upon these 'resolves' has been so weak that one begins to doubt their sincerity. This tendency was once again in evidence at the Tenali Seminar on 'The Directive Principles of State Policy vis-a-vis State Action with reference to Weaker Sections' organised by V S R College from January 7 through January 10, 1970. The main object of the Seminar was to highlight the problems of the weaker sections - women, Scheduled Castes and Tribes, other Backward Classes and the suppressed sections of thereligious minorities - and to evolve action-oriented programmes to improve their living conditions and to bring them at par with the advanced sections. The Seminar was to examine the extent to which state action is informed by the directive principles and to suggestmeasures for their active involvement in the democratic process at all levels. Further the Seminar was also expected to examine to what extent the graded inequality of the Hindu social organisation was coming in the way of enforcing social justice and to suggest programmes for the emergence of a casteless society.||H.

Policy-makers can then decide where to concentrate the possible agricultural development works, considering the goals in view It is necessary, therefore, to formulate a measure for gauging agricultural productivity. Several suggestions have been made on the definition of agricultural productivity. The following article considers these, and recommends the crop yield index as the most useful measure.||S. B.

There exist fragmentary bits of information from different sources which have varying reliability. They are certainly not sufficient to clinch any definite conclusion, but they are suggestive. This paper is an attempt to collate these bits of information and to glean from them whatever rough generalisations they may possibly indicate. The broad conclusions that emerge seem to question the current official view that the only feasible as well as the surest way of improving the economic condition of the weaker sections of the rural population is to encourage faster agricultural growth through subsidisation of the chemical-biological breakthrough in production and through promotion of agrarian capitalism in the countryside. At the end of the 1960s, as the green revolutionaries are waving their certificates of good performance given by the World Bank and other august institutions, more than 70 per cent of the rural population (about 300 million) are below even the barest minimum acceptable level of living. This percentage has apparently doubled in the sixties in rural India as a whole as well as in Bihar, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, Mysore and UP. In Punjab (including Haryana)-the throbbing heart-land of the 'Green Revolution'-the percentage of the rural population below the minimum level of living nearly quadrupled between 1960-61 and 1967-68; the same is true of Assam and West Bengal. In all States the percentage has gone up significantly. [Kalpana Bardhan and T N Srinivasan suggested improvements on an earlier draft.

The tendency for more rapid growth in the developed areas was particularly marked in the industrial sector. The planners, while rejecting location of large industrial projects on regional development considerations, had visualised that the handicaps of backward areas would be removed through expansion of social services and infrastructure facilities and development of agriculture. Analysis of State plan expenditures does not, however, show higher expenditure on these in the backward States. The reason for this must be sought partly in the area of policy and partly in that of formulation and implementation of programmes. Proof of indifference to regional development is to be found in the failure to define backwardness and delineate backward areas or even to assemble adequate data on regional growth rates. Industrial licensing has not been used as an instrument of dispersal of industries nor have public sector programmes been formulated specifically to stimulate development away from the large cities. Even the industrial estates programme has not been used for this purpose.||V. Nath

The following article examines the validity of the assumptions that underlie this emphasis and evaluates, with discouraging results, the effectiveness of management training.

26/9/1970- ||review of agriculture, september 1970||4360514||Is Inadequacy of Institutional Credit a Problem in Changing Agriculture?||An earlier study had indicated that farmers tend to substitute commercial bank credit for their own funds and/or for other sources of finance, and that this substitution has no significant impact on farm production. This article is therefore based on the connected question: "Is inadequacy of the existing institutional credit facilities a problem in changing agriculture?". The question is important because of the widespread notion that inadequacy of credit is a serious bottleneck in the adoption of the new technology. The second study indicates that the existing availability of working capital, including credit, with the sample farmers is not inadequate to meet the requirements of technological changes in agriculture. There does, however, exist significant scope for the reallocation of existing credit facilities, Withdrawal of institutional credit from farmers who have adequate owned resources and its provision to the 'needy' farmers would greatly increase efficiency of credit use. In fact, credit management involves proper scrutiny of individual loans and an emphasis by credit suppliers on their own developmental role. With a proper understanding of the developmental role and efficient allocation of credit, much could be achieved even with the existing resources of institutional finance.||B. M. Desai,D. K. Desai

Certain average characteristics of largescale farming in Punjab were presented in these two articles. However, the purpose of the survey was to study not just large-scale farming but capitalist farming, if such a category could be scientifically defined and identified empirically. An attempt is made here to pick out farmers having certain characteristics and to study the possible explanatory factors going with them.

1/1/1970- ||future of aid||4359556||Debt Repayment by Developing Countries||While the overall debt-service picture of developing countries is somewhat dismal, countries with 'critical' debt-service burdens, such as Brazil, Argentina, Indonesia, Mexico, Tunisia, India, Pakistan, UAR and Yugoslavia, are few. However, among them are some of the more important of the less developed countries. Among them also are some of the more industrialised countries. Several of these countries - in particular, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and India - have been following an inward-oriented developmental strategy. In part, their service problems can be attributed to this pattern of development. It should not be impossible for these countries to shift some of the emphasis from import-competing industries to export industries. The developed countries should help in this adjustment through less restrictive import policies. In addition, improvement in terms of aid has to constitute an important part of any effort to make the repayment problem more manageable. Recent trends of liberalisation are welcome, but grossly inadequate. If the concept of developmental assistance is to have content, such assistance must be provided at least on the terms recommended by the Pearson Commission - i e, at an interest of not more than two per cent, with a maturity of 25 to 40 years, and a grace period of seven to ten years. Unless the terms improve along these lines the repayment problem could become explosive in the very near future.||G. C. da Costa

For, while the disposable income after tax of a taxpayer increases with the exemption and the effective rate of tax on his income gets reduced, the expectation is that the relief will induce the tax-payer to increase savings in the specified forms and will thereby increase the level and flow of personal savings in the economy. This article aims to examine the evolution of legislative provisions pertaining to tax rebate in India, to analyse data available in this regard, and then to evaluate the success of the present policy of tax rebate.||N.

Unless the Court uses this opportunity with restraint and imagination, the Constitution and the democratic system would be exposed to needless strain. The impression should not be created that the right to private property guaranteed in the Constitution will come in the way of implementation of socio-economic reforms. Such an impression will only help those who believe that a social order based on justice cannot be created under a democratic Constitution. The Supreme Court must, of course, step in where the legislature acts arbitrarily or unconstitutionally. Also, the right to private property is an important aspect of the economic and political systems that we have given ourselves. At the same time, the competing demands of social justice must be given adequate attention.||S. P. Sathe

Whether this seems for better or worse depends on one's value preferences. One of the things clearly visible is that the era of single party dominance is over. At the same time, the forebodings of some scholars notwithstanding, the political system has survived. In spite of differences of ideologies, relative organisational strengths, and past experiences, all parties seem to have accepted the need for coalition governments at different levels as an alternative to the pre-1967 set-up. With the split in Congress, the two Congress parties have become rival foci of power, the one or other of which the remaining parties are preparing to join to form coalition governments at the Centre and in the States. Much experience has been already gained in the working of coalition governments and this should provide the guidelines for the operation of coalition politics in the seventies. This paper attempts an analysis of the possible nature of coalitions and the likely directions in which the party system will move in the coming decade.||B. L. Maheshwari

29/8/1970- ||review of management, august 1970||4360392||Economic Forecasting in India||The planning system has created widespread interest in annual economic forecasting which has now become something of a pastime among economists and research organisations. However, given the data gaps in the economy, these attempts at forecasting remain pioneering efforts. The main areas to which attention needs to be directed are estimates of levels of investment, factors governing demand for manufactures and discontinuities, if any, in trends in tertiary income. The greatest ignorance perhaps prevails in respect of flows of income and timing of income generation. In countries where the secondary and tertiary sectors account for the predominant part of national income, it is natural to assume that income flows are regular over the year. Obviously, the assumption is not valid for countries like India. Knowledge of regional flows of income and goods is, similarly, lacking. Before economic forecasting can be made more sophisticated, much research needs to be done on various subsectors of the economy and income-flows between them.||Phiroze B. Medhora
30/5/1970- ||special articles||4360056||Monopoly and Public Policy||Recent public discussions on the problem of monopoly rest largely on the naive and unproven assumption that both monopoly and monopoly capitalism are undesirable both from the point of view of growth and from that of other social objectives. There is no analytic assessment of the objective situation which has lead to these phenomena nor is there any objective interpretation of their role in such industrial development as has occurred so far. It is argued in section I of this paper that pure monopoly as defined in the text-books is a rare phenomenon and that in a large number of cases short-run monopolistic practices and gains reflect the operation of the competitive principle and represent, in fact, the most powerful engine of growth. To found a family industrial empire is a powerful motivating factor for economic development and, given the distribution of entrepreneurial talent at a given place and time and the objective economic environment and policies, it is natural to expect a few family empires at the top of the economic structure; but it is not often realised that the composition of these families change over a period of time (section II). It is true, however, that the planning process and related policies restrict the operation of the competitive principle and result in strengthening the pure monopoly elements in the market structure of a commodity; if policy goals and policies are not rationally formulated, the planning process itself may strengthen the monopoly elements in the economic structure. Appropriate policies to eliminate the effects of such monopoly elements in the Indian context are discussed in section III of the article.||V. V. Bhatt

It has been widely accepted that the Muslims were a backward people compared to the Hindus during British rule, that their leaders perceived their backwardness as a community and took measures to rectify it, which ultimately led them to separate solutions in politics. Available data on levels of social mobilisation and differential rates of change between Hindus and Muslims in the United Provinces during 1859-1931 does show that there was uneveness of development between the two communities - but it was the Muslims who were the more advanced community and the Hindus the less advanced. Muslims in the UP in the nineteenth century constituted a cultural and administrative urban elite whose language dominated in the courts and primary schools of the province. The rates of change among Muslims in several respects, including urbanisation, literacy and government employment, continued to keep ahead of rates of change among Hindus till 1931. The Muslims of the UP took the leading role in Muslim separatism because they were a privileged minority and their leaders were determined to maintain their privileges. But though rates of change were slower among Hindus, the sheer numerical superiority of the Hindus ensured that no matter how slowly they mobilised, they would ultimately displace Muslims from their privileged positions in public life. Hindu-Muslim relations became embittered because of Muslim fears of displacement by the rising Hindu majority and because of Hindu resentment at the tenacity with which the Muslim elites struggled to maintain their privileges against Hindu interests.

The objective is to provide for replacement of a capital asset. Depreciation is computed by applying prescribed rates to the written-down value of an asset. The law also allows accelerated depreciation in the form of an additional "extra-shift" allowance. Development rebate was also introduced as an inducement to capital formation in plant and machinery. Development rebate is granted in excess of the original cost of an asset, thereby providing a sizeable tax remission. The existing provisions regarding depreciation and development rebate have been criticised by Bhoothalingam. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate Bhoothalingam's alternative suggestions. It is contended that the major criticism of the existing methods can be surmounted by making an appropriate adjustment in the balancing allowance or balancing charge computed with reference to the original cost.

A regression of labour productivity on wage rate, according to the authors, shows a highly significant correlation in manufacturing industries. The regression co-efficient - the elasticity of substitution - varies from industry to industry. The present paper makes an attempt to test the logarithmic relation between the labour productivity and the wage rate for the Indian manufacturing industries spread over different regions for the year 1962. The hypothesis that value added and wages per worker are uncorrelated is rejected at least in ten out of seventeen two-digit industries. The rank correlation between share of wages and wage rate is also calculated to examine the distributive aspect of the production function. Thirteen industries confirm the good fit - relative wage share and wage rate moving in the opposite direction in those industries where elasticity of substitution is greater than one, and in the same direction where it is less than one.

Guidance and finance are also needed in the purchase of seeds, fertilisers, and pesticides. This is not an easy task, however, and to perform it the bank would have to collect the required information, ensure recovery of loans and interest, assist in obtaining after-sales service, and keep a watch on the working of the assisted enterprises. The task can be made easier by creating and supporting a set-up of approved dealers. Such an institution could, moreover, serve as a catalytic agent for widely diffused economic development. It would not only facilitate the bank's functioning but would also assist farmers and small industrialists, create employment opportunities in wholesale and retail trade and ensure a wide diffusion of technical and mechanical skills. This article outlines the several requisites for a set-up of this kind to ensure that it fulfils its purpose and so assists the lead bank in performing its own task effectively.||V. V. Bhatt

24/10/1970- ||special articles||4360646||Income or Capital?||Since income tax is a tax on income and not on capital, capital sums are not eligible to income tax. People therefore attempt to sell their future income for a capital sum, in an attempt to avoid income tax. Income being the base, the distinction between a revenue receipt and a capital receipt is, therefore, of crucial importance to any system of income taxation. What are the criteria for distinguishing one from the other? Few tax statutes provide the answer to this. There has consequently been almost exclusive reliance on rulings by the Courts, where this issue is debated time and again. This article attempts to survey these rulings and the principles underlying them. Commonsensically, any receipt which represents return of capital is a capital receipt while any receipt which represents current revenue is income. But while this distinction sounds simple enough, its application is riddled with difficulties in the absence of any precise indication of what is capital and what is revenue. Judicial decisions in these cases have not been very illuminating either. One cannot help feeling that, the basic issues involved in defining income for purposes of taxation have been lost sight of, and considerations extraneous to the issue have guided the Courts, resulting in an alarming degree of arbitrariness. Part of the blame for this conceptually confused state of affairs rests with economists; and much of the confusion could be avoided if the Courts were left to decide not 'what is income' but merely 'whether a given item of income is taxable under the law or not'.

Such surveys are yet to be developed in India and some efforts made in this direction have not yielded good results. An alternative approach based on the same idea stems from the nature of the financing of industrial projects in this country. Almost all major projects approach the term lending institutions which as a result have with them complete data on the projects for which they have been approached for assistance in one form or the other. By aggregating information about the time phasing of capital expenditure on projects, it should be possible to indicate the investment that is likely to be made in the course of a year on all the projects for which assistance has been provided. This paper presents the results of an exercise along these lines using data made available by the ICICI and the IFC.||C. Rangarajan

Instead we chose to adopt norms of the Western world as the massive amount of American management literature that has been absorbed in this country in the last two decades will testify. At the same time, on a national plane we have adopted socialism as our objective and large areas of industry have been kept strictly reserved for the public sector which is bound to increasingly enter other areas of activity, especially in the consumer goods field, as a direct competitor to the private sector corporations. How then can we assume that in the period ten to twenty years from today the Indian manager - his background, his challenges, his motivation, his 'extra-curricular' pursuits, everything that makes him up - will not be radically different from what we have known in the last ten to twenty years?||Arabinda Ray

Although a less-than-perfect vehicle for such analysis, the model can provide insight into the pattern of labour displacement, its possible rate and the composition of displaced farm workers. An attempt will be made to associate the composition of rural labour force with (1) specific production activities; and (2) farm sizes, such that we can have some grounds for associating the effects of technical changes upon employment per work group. Also, an examination will be made of the implications of alternative modes of tractor ownership upon custom operations for non-owners regarding both employment and the ability of the latter to share in new income opportunities.

It was Engels, the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of whose birth fell on November 28, who was the pioneer in this sphere and who, especially in his work on the condition of the working class in Britain, first achieved that dazzling clarity about the role of the working class in the present historical epoch which was rightly described by Lenin as the central theme of Marxism and the key insight of scientific communism.||Mohit Sen

Besides, the developmental programmes of Government have made for even stronger and more pervasive culture change. This paper attempts a study of culture changes in the light of these developmental activities and other forces of change, through a systematic comparison of two Gond villages, viz, Dhusawani and Mohapani-Malguzari, of which the former has been for a longer period, and more intensively, covered by welfare agencies than the latter.||K.

24/10/1970- ||special articles||4360647||Arya Samaj and Punjab Politics||Arya Samaj continues to profoundly influence Punjab politics. To understand Punjab politics, the role of the local Arya centres is particularly important. The local Arya centres bring together people who not only share their belief in the doctrine of Arya Samaj but are also in agreement over certain political issues and in their commitment to political parties. Control over local Arya centres helps politicians to get a hold over large sections of people in different localities. It also helps them to gain control over organisational machinery and educational institutions, thus enabling them to distribute patronage. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the chances of a candidate's success in elections from a constituency where there are a large number of local Arya centres are directly related to the extent to which he can mobilise support among members of these Arya centres. [This is a revised version of a paper presented at a seminar on "Social Research on Punjab" organised by Punjabi University, Patiala.

08/8/1970- ||special articles||4360302||New Urgency about Aid||There is a familiar unreality that surrounds everything written on international aid by experts associated with international agencies. This is because of the underlying fiction that aid and development are purely economic problems. In fact, aid and development issues are as much political issues. Aid is seldom given out of purely altruistic motives. More often, it is an instrument of foreign policy or even of exports for the aid-giving country. If experts pretend not to see this it is because they would otherwise lose their own raison d'etre. This article maintains that the 'Journal of World Trade Law' has done useful service by bringing together a competent collection of articles on aid raising all the relevant issues on aid and development and including articles which at least touch on the political aspects of international aid-giving. The author, however, doubts the unavoidable necessity of aid for development since there have been countries such as the Soviet Union which did develop, and China, which is developing, without foreign aid.||Ashok Rudra

21/11/1970- ||special articles||4360728||Macro-Perspective of Indian Community Development||The Community Development Programme has elicited two extreme views as to its success. One view regards the ideal aspect of the movement and exaggerates its success, thereby losing sight of some significant points in the process of innovation. The other view is very sceptical of the developmental aspects of the programme and tends to regard it as a total failure. Both views miss the reality of and the lessons held by the process of community development. This article seeks to examine in what respects the community development programmes may be considered a failure, and in what respects a success. An attempt it made to outline the manifest and latent consequences of the innovation effort. Three points emerge. First, there is not much indication of community development in terms of increasing community solidarity, or capacity for spontaneous self-help or mutual help - though the introduced innovations are fulfilling some useful functions, either manifest or latent, for the village communities. Secondly, while differentiation in the form of inputs of various sorts of innovative programmes is moving fast, the necessary concomitant integrative institutions to make the innovative programmes function effectively are lagging behind. And, finally, the economic innovations tend to widen the existing gap between the rich and the poor.||B. Minz

As it takes firmer shape the tertiary sector assumes increasing importance. The urbanisation of the Asansol-Durgapur region during the fifties and sixties is reflected in the structural changes in the occupational pattern of the working class. The relative importance of the primary sector in the region's economy declined, with shifts in favour of the manufacturing and service sectors. However there has been considerable lag between the growth of manufacturing and that of the service functions. Estimates for future years nevertheless clearly indicate increasing proportions of tertiary employment vis-a-vis manufacturing. The data for 1951, 1961, 1981 and 1986 are mostly drawn from the "Interim General Plan for Asansol-Durgapur" published by the Asansol Planning Organisation. Figures for other years have been derived from the surveys conducted by the Asansol Planning Organisation.

26/12/1970- ||review of agriculture, december 1970||4360877||Micro-Level Measurement of Scale Economics||Family labour and hired labour in Indian agriculture are not of the same quality. The advantage lies with hired labour. While, in terms of the history of capitalist development there seems nothing surprising in this, the question still remains of how the hypothesis can be tested at the micro level. This article argues that the solution to this problem lies at the very root of the economic basis of land reform. However, micro-econometric studies cannot reveal the difference between large and small farms. This impossibility is attributable to several reasons, the most important of which is that labour units measured in man-days simply by-pass the essential difference between farms using and not using hired labour. That difference is essentially a quality difference which cannot be analytically extricated from a production function model if it is missed in the original collection of farm data. The problem of micro level studies gettng mixed up with institutional adjustments particularly in the field of subsistence agriculture is not a new one. It is the problem of comparability of labour and other inputs in two institutionally different conditions. While a solution could be found, therefore, it cannot be found within a static micro frame.

It is, therefore, pertinent to study the effects of various socio-economic conditions on the different elements of population growth. This paper is a preliminary attempt in this direction. It analyses the effects of some socio-economic variables on population growth in Rajasthan during the inter-Census period, 1951-61. The author finds that no significant relationship can be established between the rate of population growth and the four socio-economic variables selected for study: the rate of urbanisation, literacy, density of population and per capita income.||B.

This paper stresses the importance of disaggregating the field of education regionally and sectorally as a preliminary to generalisation about educational standards. This method yields a differentiated view of the fate of standards. It is suggested that, at least statistically speaking, the expansion of higher education has not resulted in a swamping of the post-graduate sector by the first degree or pre-university levels. On the contrary, so far as the structure of higher education is concerned, there has been some upgrading. The proportion accounted for by the BA level has increased at the expense of the proportion accounted for by the intermediate and PUC levels and the post-graduate level has made a modest proportionate advance. Statistics also suggest a shift from arts to science, technology and the professions while the founding of new technological and scientific institutions of high quality suggest the upgrading of leading sectors for economic development. In the social sciences, new fields have been added and old ones strengthened since Independence and a few outstanding men in a variety of fields are, and are perceived to be, the peers of internationally outstanding professionals. If teaching and scholarly functions in post-graduate education have experienced a net gain, it is probably true that the ordinary BA-BSc education has suffered in the aggregate. Prior to Independence, when the BA was still the route to membership in a national elite, arts education, particularly at premier colleges, received considerable special attention and recruited a relatively limited number of well trained students. BA has, for the most part, lost what elite qualities it may have had; the special attention it used to attract has been increasingly diverted to professional and post-graduate education. It is probably safe to conclude that the very head of the academic procession has improved over its counterpart after Independence, even while its much larger tail has suffered from the enormous expansion in education. But even here, the statistical indexes do not permit a confident assertion of a 'decline'.||Lloyd I. Rudolph,Susanne Hoeber Rudolph

21/3/1970- ||special articles||4359759||Problems of Technical Education||Problems of technical education may be studied under three broad heads: preparation for technical education, technical education itself and the succeeding practical training. The ground for technical education has to be prepared by general education, through teaching of humanities and the basic sciences as well as imparting of basic skills over which the superstructure of more complicated skills can be built at a later stage. Coming to technical education proper, the problems concern the quality of students who joined technical institutions, determining how many students should be admitted at different levels and in different specialisations and preserving and improving quality in the context of the rapid expansion of technical education in recent years. Practical training is very unsatisfactorily organised today with industry taking very little interest. What is necessary is to formulate clearly the nature, content and methods of industrial training. The manner of financing of technical education is very important. The major beneficiary of technical education is industry. Industry should be made to pay and take full responsibility for the products it consumes. It is worthwhile in this context to examine whether some measure on the lines of the Industrial Training Act in UK would not be beneficial to technical education in this country.||D. P. Nayar

As these family farms undergo changes in size with the passage of time, a study of the transition of these farms from one class of operated area to another requires data of a dynamic type. The progression of each class of farms has to be traced over a sufficiently long period of time. The first part of the paper examines the relations that emerge between 'land owned' and 'land operated' and 'land owned' and 'land leased in'. The second part deals with the contentions put forth by Chayanov in developing his theory of 'labour consumer balance'. Punjab was selected for this study because the proportion of land leased in to the total operated area there is one of the highest in India.||S. K. Sanyal

Money and capital markets are highly individualistic and even more so are the social, legal and institutional factors affecting thrift, productivity and wealth. The impact of the rate of interest in India, therefore, must be studied in the context of Indian conditions which are characterised by extreme diversity. No attempt is made in this article to analyse factual and statistical data; only some opinions in regard to the quantitative and qualitative impact of interest rate variation have been examined.

As total cashew kernel exports went up in subsequent years, the US remained the major market and exports to it also rose. Yet the share of the US market progressively declined over the successive plans. This is partly because the shares of the USSR, Canada and West Germany have markedly gone up. Indeed, by recent reports, the USSR has outstripped the US as India's best customer. Yet the basic reason for the decline is to be found elsewhere and gives cause for concern. India imports most of its raw cashew from countries which are themselves now setting up processing capacity and emerging as India's rivals as exporters of cashew kernels. Also, India's marketing efforts have been not quite as thorough or imaginative as they might have been, or need to be, in an emerging competitive market.

21/11/1970- ||special articles||4360730||Review of Plan Implementation: Methodology and Mechanics||With hindsight many plausible reasons have been adduced to explain the tardy and indifferent implementation of plan programmes in the last two decades. Analysis of these reasons makes clear that many of the factors impeding effective implementation could have been controlled if close and timely watch had been kept during the implementation of plan schemes. It is in this context that the task of reviewing plan implementation and progress becomes necessary and useful. It is not that the executive authorities and policy-makers were unaware of the need to undertake such a task. But until recently the task of reviewing plan implementation or even that of evaluation of plan programmes and projects was deemed to be almost coterminous with that of progress reporting. It is only now that it is being accepted that review of plan implementation and evaluation of plan schemes begin where progress reporting ends. It is, therefore, essential to understand the methodology of making such a review and the mechanics of doing it. In other words, one has to know what to review and how to review.

21/2/1970- ||special articles||4359644||Centre-States Financial Relations in Context of Planned Development||Acceptance of a planned process of development has introduced a new dimension to Centre-State financial relations - a dimension which was not conceived of at the time of Constitution-making. The Central Government has now got an effective instrument in the Plan and in Plan assistance to the States to introduce a national bias in the economic policies of the States. But this instrument has not been properly integrated with others and, again, has been wielded in a manner which does not subserve the spirit of the Constitution. This paper proposes to survey the problems that have arisen in the field of Centre-State financial relations and to indicate the broad principles which should determine modifications in existing practices. One of the reforms suggested is the setting up of a National Development Bank with a view to co-ordinating and integrating effectively the procedures and practices enjoined by the Constitution with those which have developed as a result of economic planning.||D.

Whatever may be said in its favour from the point of view of revenue and social justice, the author concludes, a capital levy presents serious administrative and other problems. More important, within the framework of the mixed economy, the operation of a capital levy might upset a painstakingly acquired financial and economic equilibrium. If the impression gains ground that the levy might be repeated after some years, it might have serious repercussions on savings and capital formation. On balance of these considerations, it would be best, according to the author, to keep the capital levy in reserve for an emergency when the finances of Union Government cannot bear the strain of heavy expenditure and all normal sources of revenue are exhausted. The author also briefly examines two possible alternatives to a capital levy: a steep increase in income tax, particularly on unearned incomes, and a recurring tax on capital.||V. J. Singh

1/1/1970- ||emerging political system||4359544||Towards a Political Perspective for the Seventies||The first phase of Indian politics, institutionalised under the system of competitive dominance under Congress, came to an end in 1967. This was reflected less in the loss of Congress power in a few States than in a more drastic shift in loyalties caused by a growing congruence between issue orientation of voters, economic discontent, disaffection with government and defection from Congress. On the other hand, however, no viable institutional alternative had emerged which could replace the Congress system. Instead what appeared likely was a further fragmentation of the party system and the growth of pockets of right reaction and left militancy, concentrated in the urban areas and drawing support from a growing lower middle class suffering from a sense of economic insecurity and general discontent. Against this perspective the split in Congress acquires a new significance. The next phase of political development will now be on the basis of a realignment of the structure of the dominant party itself rather than its continuous erosion which would have splintered in so many directions, led to no significant alternative and strengthened the forces of anomie and extremism. As we enter the decade of the seventies, we move into India's second political transition. Failure to institutionalise this transition is likely to lead to a 'confrontation' of extremes which will be fought out not in rival plenary sessions but in the streets. [This article uses a small portion of cross-sectional data from a national sample study of voters in the 1967 general election conducted by the Centre for Study of Developing Societies. The main study will be reported in this journal later. The author is grateful to Douglas Madsen for processing the data for analysis. He is also indebted to N K Nijhawan and V B Singh for their help during the writing of the article and to D L Sheth and Ashis Nandy for their very helpful comments on the paper.]||Rajni Kothari

An attempt has been made in this article to estimate the magnitude of this additional demand. Although the study confirms the general belief that demand for agricultural labour has increased, the impact of this increase on the wage levels of agricultural labourers is not yet very clear. It seems clear nevertheless that the demand factor influences the wage level only after the existing reserve of unemployed agricultural labourers have been completely absorbed.||R. K. Lahiri

This happens because the HYV programme favours the promising and developing regions in which the necessary infrastructure for steady growth already exists, and because, within the regions thus marked for growth, the small farmers are less well-endowed compared to the large farmers to take on the new technology. The aim of this paper is to examine two important hypotheses, using empirical data collected from a district in West Bengal and a district in Bihar: First, whether the participation of small farmers in the programme is less than that of large farmers, and if so to what extent; Secondly, whether the differences in farm size tend to widen disparities in farm income among farms of varying sizes, and if so in what magnitude. It is found that, the participation of small farms in the HYV programme is less than that by the large farms, but that the small farmer's effective participation is no less satisfactory than that of the large farmer. At the same time, however, even at the present stage of implementation, the programme does further widen the gap in farm incomes, though the gap varies considerably as between the two crops, paddy and maize.||B.

Thus, ways in which farm tasks are shared between men and women vary among sub-cultures. However, with the application of the new technology in agriculture, the structure of agricultural production processes and employment patterns are undergoing rapid change. While there are wide inter-regional and inter-district differences in the female work participation rates in agriculture in the Punjab, these differences have been largely associated with three factors, in the following order of importance: (i) proportion of workers engaged in agriculture (ii) literacy among women (iii) gross value product per worker. A correlation analysis of the geographical differences supports the hypothesis that, with the economic development of an area, participation in farm work by women declines. While the immediate impact of the Green Revolution has been on the gross value product per worker, the extent to which it will affect female work participation rate is uncertain in the absence of a detailed study - which is, therefore, called for.

A knowledge of patterns of control within each group will become increasingly important in measuring as well as maintaining organisational cohesion and group effectiveness. One of the most important organised interests in the modern sector is the business community. Yet, though business forms the oldest, most bureaucratised and politically autonomous associational interest in society, and though much is surmised and emotionally asserted about its methods and motives, very little is actually known about the organisation, patterns of leadership and functioning of the business community as an organised interest group. This study of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, the most prestigious and influential among the three apex organisations representing trade and industry, shows that the pattern of oligarchic control of the Federation in the past was partly a product of the uneven development of industry; but it was also, in large part, brought about by the refusal of the vast majority of the rank and file membership to pay the costs of an effective organ of collective action. The result was a pattern of elite politics within the Federation which reflected traditional cleavages within the business community. With the increase in the number and size of medium and small-scale industrial units, the emergence of new industrial giants and the dispersion of industrial development throughout the country-all gradually reflected in a changing FICCI membership-, pressure from these and other long-ignored interests within the Federation began to build up. The FICCI leadership found itself faced with demands for broader representation in the councils of the Federation and for a larger say in policy-making. A new, more managerially oriented generation has begun to emerge in the FICCI and the power of a small handful of families has begun to decline. The Federation has moved somewhat in the direction of greater bureaucratisation. Yet development continues to be impeded by the persistence of traditional regional and communal residues which have inhibited the articulation of business interests. Perhaps, however, a recognition of the fact that interest groups, even those as apparently modern as the FICCI, are in fact an anomalous admixture of the old and the new is sufficient to provide the basis for effective collective action in spite of the persistence of promptings from the past. [This paper is based on interviews with 150 businessmen, government servants and business staff members. It is part of a large study of the politics of Indian business which will appear shortly in book form. The author wishes to acknowledge the support provided by the American Institute of Indian Studies during his 1967-68 sojourn in India.]||Stanley A. Kochanek

The ease with which business economists in the more developed countries can lay their hands on useful environmental data certainly has enabled them to play an influential role in their organisations. A strategy for improving the data system should undoubtedly receive the higher priority in India. The purpose of this paper is not to make a comprehensive analysis of all the data difficulties facing the Indian business economist. Such an attempt is no doubt important and must be made by the practising economists at an appropriate time. In the present paper, my objective will be to outline a framework for analysing data gaps and to raise some questions about the lines along which efforts should be made to improve the data system.

Increasing availability of farm management type of data in India has encouraged the use of farm production function as a tool in empirical analysis. Results obtained in these studies are not, how ever, very reliable, judged by criteria of goodness-of-fit and stability of estimated co-efficients from sample in the same region. There is need, therefore, to examine the methodological basis of these estimates. While a set of methodological assumptions are necessary in any empirical research, it may be that too rigid an adherence to those assumptions in farm production function studies has led to a neglect of potentially useful prior information in specifying the model. This paper describes two approaches to make such assumptions less restrictive and to assimilate better in these studies information that is usually available.||V. M. Rao

I||This is a detailed study of the social composition of Allahabad University and the effect of sociological factors on student politics. The reasons for student alienation are seen to emanate not only from within the University but also from the general social and economic deprivation prevalent in Allahabad and the rural areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh. Student politics at the University is regarded as the "intervening variable" between violence and alienation. The psychological need for such violence becomes apparent within the context of student frustrations. The various political groups, their connections and their leadership are analysed. Finally, there is a full account of the University's student union elections in the second half of 1969.||Walter Andersen,Alok Pant

Variations in the demographic and economic characteristics of the urban communities that surround Bangalore are examined with a view to testing whether these variations can be ascribed to differential access to the city. The process of urbanisation in Bangalore, the author finds, has not reached the level of maturity characterised by a well-knit and functionally integrated system of urban settlement. The present socio-economic linkages between the city and the surrounding urban communities are unidirectional, the benefits flowing from the urban settlements to the city.||K. B. Suri

Liberals fail to, or do not wish to, see the historical relationship between so-called modernism and traditionalism which, unlike what even self-styled liberal heretics such as Myrdal, Galbraith and Rostow might say, are not distinct characteristics peculiar to particular regions of the world but are the result of an international system, which exploits many for the benefit of the few. What is commonly called modernity is the result of the creation and maintenance of the so-called traditional characteristics of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Liberal social scientists insist on dividing the international social system into non-existent and artificially separate entities, leaving out evidence which they feel is inconvenient to their thesis of a dichotomised world. It is their thought which is traditional, orthodox and pseudo-scientific. History indicates that the exigencies of a growing mercantile and, later, industrial capitalist system, led to the development of Europe and North America while causing the underdevelopment of Asia, Africa and Latin America. It was also instrumental in creating local bourgeoisies in the colonies who had no reason to invest in the economic development of their own territories and who were, and still are, dependent on the metropolitan bourgeoisie of the United States and Europe. It is the responsibility of honest social scientists to break out of blinkered patterns of thought and develop a social science theory which encompasses the reality of the nature and causes of the wealth - and poverty - of nations.||Andre Gunder Frank

11/4/1970- ||special articles||4359855||Trade between Developed and Developing Countries||While the need for rapid expansion of the export earnings of developing countries has been recognised for accelerating their rate of economic development, the most decisive efforts made by these countries to boost their export trade meet with hardly any success. Though advanced countries over the past decade have reduced quantitative import restrictions, most West European countries have yet maintained a certain hard core of restrictions. In fact some of the highest rates in the tariff schedule of advanced countries apply to light manufactures such as woven fabrics, jute footwear, textiles, etc, which are of particular importance to developing countries. General tariff reductions are not of much use to developing countries whose position in international trade is clearly weak and who are more often interested in particular items. It would be more useful if advanced countries were to give preferential treatment to imports of certain manufactures from developing countries. Several different preferential arrangements are possible, ranging from a one-way free trade for all manufactures exported by developing countries to a system giving special consideration to items of vital importance to the trade and growth of developing countries.||Mangat Ram

The movement re-emerged in 1969, offering certain new characteristics absent in the earlier phase of the movement. Faced with the reality of gherao and similar other militant phenomena, questions that seem appropriate are. What role does the new technique have to play in the social ferment that is going on in India? What is the meaning of this mode of confrontation between numbers on the one hand and authority on the other? Where will this urban-centre located social conflict lead to? In other words, in the event gherao is looked upon as a tool for social intervention, what kind of change will this intervention technique usher in? Will the movement take the respectable course of "business-unionism", or will it mean preparation for a struggle to change the social system itself? The following paper identifies some of the characteristics of the movement, which may suggest some answers to these questions. [A revised version of this paper will appear in Hornstein, HA, et al, "Strategies of Social Intervention", New York, Free Press, forthcoming.]||Nitish R. De

Elasticities significantly less than unity could mean that the existing number is less than the number desired by the farmers on economic grounds." This is not a correct formulation; for, what is relevant here are not elasticities but marginal productivities. Output elasticities are irrelevant to answer the question under discussion. Even if they are relevant, the choice of the Cobb-Douglas function is inappropriate, first, because it can rarely yield elasticities greater than unity and, second, because it assumes the elasticities to be constant. In fact, marginal productivities are relevant. But the choice of a linear production function would be inappropriate because it assumes marginal productivities to be constant. What is needed is a production function which permits variation in marginal productivities.||V. M. Dandekar

While no country's experience can say anything conclusive about what another can or cannot do, consideration of what has been attempted is a necessary supplement to theory. In this light, this article discusses some aspects of Cuba's sugar harvest of 1970. The target of ten million tonnes set for the 1970 sugar season is, as are many other policies of the Cuban Government, rooted in a set of goals that the Cuban Revolution has set forth. One goal is, to be sure, national development, expressed in terms of economic and strategic strength. But the other goals stress social justice. Cuban planners make decisions which sometimes are distinct from those which would be made if the objective were only to maximise material production-though it is unclear in these cases whether in the end much material output is given up. The trade-off between growth, equality and working conditions is, of course, complex. The decision to try for a ten million ton sugar harvest involved evaluation of such opportunities and limits.||Matthew Edel

12/9/1970- ||special articles||4360460||Modernisation and Rural Stratification: An Application at the Micro-Level||Modernisation depends upon two basic characteristics of society, viz, institutionalisation of modern values and adaptability of the society concerned. These two attributes are closely associated with stratification and cultural legitimation. The nature of our stratification system is segmental and hierarchical based on certain historical forces. The difficulty is not in changing the values of this system. The difficulty is that, there is a pervasive and acute lack of means among the already non-privileged to adopt and internalise the modern values. The privileged groups are in a position to adopt these values, and are consequently able to maintain qualitatively the same status-distinctions in relation to the non-privileged sections, though now on the basis of new factors such as education, office, economic position, white-collar jobs, outside contacts, and styles of life. So value-change does not come as a barrier in the process of modernisation. It is the unequal or differential accessibility to the attributes of modernisation which is the barrier and which is basically due to the particularistic nature of our stratification system. Because of this, institutionalisation and legitimation of modern values are partial, limited and un-universalistic.

25/4/1970- ||special articles||4359903||Role of Sociology in Medical Education and Research||There appears to be general agreement that some training in the social sciences can help the medical practitioner in his profession. There are, however, certain specific questions about the introduction of social sciences in medical education: in which phase of his medical training should the medical student be taught the social sciences; who should provide this training; which aspects of social sciences should form part of the training; what should be the proportion of social sciences training in the total training received by the trainee; and how should this instruction be imparted. Answers to these questions will help determine whether social sciences could be merely added to the present medical curriculum, or the addition will require a radical change in the system of medical education so as to achieve a new integration. It is also necessary to ask whether the social sciences in India are so developed as to be capable to giving the medical practitioners what they actually require. This question is important because the purpose behind the introduction of social sciences in the medical curriculum is not just to make the medical students familiar with the contents of the various social sciences but to make them aware of how the social science orientation will be useful to them in playing their professional role more effectively. The content of social sciences introduced in medical education would vary according to the level of such education. What is taught to the medical undergraduate would be different from what is taught to students preparing to take post-graduate degrees or diplomas in such subjects as social and preventive medicine, public health, occupational medicine, hospital administration and health administration. It will also be necessary to work out the role of each of the different social sciences in medical education and research. In this paper the authors have confined themselves to discussion of the role of sociology (including social and cultural anthropology). [This paper was prepared originally for the seminar on "Teaching of Social Sciences in Medical Colleges" held in New Delhi, October 6-11, 1969.

30/5/1970- ||review of management, may 1970||4360052||Scientific Bank Management: A Consultant's View||Banks in developing countries are often highly profitable, and may earn a higher rate of return on invested capital than their counterparts in the developed countries. But this profitable situation is the consequence of higher interest rates on loans, multiple fees incidental to granting of loans, low wages, and higher commissions for services. The profitability of the banks is not by any means an indicator of their efficiency. Indeed, while some of these banks may be making significant efforts to improve their management and organisation, others are not even willing to recognise the need for any such overhaul. They thus unwittingly face the threat of nationalisation because banking services in the economy are being inadequately performed, or they may suddenly get competed out by rival banks who successfully streamline their own operations. A consultant could help banks in such circumstances, first, to realise that there is a management problem involved which could be identified and resolved and, second, to reorganise themselves so as to improve their operational efficiency and business initiative. The pattern of obstacles to efficiency and enterprise is similar among banks in developing countries even though they may be continents apart. The consultant has to quickly determine the obstructions which he cannot overcome such as legislation and unionisation and waste no time on them since in any case they have probably received the attention of the bankers' associations without success. There are also impediments that are part of the old cultures and to remove which would take years. The consultant has to use tact in outlining the problem areas so as not to blame any one and in selling the idea of a certain kind of reorganisation so as to make those who are to implement the scheme feel that they themselves have conceived of the general idea. Even so he is likely to face opposition which may come from any level. Resistance may come because executives do not wish to carry heavier burdens, or are on the defensive because of the inefficient organisation they have fathered in the past, or want to deal with customers in person so as to appear indispensable to boards of directors, or place temporary personal benefits above the good of their banks and the economies of their countries. They may use all kinds of other reasons to justify their opposition, however, and the consultant has to carefully point to the immense benefits that could accrue on reorganisation. A significant field in which the consultant has to reform management is in their treatment and payment of bank employees. Unionisation in banks has often been a regressive force, but managements have contributed to this state of affairs by paying their staff poorly compared to the large profits and by not bothering about the deplorable working conditions of most of them. Managements have to be taught that delegation of authority in a carefully restructured organisation so as to reserve only the more important decisions for top management is the best way to foster initiative and hard work and to improve customer service.||Henry A.

Four villages of south Bengal in which Scheduled Castes and Tribes predominate numerically, have been studied. The period covered is roughly that of the Second and Third Plans. The conclusion that emerges is that the educational condition of the backward castes did not improve during this period. At the end of the period from 65 to 96 per cent of the backward caste population was still illiterate. Among females, illiteracy levels ranged between 90 and 100 per cent. School registration of children of school-going age, a crucial indicator of future trends in literacy, went up in two of the four villages studied and down in the other two. It is significant that the deterioration had taken place in those villages where the backward castes were mainly agricultural labourers or share-croppers.

With their bases confined to urban or minority pockets, the other parties have perforce to align themselves with UNP and SLFP or remain in the political wilderness In the elections, announced for this year, it will be once again UNP and SLFP which will contend for power.

The opportunities and challenges lie within industry itself - particularly with top-level management which must demonstrate its capacity for vision and innovation if it is to seize the growth prospects offered by modern science and technology. The challenge is also to policy-makers in Government, more so because public policy impinges so heavily on industry's own decision-making. At present there is considerable conflict in policies related to technological change in Indian industry. Tax incentives for R and D expenditure, the existence of machinery to regulate foreign collaboration within Indian industry, and the creation of a chain of government-supported industrial research laboratories, are the major government initiatives to encourage industrial growth through technological change. Effects of these are often offset, however, by certain other factors, such as reservation of certain sectors of industrial activity for public undertakings in what amounts to quasi-monopolistic conditions, limitation of production through industrial licensing which creates a 'sellers' market', limitation of concentration of ownership in industry, and an industrial relations policy which, in seeking to protect rights of labour, frequently has the net effect of inhibiting management in choosing significant technological innovations. The central question is of priorities which political leadership has to determine. In fact, political leadership will have to decide just how high modern science and technology need to be placed in the hierarchy of national goals. [This essay is adapted from a paper presented to the Seminar on Corporate Strategy and Long Range Planning, held at the Administrative Staff College of India, Hyderabad, in July 1970. The staff College plans to issue the proceedings of that Seminar shortly. Much of the statistical data which we have on research and development in India, including expenditures on R and D personnel, reflect estimates rather than hard figures. Interpretations based on these data necessarily exhibit some of the qualities of the data on which they are based.]||Ward Morehouse
1/7/1970- ||groyth with justice||4360266||Wanted in India: A Relevant Radicalism||The present political leadership in India is correct in sensing the need for a radical turn of affairs in favour of the common man. There is less evidence, however, that it has digested the proposition that the new radicalism must be effective-that it must be built around solid, substantial and quick delivery of additional jobs, incomes ond opportunities to the very poor. The evidence is also inconclusive that the leadership fully recognises the positive, inescapable linkage between a relevant radicalism and the economy's aggregate growth performance. The worst idiocy is to suppose that because progress, such as the breakthrough in agriculture, generates contrast and conflict, things could be nicely damped down by choosing slower growth. It is almost as important to realise, however, that no adequate attack on low-end poverty can be made by squeezing 5 1/2 per cent growth into a different shape. In particular any effort to regiment agriculture or pare its incentives will serve only to stunt the one newly dynamic, thrustful factor in the system. Nor, as one looks over the Fourth Plan's already pruned bill of projected investments or considers the distribution of industrial incomes, does one find much room for reallocation in favour of the presently unproductive poor. This means that an old saw of development economics-that one must always look for tradeoffs between greater equity and faster growth-is mostly misleading. The only feasible way to get substantially more equity into the Indian system in the 1970s is as dividend from still faster growth, faster than the readily available 5 1/2 per cent. The strategy for such a hyper-acceleration would be to spend boldly-far more radically than ever before-on a continuing labour-intensive, mostly public-financed, construction programme. The economy urgently needs an endless variety of productive facilities producible by labour-intensive means. Thus there is no need for leaf-raking. A massive labour-intensive construction programme sensibly conceived and deployed could add almost as much to the economy's future productive potential as could an equivalent volume of public and private investment aimed at maximum-return uses. But the direct employment and income benefits of such a programme could be tilted toward the very poor, substantial numbers of whom it would directly employ. Very rough calculations suggest some possible dimensions for this kind of an attack on low-end poverty in the 1970s. In terms of the additional demands for consumer and investment goods it would generate, the rest of the economy should be able to cope successfully with an extra outlay of at least Rs 750 crores annually that would directly and indirectly generate 8 million jobs and raise the GNP growth rate from 5 1/2 per cent to 7 per cent per annum.||John P.

These fears were not without basis. As some European central bankers saw it, so long as the free market price of gold remained at or above $ 35 an ounce, they retained the option to sell gold for dollars in the free market. But once the price fell below $ 35 an ounce, this option could only be exercised at a loss. The result would be a relative weakening of the position of these European central bankers as against the US, a possibility which they understandably resented. Therefore, had the free market price been allowed to fall below $ 35 an ounce, European central bankers were bound to have asked for the institution of a system of international payments which gave no relative advantage to the US. This, in turn, would have started a serious search for a system of international payments based not on dollar but on an international reserve currency. What has actually happened, however, is that an accord has been reached whereby the international monetary system will keep increasing its gold stocks so that if the price of gold in the free market shows signs of falling substantially below $ 35 an ounce, pressure is bound to mount for additional steps to underpin the free market price. In this lies the whole danger of a movement backward rather than forward towards a genuinely international payments system.

It is necessary for the ideologies of all modernising elites to come to grips with the very difficult problem of what constitutes modernity. There can be no simple Western answer to the question of modernisation in India. Managers need first of all to recognise the ideological cast of their thinking on society and to understand the indigenous character of their society. This will be difficult so long as they regard themselves as being free of 'ideological taint' - as being primarily 'men of action' employing specific means to specific ends, making use of nothing more than the canons of reason. Once recognition is given to the existence of 'managerial ideology', its critical analysis and reformulation, to better accord with the larger goals of a democratic society bent on modernisation, may be a less painful task than would appear at first sight.||A.

21/3/1970- ||special articles||4359757||Employment in the Construction Industry Does It Have to Be so Unstable?||Instability of the construction industry signifying the volatility of construction investment, and the unstable and irregular nature of construction employment, are not the same thing and need to be distinguished from each other. This paper is concerned with the latter problem and its possible solution. While in the developed regions the construction industry has long been regarded as an economic shock absorber, in the developing countries the industry's expansion may be yet considered for soaking a large influx of unemployed people. In fact, even the view that construction workers cannot expect assured jobs round the year is largely based on custom and tradition, and not on any scientific observations. While in the European countries, in the USA, and in Canada, it has been found possible to carry out construction jobs during winter, the monsoon in India has been regarded as a deterrent factor in construction leading to large-scale instability in employment for a vast body of workers. A field study of the roads and buildings construction industry of the Union Territory of Tripura indicates that, the period of involving unemployment is not significant enough to cause serious anxiety, but that, on the other hand, the uncertainty for the workers is enormous. The co-existence of relatively high continuous employment and an air of anxiety and uncertainty calls for special study in any scheme of decasualisation.||S. N. Guha Thakurta

As the Americans and the Canadians have greater financial and scholastic resources at their disposal for social science research, they have been able to acquire vast "banks" of information. Very often this information has been collected for or used by the American Department of Defence and other American agencies for their own dubious purposes in Afro-Asia and Latin America. Other Western (which includes Russian) social scientists have also wittingly or unwittingly, played a political role in pursuing their "academic" work. The author examines the relationship of North American social scientists with the poorer world. He classifies them into three groups, the Supremacists, the Purists and the Reformers. The Reformers are a small minority group and are the only ones concerned about the political-ethical implications of international social science. He suggests that African and Asian social scientists should scrutinise Western social science tracts more carefully and should develop the social sciences in their own countries with greater energy.||Satish Saberwal

In the context of the requirements of an economy like India's, the financial institutions have to play a much more positive role with regard to (a) identification of new projects, (b) their selection in the light of the Plan, and (c) efficient management of industrial enterprises. In short, financial institutions have to provide entrepreneurial and managerial guidance for accelerating the growth rate of industrial investment and output.||V. V. Bhatt

In the land reform programmes undertaken in post-Independence India, tenure and related problems have been focused on. The other, equally important, aspect of land policy, relating to utilisation, conservation and development needs of the land have received scant attention. In some regions, in fact, these latter aspects of land reform have far greater significance for raising farm productivity than the tenurial aspects have. There are large tracts of Rajasthan that are among such regions. And the purpose of this paper is to highlight the gaps in the land policies of Rajasthan with reference to the arid region which covers nearly three-fifths of the State.

The study shows that in marketing of raw cotton, the farmer's share in the eventual realisation from sales of both cotton lint and cottonseed is as high as 90 per cent. Marketing costs, including returns to merchants account for the rest. Contrary to the general impression, gross returns to cotton merchants averaged only three to four per cent of aggregate sales. Net returns, after meeting establishment expenses, interest on borrowed funds, etc, were obviously lower. The evidence suggests that the present system of marketing of cotton is more efficient than its critics give it credit for.

There is, therefore, need today to reorder Centre-State relations with a view to enlarging the autonomy of the States, particularly with regard to industrialisation. There is reason to believe, too, that encouragement of local initiative through decentralisation is far more likely to succeed than a centralised plan administered from New Delhi. Regional planning elicits less psychological resistance and more direct commitment. The performance of States such as Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu bears out this hope. This article argues that the Southern States are, in fact, among the well advanced States, adequately endowed and with the infrastructure which make them especially suited to industrial development.||M.

30/5/1970- ||review of management, may 1970||4360050||The Dynamic Concept of Marketing||The marketing function has so far been viewed in a rather narrow sense. The emphasis is placed largely on production. This applies both at the Government level as manifested in the approach to planning and also at the implementation end of business and industry. The effort is oriented towards securing resources for production. The capacity of the market for the product in terms of its acceptance, specifications, variety and even price is taken for granted. One consequence of this narrow view of the marketing function is imbalances in the economy. The production-oriented control mechanism takes a fair amount of time to adjust itself to compelling market forces and this results in waste of resources and time. The dynamic concept of marketing, discussed here, would familiarise the entrepreneur, through a study of market and product segmentation, with existing conditions in the market and likely developments. Equipped with this information, the entrepreneur would be in a better position to decide on his entry into the market and the particular segments of the market to enter. Further, the wider concept of marketing helps to develop a progressive and innovative outlook. Instead of obtaining an industrial licence and hopefully rushing into manufacture, the industrialist would have an idea of the realities of the market and the existing and anticipated requirements of consumer/customers. The resultant development of new products, preferably with available indigenous resources, designed to satisfy new needs and changing requirements would go a long way in strengthening the industrial base of the country.||M.

It is not often realised that the lot of a large number of urban children is not any better and in some cases even worse due to the peculiar consequences of urbanisation. There is a dangerous fallacy in assuming that the existence of a variety of agencies providing education, health, public amenities and recreational and cultural activities in cities will by itself ensure that all urban children are bound to receive their benefit. An examination of a few aspects of the condition of urban children reveals how these services often fail to reach quite a sizeable number.||Sindhu Phadke

While some have maintained that farmers are sensitive to price changes others have definitely concluded that there is no significant price response. The basic interest of the following study is the response of total planned production to price changes. The frequent large gaps between planned and actual output force econometric studies to approximate planned output not by actual output but by area planted which is usually more within the control of farmers. Area planted, not actual production, is thus considered the dependent variable in the present examination of supply responses. The findings of the present study, using the 'adjustment model', support the view that farmers are sensitive to price changes in their product.

Government as well as Forward Markets Commission have often found fault with speculative activity in futures markets for aggravating short-term price movements. At the same time, however, little empirical evidence has been presented in support of such charges against forward trading. An attempt is made in this article, through a study of variations in spot prices of groundnut over a period of 15 years from 1951-52 to 1965-66, to assess the true effects of futures trading on price variability. The evidence presented in this paper shows that spot prices of groundnut fluctuated less widely when there was futures trading than in its absence. Of course, evidence of beneficial effects in one commodity does not ipso facto prove that similar effects would follow for other commodities. But the case of groundnut examined here does rebut the commonly held belief that futures trading necessarily accentuates the amplitude of short-period price variations.||M. G. Pavaskar

(b) Increase in per capita income of the poor leads to increase in the amount they spend on food. (c) Increase in the amount spent on food by the poor leads to improvement in nutrition. (d) Improvement in nutrition of a poor family means improvement in nutrition for the pre-school aged members of the family. This paper suggests that each of these assumptions is open to question. Moreover, even if the assumptions are valid, increase in per capita income may not provide the necessary nutritional improvement within the life-span of the needy. Nor would dependence on income growth necessarily be the most effective way. To determine the most effective way of eliminating malnutrition we must look differently, and more systematically, at the factors affecting nutritional wellbeing, especially of children. What is being suggested here is a conceptual re-examination of the problem of improving nutrition so as to bring about an approach to the problem both more systematic and more in tune with the complex realities of contemporary decision-making.||Alan Berg

A large and growing debt-servicing capacity provides important options to the developing countries at a time when the aid relationship is not what it could be. But the principle underlying a policy for terms of aid should not be to tap this growing capacity; it is that the nature of the development task is such that it requires long-term sustained investment in areas which are not immediately productive. This provides the basic rationale for concessional aid for development of underdeveloped areas, as distinguished from investment in petroleum mining or bailing out the poor and the indebted.||Bimal Jalan

Their relevance to the study of all 'developing societies' has also been stressed in recent times. Usually, however, the two concepts are not evaluated critically before their application to these societies. In India, this has resulted more in confusing the situation than in clarifying it; similar possibilities have occasionally been pointed out for other 'developing societies'. In this situation, evaluation of either of the two concepts is required on its content and the manner of its application. Specified in this manner, the two concepts will maintain their universal validity while being useful particularistically: a position which their imitative and a-contextual application to different societies may fail to attain. The objective of this paper is to initiate discussions on these points.||Ramkrishna Mukherjee

23/5/1970- ||special articles||4360017||Reserve Money and Money Multiplier||It is generally held that the Central Bank can control money supply in a fairly automatic and reliable fashion by producing changes in monetary liabilities or by changing legal reserve requirements. The composition of reserve money as well as the low money-multiplier ratio in India indicate that preference for cash transactions has not undergone any substantial change over the past 20 years. The quantum of money supply is largely dependent on the currency liabilities of the Central Bank and, with a not very high ratio of multiple credit creation, the Central Bank can vary the quantum of money supply considerably only by varying its currency liabilities. This study, covering the period 1950-69, shows that in most of the years the major cause of variations in reserve money was governmental indebtedness to the Central Bank and, in some years, variations in foreign assets. Other transactions did not have any significant role. Thus the Reserve Bank of India does not seem to have much control over changes in currency in circulation and so on the quantum of money. Since varying reserve requirements cannot have a very significant impact, varying the cost of credit and selective credit control are of greater significance among the instruments of credit control.||S.

The major conclusions of the paper are twofold: (1) Social cost-benefit analysis can be adapted to provide a useful conceptual framework for the economic evaluation of educational programmes. The nature of costs and returns is such that of all forms of education this approach seems most relevant to the evaluation of management education. (2) The results of the social cost-benefit analysis of the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, attempted here show that allocation of resources for management education at the national level is justified even when judged under the most pessimistic assumptions about costs and returns.||Samuel Paul

First, because non-agricultural capital is also too meagre to offer an alternative source of employment. And secondly, because capital in agriculture and in its infrastructure is itself inadequate to support growth and further accumulation. The process of capital accumulation is cumulative, and unfortunately, so is the reverse process. Once the rate of capital accumulation falls behind the rate of population growth, it becomes increasingly difficult to sustain that rate. For, with capital accumulation lagging behind population growth, the output per capita falls and the surplus over subsistence of the population is reduced, and the rate of capital accumulation decreases. The process does not stop there because population continues to grow independently. Since the pressure of population is not uniformly spread, there are, at one extreme, a few large farms owned by a few persons and producing a surplus and, at the other, are numerous small farms owned by a large majority of the population. Feudal arrangements between these two sub-sectors take the form of tenancy and share-cropping. Basically, as these institutions work themselves out, this amounts to exploitation and inevitably results in accelerating the deprivation of both land and man. While the case against tenancy is obvious, regulation and prohibition of tenancy are riddled with difficulties. The problem is how to halt and reverse this process. Communism offers a logically well-conceived solution-North Vietnam offering a shining example of what even a small Asian country can achieve. But 'soft' governments, unsupported by a countrywide political cadre and without a determined leadership, have to work within the framework of private property in land. If agricultural growth is to be promoted through capitalist farming, there is not enough land to give out to the landless. Indeed, it might be better for the landless to remain landless than be tied down to an uneconomic piece of land. The fundamental issue of equality and social justice cannot be resolved by such means. Similarly, if ceilings on land-imposed to check the power of the capitalist farmer and release land for the landless-are such as to drive enterprise away from agriculture, the purpose of growth will be ill served. A twin policy is thus required. The capitalist sector in agriculture as in industry must be regulated to protect the labour hired by it. And the capitalist sector in agriculture, as in industry, must be taxed sufficiently to enable the residual landless labour to be gainfully employed in creating capital and infrastructure for further agricultural growth.||V.

While the absolute level of monetary resources serves as a crude indicator, the full impact of monetary resources cannot be judged without taking into account the income velocity of money resources. This article presents the annual income velocity of monetary resources between 1955-56 and 1968-69. On the basis of the observed time trend of this, it then suggests the likely behaviour of income velocity in the last year of the Fourth Plan, 1973-74.||S. R. Krishna Iyer

Within a State there is no significant variation in the pattern. However, there is significant difference between the pattern of individual States. While, on the one hand, the average village-wise concentration ratios, based on the size of operational holding, is higher in paddy areas than in wheat areas, there is, on the other hand, lesser variation in inequality among villages in terms of co-efficient of variation in paddy areas than in wheat areas. The distinctive difference in the average of concentration ratios at the block level for the country as a whole is mainly accounted for by the inter-State variations in the land distribution pattern, particularly for the wheat areas.||P.

The co-operatives also have large savings which are used for financing manufacturing industry. Much of the success of agricultural co-operatives in Japan is due to strong Government support, manifest in the use of the co-operatives as a device for implementing the National Agricultural Policy, the economic benefits accruing from co-operative services and the overall efficiency resulting from rationalisation. The lesson to be drawn from the success of co-operatives in Japan is that co-operatives can be exploited to provide an outlet for the urge for capital formation and development if this urge has already been created in the farm economy by appropriate programmes of education, training, research and extension, supported by suitable institutional reforms. [This paper is the result of a seven-day trip to Japan in April last year. Ruyichi Okada supplied the author with information verbal, mimeographed, and printed, and helped to conduct a field-trip which formed the basis of this article.

The two Reports bring out clearly the Commission's lack of expertise and its irrelevance to problems of Industrial growth which should be its concern.

One of the most important of such neglected elements is the changing behaviour, opinions and attitudes of voters. Voter behaviour and voter development have been ignored in analyses of our political system. Even when the level of political development is not as high as one would like it to be, elections in an open polity are more than mere rehearsals for endorsement of the assumed structural needs of the system. Voters do learn to act politically and do imbibe political elements into their universe of perceptions and evaluations. This paper attempts to examine, with the help of empirical data, to what extent these political elements have been imbibed by the Indian electorate and been stabilised in the preference structure of voters. The questions sought to be answered are: (a) Has the electorate reached the level of political development necessary for the electoral process to be autonomous in its influence on different aspects of the political system? (b) What are the behaviourial and attitudanal responses of voters towards political parties and, in general, towards the political system? [This paper is based on a preliminary analysis of data collected in two large-scale studies of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi. The two studies were directed on behalf of the Centre by Bashiruddin Ahmed and Rajni Kothari (1967 study) and Ramashray Roy (1969 study). More detailed analysis of the data is under way and the results will be reported in a series of articles in this journal. The present article has a particular substantive and theoretical interest and uses only a fraction of the data. The author is indebted to Rajni Kothari and Ramashray Roy for their very helpful comments on a preliminary draft of this paper. He is also thankful to N K Nijhawan for his help in computer analyses.]||D. L. Sheth

In actual practice, however, the procedural operation of the clause has been such that not merely has the facility ceased to have any benefit for member countries with weak reserves but it has even constituted a continuing and cumulative disability to them in their transactions with the Fund. The following paper argues for an interpretation of the related Articles which will be more consistent with the intention of the Founding Fathers and with the general present policy of the Fund to gear itself to the needs of the weaker members of the international trading community.||M.

It was also shown that Parsi mercantile capital was ripe for industrial transformation and that an allround development towards an indigenous navigation and shipbuilding industry was already witnessed in the second quarter of the 19th century. Thereafter this development process was choked off and distorted mainly because of the colonial constraints. The present article continues the arguments and tries to analyse the behaviour-pattern of the Parsi Seths on their way to limited industrialisation within the bounds of colonial fetters.Their dubash-banian background, together with their mechanical aptitude, appear to have dominated their attitudes all throughout the 19th century.||Amalendu Guha

The dimension of the shortfall may not be large, but nonetheless it will call for adjustments in sectoral allocations as we go along. The need for adjustments so as to contain credit expansion within the total of monetary expansion consistent with price stability will become more pressing if there are additional demands on the banking system's resources on account of buffer-stocking programmes in food and other commodities.

II||This is a detailed study of the social composition of Allahabad University and the effect of sociological factors on student politics. The reasons for student alienation are seen to emanate not only from within the University but also from the general social and economic deprivation prevalent in Allahabad and the rural areas of eastern Uttar Pradesh. Student politics at the University is regarded as the "intervening variable" between violence and alienation. The psychological need for such violence becomes apparent within the context of student frustrations. The various political groups, their connections and their leadership are analysed. Finally, there is a full account of the University's student union elections in the second half of 1969. [In the first part of this article published last week there was a short historical sketch of Allahabad University followed by a detailed survey of student backgrounds. The student union's workings from 1947 to 1968 were also examined. In this second and concluding part, there is a comprehensive review of student political groups and candidates involved in the 1969 union elections. Responses to questions answered by candidates and an analysis of voting patterns are included.]||Walter Andersen,Alok Pant

Is the growth of population the only factor responsible for the tragedy in our cities? What about municipal corruption, political nepotism and the obsolete bureaucratic set-up? Why is the housing situation so bad in Delhi where the density is low in many areas and where in fact the Master Plan had recommended raising the density? The present crisis in urban housing is basically a consequence of our outmoded thinking on the subject. Not that the urban housing problem has been solved satisfactorily anywhere in the world but at least there are some outstanding examples of bold and imaginative housing programmes.||Ashish Bose

This has alarmed South Africa which has become increasingly involved, militarily and economically, in shoring up the Portuguese and the Rhodesians. The main props of these white supremacist regimes, however, are the Western powers who are keenly concerned about maintaining their role as economic exploiters. Financial credit and arms are generously given to these regimes, conveniently forgetting the blatantly oppressive nature of the white ruling groups.

05/9/1970- ||special articles||4360432||Some Aspects of Deposit Mobilisation||The banking system is unlikely to be in a position to meet the demand for bank credit from the priority sectors - agriculture and small-scale industry - unless a concerted policy is pursued to raise the rate of saving generally and the rate of saving in the form of deposits in particular. So far, agriculture and small industry have been largely relying on borrowing from the unorganised market. To the extent to which the banking system is able to supplant this market, the latter's resources would be released for other purposes. Unless, therefore, the banking system can attract these released resources as deposits, it would not be able to meet the demand for credit that is likely to be generated. Of course, it should be possible to induce borrowers in the organised sector to restrict their demand for credit to some extent and this needs to be done. But such switching has its limits. From a long-run point of view, the banking system can be viable only if it can mobilise deposits at the required rate. And this can be done only by making a bank deposit more attractive as a financial asset than private lending in the unorganised market. It is the purpose of this article to suggest certain deposit schemes which can serve the purpose of raising the saving rate in general and the rate of deposit expansion in particular.||V. V. Bhatt

Various measures have been tried to achieve this objective: rigid movement restrictions, intensive procurement and price control, followed by relaxations as the overall situation eased. An attempt has been made in this paper to evaluate the effect of these measures.

20/6/1970- ||special articles||4360137||Electricity Tariff in a Developing Economy: With Special Reference to India||The many commissions and committees that have gone into the question of electricity tariff have uncritically accepted the historical pattern of tariffs and have made almost no attempt to modify it to achieve economic objectives like full utilisation of capital. Statistics of load factor and utilisation factor for the power systems in different States show, in both agriculture and industry, widespread underutilisation of capacity created by the consumers to use electricity. It is suggested in this article that a two-part tariff structure can be evolved which will improve not only the load factor but also the demand factor. In agriculture, a suitable minimum guarantee charge for electricity is likely to lead to community utilisation of equipment such as for lift irrigation. This will encourage installation of a network of lift irrigation schemes by co-operatives and may result in the pooling of resources of small cultivators enabling them to derive the benefits of rural electrification which have been denied to them so far. In industry, a minimum guarantee charge will be resisted on the ground that the higher cost of electricity will raise overall cost of production. But this argument is baseless since, except for a few industries like aluminium, coldstorage and inorganic heavy chemicals, electricity is not a significant item in the cost structure.||Pradhan H.

The top managers are, by and large, left out of the control and evaluation processes. We must, therefore, search for a system which is based on a more comprehensive view of control in the sense that it takes both the strategic and the implementation aspects into account and synthesises them together to optimise the performance of the corporation as a whole.||S.

To perform this role it will be necessary for the banks to formulate their tasks in terms of annual as well as five-year plans of action. Each bank's objectives would have to be specified and a plan of action formulated in terms of potential resources and specific policy instruments. This is a specialised task and to evolve such a forward-looking development strategy, it is suggested here that each bank should create a separate Department of Planning and Development at the head office.||V.

In a country with such diverse social and economic institutions and widely divergent patterns of change in different areas it is nearly impossible to generalise. In fact for a student of land institutions in India it is too easy to be lost in a bewildering mass of diversities. Yet it might be important, from time to time, to raise one's head above the swarming details and indulge in a few generalities about the situation as a whole. At the same time one should be careful to avoid the easy way out with sweeping assertions that may fit one's a priori concepts (often borrowed from the past history of Western Europe) but are unsupported by observed data. The limited purpose of the present paper is only to bring together some of the relevant evidence now available and see if it is possible to derive some rough generalisations on the basis of it and find a coherent pattern.

06/6/1970- ||special articles||4360082||Import Substitution in Copper||This paper seeks to examine the extent and nature of import substitution in copper in the context of the operation of the world copper market. The nature of import substitution in copper is different from the usual one, viz, the substitution of imports by domestic production of the same commodity; in copper it is a case of substitution of imports by domestic production of substitute products. Import substitution of this type is important in developing economies in view of structural rigidities. Due to the operation of diminishing returns and the high capital intensity of production in the agricultural and mining sectors, certain lines of production in these sectors cannot expand as rapidly as is desired by a policy of import substitution. In such a situation, expansion of domestic production of products which substitute for the imported commodity may serve the objective of foreign exchange saving equally well.||V. A. Avadhani

Now that American withdrawal has become more likely, various historical national fears are reasserting themselves. The major consequence of this is the growing influence of China and the increasingly flexible attitude of many South-East Asian countries towards China. The traditional distrust among the Laotians, the Thais and the Vietnamese of each other all point to a possible acceptance of Chinese leadership over the area in the late seventies. In fact the only country which has historicalreasons for being wary of China is Vietnam. This could mean that the North Vietnamese are the ones who would have an interest in slowing down the growth of Chinese influence in South-East Asia, while the biggest power in the region, Thailand, would be the most likely gainer through the improvement of relations with China.||Parimal Kumar Das

26/12/1970- ||review of agriculture, december 1970||4360876||Land Reform in India and Pakistan||A general survey of land reform policy and programmes in India and Pakistan during the two decades since Independence suggests that (i) The social motivation for agrarian policy in both countries was provided by the contending pressures of the erstwhile semi-feudal landlords on the one hand and the emerging class of medium land-owners and superior tenants on the other. (ii) Within this common frame the variations between India and Pakistan were determined by the relatively greater pull of the old landed class in Pakistan and of the upper layer of the peasantry in India. (iii) In both countries the rural poor were neither articulate nor organised at the political level to exercise influence on land reform policy in their favour either at the stage of legislation or of implementation. (iv) The impact of land reform has been positive for the intermediate classes which have been upgraded and pushed into a position of prominence both in the land and the power structures. On the other hand, the impact has been by and large negative for the rural poor. Land reform has been instrumental in disturbing the old framework within which the rural poor had some security without creating for them alternative forms of security. Against this background, the increasing discontent of the rural poor provides the class motivation for a new type of land reform in the coming phase. In this new context, the scope for as well as the powerful impediments to implementing a radical land reform deserve attention. The fast increasing politicisation of the rural poor is making them deeply dissatisfied with, and intolerant of, their continuing deprivation. On the other hand, any bold initiative in the interests of the poor has to reckon now with the formidable economic power of the new landed class and the ramifications of this power in the political sphere. The resolution of these contradictory pulls is the most formidable challenge confronting political elites in the coming years. [This paper forms part of a bigger study on 'Land Reforms and Agrarian Change in India and Pakistan' done at the Asian Research Centre of the Institute of Economic Growth, Delhi.]||P. C. Joshi

On the basis of data from empirical studies of industrial workers by different researchers, the writer contends that these beliefs about the industrial workers are myths. The reality is that the industrial worker in India is predominantly urban, educated, has prior industrial experience and come largely from Hindu families, particularly of the upper castes.||Baldev R.

09/5/1970- ||special articles||4359963||Changing Contours of Right to Compensation. I||A sizeable and influential section of opinion in the country has held that the Supreme Court's judgment invalidating the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1969, is a major obstacle to implementation of socialistic measures. The wisdom of the Constitution-makers in trusting Supreme Court to review state action to ensure enforcement of fundamental rights is questioned by this section of opinion which believes that the legislature has a better title to interpret the Constitution than the judiciary. This article attempts to analyse the implications of the Supreme Court's judgment in bank nationalisation case against the background of the discussions in the Constituent Assembly on the right to compensation and the Court's earlier decisions touching on this question. The author argues that it is possible to lighten the burden of the compensation guarantee and yet comply with the basic requirements of the Constitution. Provided the principles of compensation are rationally devised, a balance can be struck between the social interest and the interest of the individual and it should not be difficult to persuade the Court that the requirements of the compensation guarantee under Article 31 (2) of the Constitution are satisfied.||Mohammed Imam

1/7/1970- ||groyth with justice||4360272||Student Discontent and Educated Unemployment||Acts of what is commonly termed student indiscipline are becoming more frequent. Indeed it is a fair guess that among all the sources of violent agitation in recent years, student dissatisfaction has been the most important. However, none of the policy conclusions that flow from the usual explanations of student unrest show any promise of successfully tackling the problem. The participants in student agitations are so varied - disproving, for instance, the assumption that the vast increase in the number of first generation students is a major cause of student violence - and the proximate causes of unrest are so many that social scientists' theories have proved to be of little predictive or prescriptive value. This article, therefore, argues for a more modest level of explanation. It suggests that the explicit purposes of the agitations be taken at face value as the more relevant explanations of why students act the way they do. Starting thus, there is considerable empirical evidence that a major reason for indiscipline is the impact of certain academic or political factors on the 'life chances' of students, especially in fields where unemployment is greatest. It may well be, insofar as educated unemployment is a cause of student unrest, that reducing the educational inflation will reduce the importance of or even eliminate one reason for agitation. It is too much to expect in a permissive society that all agitation can be ended. But what needs to be recognised is that there are many possibilities in coping with problems such as student indiscipline and educational inflation. The major need is not to explain the problem at too abstract and encompassing a level as that eliminates or reduces the possibilities of action.

The basic assumption underlying this approach is that each ethnic community, and particularly the Indian community, is solidly united because it faces its own unique problems. It is suggested in this note that while there are problems peculiar to each ethnic community in Fiji, the kind of political unity asserted or implied in the above view of Fiji politics is non-existent. The problems of Indians, for example, may possess a certain potential for creation of a political unity, but history shows that the signs of cohesion within the community have never been permanent features. The political division between the moderates and radicals within the Indian community has never been obscured, though on occasions for a short while it may have been blurred by temporary political alliances. Further, there has been a complete absence of any sectarian, kinship or marital ties across the paramount socio-political cleavage within the Indian community. It is difficult to predict the shape of future political development in independent Fiji, but if the past is capable of throwing any light on the future, it is possible to be tentatively optimistic about Fiji's racial problems and predict that ethnic barriers will continue to crumble and political progress will be towards a viable unitary society. [My thanks are due to the Australian National University for financing my field-work in Fiji on which this paper is based.

It was set up in the Second World War to satisfy the demands of the British and the American Governments which, apart from their political influence over this country, became monopoly suppliers of crucial goods. The basic framework of import control has remained the same for nearly thirty years; and what changes have been made in it have been ill-conceived, ineffective or pernicious. This paper seeks to trace the essential history of the ratarded development of import control.||Ashok V. Desai

It is argued in this paper that there are other factors at work which may be far more crucial to the success or failure of change programmes. A social system, because of the ways in which the various strata within society relate to one another and to scarce resources, may itself impede aspects of modernisation in some ways. The interactions between the village social system and the administrative bureaucracies, for instance, may tend to reinforce existing power relations and act as a brake on change. On the basis of research reported in this paper the conclusion seems inescapable that certain kinds of change cannot be carried out unless the planners and change agents themselves can be made aware of the importance of their own position and attitudes and of the ways in which these affect the development process. They have to be aware too of the kind of society they are trying to create and the long-range implications of what they are doing.||Joan P. Mencher

This article argues that this is an optimistic estimate. While the Plan claims that the estimate is based on separate estimates for individual export terms, major changes have taken place recently in the Indian economy and in worldwide trading conditions which require a reassessment of the export potential. A five per cent compound rate of growth per annum appears more feasible. With aid likely to continue at unsatisfactorily low levels, export earnings will be a crucial factor in growth. It is important, therefore, to get a more up-to-date and accurate idea of existing export possibilities, and to be aware of the policy options open which, if vigorously pursued, might yet take export earnings to the target set in the Plan.

This paper makes an attempt to examine the extent of application of quantitative methods of data collection and presentation in social science studies in India. A survey of 3907 published studies found that most of them were primarily of descriptive nature and devoid of any quantitative orientation. The relevance of both, the descriptive and the quantitative approaches, is also examined.

03/10/1970- ||special articles||4360553||Lead Banks: Action-Oriented Approach||The major action that lead banks have taken so far is to prepare Lead Bank Surveys of some of the Districts allotted to them. Quite a number of such surveys have been prepared by putting together available information about the concerned district. These surveys are indeed useful, but not much purpose would be served by designing and carrying out additional detailed surveys. The time taken would be considerable and even when the surveys are completed, they are unlikely to be action-oriented. Data-gathering should not be treated as an isolated function. In an action-oriented programme, relevant data for policy purposes should be collected as a by-product of active policies. The initial policy-frame should be prepared on the basis of available data and a personal feel for local problems and development potential. Additional information should be generated in the process of implementation of policies; otherwise data-collection would have no relevance to policies. This article is concerned with the areas of policy action that seem to be obvious on the basis of current information and analysis. The lead banks should evolve machinery for implementing these policies; in the process, new data should emerge to which policies should be adapted. Data-gathering and policies should evolve via such a process of interaction if both are to be relevant to the basic purpose of district development.||V. V. Bhatt

This article attempts to outline a method of estimating these effects. It shows, with the use of a simple model, that a reduction in the inequality of incomes will lead to an increase in the consumption of essential commodities, even when there is no rise in per capita income. A simple expression has been worked out, splitting the expected increase in consumption into two components - one reflecting the effect of growth in per capita income, and the other reflecting the effect of reduced income inequality. It also appears that, while the demand for essential commodities grows up to a defined point of income distribution, income redistribution in favour of the poor beyond that point may result in an increase in demand for non-essential items of expenditure.

The municipal governments in the Greater Calcutta region grew up originally around jute mill settlements. In spite of profound sociological and economic changes this municipal structure has remained largely static. One answer to the inadequacies of the present system may be through the development of a true metropolitan government. But this too has its special problems. The question, therefore, is how to make local government in a metropolitan set-up more purposeful. The Basic Development Plan for the Calcutta Metropolitan District has sought to formulate an answer within this framework.||Ardhendu Bhattacharya
28/3/1970- ||review of agriculture march 1970||4359787||Intra-Sectoral Dualism and Agricultural Growth||In the theories of economic growth it is now usual to refer to a dual economy, i e, an economy with an advanced or modern sector as well as with a backward sector. The situation envisaged is that the economic system of an underdeveloped country may be divided into two sectors - the advanced or modern sector, which is generally identified with the manufacturing sector, and the backward sector generally denoted by agriculture. The agricultural sector as a whole is generally equated with the backward sector. The purpose of this article is to show that it is analytically necessary, and operationally useful, to recognise that even within the backward sector there is generally a sub-sector which is modern while the other sub-sector is backward. This intra-sectoral dualism has certain important policy implications for agricultural growth. An attempt is also made here to indicate some of these implications. Although the whole situation is examined in this article against the background of Indian conditions, it is expected that the problem has a broader relevance for developing countries similarly situated.

Analysis of individualistic behaviour and divided decisions suggests that attitudinal differences among the justices account for the consistent differences noticed in the choices some of them make. Thus the judges themselves emerge as very important variables in determining the nature of the Supreme Court's decisional output. If, therefore, one wishes to acquire a better understanding of the Indian Judicial process, judges must be studied much more carefully than they have been so far.

11/7/1970- ||special articles||4360228||Modernisation of the Rice Milling Industry: Lessons from past Performance||This paper discusses the factors that determine the efficiency of the rice milling industry. It examines the performance of the traditional rice milling industry during a recent period of free trade and shows that the spread between prices of rice and paddy was well above technologically determined milling margins. There were, besides, considerable year-to-year fluctuations in the utilisation of the effective rice milling capacity. The author contends that the traditional rice milling industry has not operated efficiently. This can be attributed to various Government policies that inhibited efficient operation through their effects on choice of technology, on competition and on capacity utilisation. Government polices have encouraged expansion of antiquated hullers and discouraged modernisation, thus raising milling costs and affecting outturn. Not only have Government policies not enhanced competition but they have reduced utilisation of effective capacity through instability of price movements. The following policies seem desirable for efficient performance of the rice milling industry. First, a favourable atmosphere needs to be created which would encourage private investment in technologically superior milling equipment. Second, the need for extension of technical knowledge ought to be recognised and a positive programme adopted for making millers in the private sector aware of modern milling technology. Third, credit should be made available to millers for modernising existing rice mills so as to foster competition between those who can raise their own capital and those who for lack of capital would fail to modernise. Finally, a price policy which would stabilise off-seasonal price movements and market supplies from year to year would considerably reduce uncertainty in trading operations, thereby increasing utilisation of effective capacity and decreasing average costs and increasing competition.||Uma J.

Banks have moved beyond the stage of borrowing and lending to a situation where the emphasis is on marketing financial services. The pattern of banking is becoming more complex as new activities are added in a changing situation. The organisation of banks has, however, not kept pace with the changing tasks. Such reform as there has been has been of the piecemeal variety and has not been ahead of needs. Banks need to effect fundamental changes in their internal organisational structures if the objectivities of the new banking policy are to be achieved not merely in terms of short-term quantitative targets but also in enduring, qualitative terms. The new policy requires the creation of a new administrative framework and systematic organisational planning. The issues that arise when an endeavour is made to reorganise systematically are discussed in the following case study of a bank which we shall call the Bank of Mandovi.||Kalyan Banerji

Disparities in income and wealth in the agriculture sector would, therefore, crucially depend on how capital is distributed among the various size holdings. Consequently, those committed to an egalitarian agrarian set-up need to concentrate as much on equitable distribution of capital as on more equal distribution of land. Whether institutional credit will be made an instrument for reducing disparities in income and wealth in the agricultural sector will in fact depend finally on the awareness and bargaining power of the small and medium farmers themselves. Unfortunately, at present, their interests do not offer an attractive enough source of political power for the political parties to organise their cause. It is, therefore, necessary to start with institutions in which small farmers are likely to get a better deal. Paradoxically, the farther away the institution is situated from the village, the better the chance the small farmer stands in relation to it. Initiative from the Government and the nationalised banks with respect to the capital needs of these farmers would, indeed, be very rewarding.||C. H. Hanumantha Rao

The difference is not as mysterious as it is often made out to be. The essential difference lies in the primacy of particular role factors. The two basic principles in a Japanese organisation are (i) particularistic identification by group members with the group and (ii) diffuse and affective role expectation, of both workers and managers, within the organisation. The two between them generally connote a life-time's and total personal commitment to the organisation. Consequently, the emphasis is on commitment, promotion is by seniority, and, since the organisation is an organic whole in which the interests of each member are identified with the interests of the whole, employees tend to put up their best performance.||Koichi Niitsu

This article aims to identify the major indicators which can be a measure of the process of modernisation and to statistically enumerate those important indicators. It also attempts to answer the question of how far the forces of modernisation have affected the major States in India. A wide range of variables, pertaining to agricultural practices, industry, power, trade, transport, commerce, communications, education, housing, etc, were selected for studying their trends and intercorrelations, though some of the variables had to be dropped because of paucity of data. The study demonstrates that on the basis of available State-level statistical indicators, it is possible to discover a common factor which can be defined as 'modernisation', and that States can then be ranked according to their relative degree of modernisation.||V.

It is treated as a sort of a clearing house, having no potentiality of its own. In interpreting politics within this frame, some scholars attribute to caste the quality of "resilience" or the capability to adjust itself to political circumstances without losing its own identity. In doing so, these scholars miss an important point-that politics is also an independent variable, having the potentiality to influence the social system. Politics generates conflicts over interests, power, distribution of benefits and so on, which disrupt caste-cohesiveness because a caste-group is heterogeneous with differences within it of status and economic interests. Politics also cuts across primordial loyalties and gives rise to new groups. However, the role of politics should not be overemphasised. Caste has its own dynamics. What has to be emphasised is the interaction process between caste and politics, each influencing the other. The Chhata constituency in Uttar Pradesh highlights this process from one election to another. The following case study focuses on changes in group-alliances and their role in elections. This is not a study of 'voting behaviour' concerned with intentions and actual voting at the individual level.

The purpose of this article is to highlight some of the findings of the latter year. Doubts about the HYV Programme usually relate to its more limited spread among tenants and small holders as against among owners and larger holders, its dependence on timely supply of inputs such as water, fertiliser and pesticide, and the coverage and quality of extension services for it. Analysis of PEO's findings for wheat, paddy and jowar in their three respectively major producing areas indicates that, though there is some basis, on these scores, for reservations about the success of the programme, there are other pointers to factors that are already making for - and could make for further - success of the Programme.||P.

15/8/1970- ||special articles||4360330||The Reconstituted UGC||The initial impulse for the recent amendment of the UGC Act came from a feeling held by some, and possibly shared by the Union Ministry of Education, that the Centre ought to have a greater voice in the field of higher and professional education. The proposal to put higher education on the Concurrent list did not eventually get accepted. Given the political situation in the country, this was not an entirely unexpected development. Consequently, in this respect the situation today is what it was in 1963 before the Sapru Committee on Higher Education, which had recommended that higher education should be put on the Concurrent list, was appointed. The only good thing that came out of the recommendations of the Sapru Committee was its proposal to streamline and strengthen the UGC. The new UGC Act seeks to achieve this objective. In order to see to what extent this objective will be achieved, two issues need to be considered: (a) the composition and functioning of the UGC in terms of the amended Act; and (b) the social and political situation in the country in which the UGC has to operate.||Amrik Singh

On the basis of his researches the author maintains that history offers no ground for such a generalisation. This article attempts to provide a corrective to the prevailing belief among both scholars and laymen that 19th century Indian social history, for some only in relation to the Hindus, offers a record of reformism.||Sudhir Chandra

It is slowly dawning on the analysts, however, that it is the spread of benefits or the relative deprivation which is significant to stability, not the level of affluence of the society as a whole. It is therefore being gradually recognised that social justice - as revealed in the distribution patterns of goods and services - is indeed one of the more important variables intervening in the postulated relationships between growth and stability. The Indian Government currently tends to shy away from recognising that the pattern of distribution of gains may lie at the root of today's political instability. The widening cleavages - social, political, and economic - are in part, at least, the consequences of Government policies though they may not have been anticipated. It is the movements that these policies have generated in hitherto relatively static structures that have contributed to the acceleration of demands and led to the polarisation of those demands in the 'Right reactionaries' and the 'Left adventurists'. This polarisation is now posing threats of upheaval on a national scale. But both poles have their wider usefulness. For, by unmasking the continuing imperfections of our society, and by the very success of their psychological appeal, they draw attention to hitherto concealed areas of anxiety and stress. In this sense they perform the function of political intelligence, isolating the areas of potential concern and danger and providing cues to policy areas ripe for innovation aimed at creative resolution of deeply felt frustrations. The rub in taking any such action, however, lies in the fact that the representatives of the people are not drawn from among the masses, but are themselves part of the social elite. The failure to come to grips with and articulate the more basic and disturbing conflicts in society may thus represent the inability of the establishment to appropriately relocate the national image and self in the milieu of revolutionary changes in aspirations that are taking place. The polity, in fact, appears to be more than ready to absorb radical structural change. Much has been made of rapid social change and accompanying instability. But it seems more likely that more purposive social change, rather than less, is needed to avoid a paralysing instability.||Satish K. Arora

28/3/1970- ||review of agriculture march 1970||4359788||Agriculture in India in the 1970s||There is sufficient experience with the new agricultural strategy now to ask how green is the 'Green Revolution' and whether it is a 'revolution' or merely a small 'palace revolt'. Answers to these questions are a necessary prelude to examination of the demand and supply situation for agricultural products in the 1970s. India could easily end up as importer of 10 mn tonnes of cereal grains by 1980 or suffer the consequences of sharply rising prices if this level of imports did not obtain in the absence of a sharply accelerated and sustained rate of growth in foodgrain production. Considering all that is required to get rapid agricultural development, the Fourth-Year Plan (Draft) does not seem to accord agriculture the priority necessary to achieve this high rate of increase in production. Thus, unless the priorities are changed and changed quickly, another food crisis looms on the horizon for the latter part of the 1970s. Much more remains to be done to adapt the new seed technology to Indian conditions, particularly in rice, where a significant increase in production is yet to take place. But possibly more important, because it will not be easy to come by, is the tremendous investment that must be made in the development of water resources and the elimination of the institutional biases against the small cultivator. It is only when these things are done in adequate measure that the base will be laid for diffusion of the new technology. In addition, there are more than ample opportunities to employ the underemployed and unemployed in the rural areas on well-conceived and well-managed projects of labour intensive forms of capital creation to sustain a rapid pace of rural development that has a tolerable degree of equity in the distribution of benefits of progress. Unless this is achieved, the social and political tensions that have been building up in the countryside for some time, and have been made more acute by the stark visibility of the uneven impact of the new seed-fertiliser technology, could play havoc with the whole development process.||Martin E.

28/3/1970- ||review of agriculture march 1970||4359791||Opportunities in the Green Revolution||Two opposite views have crystallised in the current debate on the indirect effects of the "new agricultural policy". According to one of these views, the policy is responsible for widening the gap, and for the growing polarisation, between the rich and the poor. The second view on the other hand holds that the most important indirect effect of the new policy has been the hastening of the process of modernisation of agriculture. The purpose of this paper is to examine these two views and to delineate the opportunities offered by the green revolution by placing it in the perspective of inter-sectoral relationships in a developing economy. It will be argued that the "second generation" problems, of which equity is a major one, are transitory problems if the significance of the green revolution is recognised and the opportunities thrown up by it are appropriately exploited. It will also be argued that modernisation of agriculture in terms of use of new inputs alone is in effect a limited and partial modernisation.

It therefore becomes pertinent to know to what extent the associated practices have become a part of farming activity. The following article is based on a survey conducted among the farmers of Burdwan district by the Agro-Economic Research Centre, Visva-Bharati, Santiniketan. The survey was conducted with the object of finding out to what extent the green revolution has touched the district and the particular form it has taken there. The idea was to arrive at estimates of the various measures of agricultural enterprise among farmers belonging to different classes defined on the basis of production relations. In the course of the analysis, by different indicators of enterprise and by different size-groups and occupations, no particular class of so-called 'progressive farmers' or 'capitalist farmers' could be located; nor were there signs of semi-feudal relations in agriculture being strengthened. What emerged-and needs to be more deeply tested-is that farming is still within a traditional framework of practices and the latest technology has entered that framework but failed to make any major impact on it. None of the customarily associated attributes of the latest technology-such as large holding-size, intense use of fertiliser, calculated water management, use of improved seed varieties-constitutes an essential part of the practices of those who are extracting the most out of every given acre of land. It appears that, in a predominantly small-cum-tenant farming and water-scarcity situation, expansion efforts are reaching saturation point. Without tackling these constraints, a green revolution cannot be wished in. [The Agro-Economic Research Centre is particularly grateful to Ashok Rudra, its Technical Adviser, for his guidance of the project at different stages.]||

Over the period 1951-68 both components of the physical volume of bank debits, viz, the number of cheques cleared through clearing houses and the remaining debits, show a high degree of stability in their rate of growth. There is no macro-variable in the economy or micro-variable in the banking system which shows such a high degree of stability in its growth rate. The results presented in this paper need to be further examined and compared with experience in other countries before one can properly understand their implications.

The author suggests that in the favourable circumstances then prevailing, a modern ship-building industry should have been the natural outcome of Parsi enterprise but for the hostility of the then ruling power which by discouraging the incipient ship-building and navigation industry halted and distorted a potential industrialisation process. The growth of the Parsi ship-building industry during this period did not take place in a vacuum. It had the congenial environment of overall, multi-dimensional progress of the Parsi community. Even finance, without which no potential industry could have made any advance, was becoming highly organised and was abundant. At the same time, the Parsis were prudent enough to avoid competition with the British. They collaborated with British agency houses as brokers or junior partners or as both. They entered into a symbiotic patron-client relationships with the British. Every Parsi millionaire had one or two British patrons. The former lent their money, the latter their imposing names and this worked remarkably well in the colonial business world. The Parsis also found it convenient to put Europeans in charge of their ships. Further, the practice, which was almost customary with the Parsis, of apprenticing their wards with European firms further strengthened their ties with the British business community. The Parsi business community thus emerged as a comprador capitalist class right from its origin. In fields ranging from supply of cotton to the British textile industry to distributing British manufactures all over northern, central and southern India and the marketing of contraband opium from China, their role was crucially useful to British interests. Shipping was, however, the one exception; here the initial success of the Parsis in developing an indigenous shipping industry was definitely frowned upon by the British. [H Rairkar prepared a card index of names and other antecedents of all Indian ships mentioned in the relevant documents for the period for my use. This was helpful for cross-checking information obtained from diverse sources.]||Amalendu Guha
26/12/1970- ||review of agriculture, december 1970||4360875||Agricultural Growth in the 1970s: An Analysis||In order to achieve the Fourth Five-Year Plan target of growth of agricultural output by 5 per cent annually during the Plan period and the rest of the 1970s, the rate of increase in productivity of croplands will have to be higher than the rate envisaged in the Plan. This is because the Plan's projection of increase in the gross cropped area appears to be too high on analysis of both past trends in growth of the area and future possibilities of extension of cultivation and increase in multi-cropping. For achievement of a high average rate of increase in productivity, significant increase in the rate is essential in the States, mostly of eastern and north-central India, in which it was lower than the all-India average of 1.77 per cent during 1952-53 to 1964-65. These States account for more than half of both total cropped area and value of agricultural output of the country. Low rates of productivity increase in them are not due to physical handicaps, but appear to be related to socio-economic factors: levels of economic development and of modernisation of agriculture are lower in most of them than in the States with relatively high rates of increase in productivity. Significant reduction of inter-State differences in agricultural progress does not appear likely however from analysis of recent trends in modernisation of agriculture, the pattern of public sector outlays under the Fourth Plan on agriculture, irrigation, rural electrification and related programmes or from targets of important Plan programmes such as HYVP. The specific causes of slow agricultural progress should be indentified separately for each lagging State and region and appropriate remedial measures should be taken. But there are some common elements which point to the need for similar measures in most States. First, since unirrigated rice is the principal cereal crop in most of the States, intensive research and extension efforts aimed at evolving and spreading rapidly high-yielding varieties of unirrigated rice are needed. Second, the socio-institutional handicaps of these states, arising from prevalence of zamindari or other feudalistic land tenure systems over large areas until the early 1950s, and/or inclusion of large areas in backward princely States in the pre-Independence period have not been entirely overcome. The remedial measures should include besides needed land reforms, accelerated development of social services and infrastructures and strengthening of developmental institutions. The regional aspect of agricultural growth has not received adequate attention; its analysis and formulation of suitable programmes to accelerate growth in the lagging regions is a necessary corollary to the high areal selectivity of the agricultural strategy of the Fourth Plan.

26/12/1970- ||review of agriculture, december 1970||4360881||Fertiliser Application on High-Yielding Varieties||Application of chemical fertilisers was confined till recently to one or two major foodgrain crops and a few commercial crops raised mainly under irrigation. The reasons for such restricted use were partly economic and partly sociological. The earlier varieties of crops were not very responsive to fertiliser application, and the crop-fertiliser price ratios were generally unfavourable so that returns on fertiliser application were not attractive. At the same time, the tradition-bound farmers were not enthusiastic about introducing new inputs the potentials of which were not fully known to them, and the preference was for time-honoured organic manures. There were also social prejudices against the use of chemical fertilisers on food crops. The new high-yielding varieties changed the prospect, since these varieties were highly responsive to fertiliser application. Consumption of fertiliser increased considerably, and gradually there has been growing acceptance of the fact that fertiliser application is the best single index of the level of agricultural development and that the attainment of Fourth Plan targets depends largely on the application of this key input. The purpose of this article is to find out, for a few selected wheat growing areas, whether the actual fertiliser use on HYV wheat has been above or below the recommended doses, and in the case of a lower dose to discover what factors are responsible and what measures would be corrective.

The Indian Council of Social Science Research has been established about two decades after India gained political freedom. During these years the democratic political spectrum has changed basically and the structure of personnel and of the cultural environment of the universities has also considerably changed. These factors need to be borne in mind in any proper evaluation of the organisation and functions of ICSSR. While the establishment of ICSSR marks a new recognition of the role of the social sciences in national life, its success would lie in the extent to which it comes to symbolise a new professional consciousness. In this direction, with its present organisation, ICSSR faces many dilemmas.||Yogendra Singh

The split within Congress illustrates a type of freedom and release which represents possibilities of genuine political creation. But the irrelevance of political party programmes and inability to impose sanctions against those who manoeuvre opportunistically from party to party have served to devalue all parties and, much more important, to unmask their ideological pretences. With the acceleration of this process, the very legitimacy of the political system as operated through the party system may be called into question. What is at stake is the future not so much of Congress party as of the political system as a whole. If disenchantment deepens alternative paths to acquisition and consolidation of political power will gain support. That there is a political payoff in recourse to extra-parliamentary activity has been already established. Such activity may well become a dominant mode of political expression in the decade we have just entered.||Satish K. Arora

Broadly, the present study confirms the major trends forecast by the February study, but with two exceptions. First, foodgrains production, it now appears, will be marginally higher than originally anticipated. Secondly, the rate of growth of industrial production is likely to be slightly lower.

But there are cases of non-co-operation among well owners and this often leads to over-investment in lift-irrigation machinery, viz, to more than one pumpset in a single well.

05/12/1970- ||special articles||4360789||Long Way to Development of Nagaland||Like other hill areas of the country, Nagaland too has a favourable land-man ratio, social ownership of property, over-dependence on agriculture, primitive techniques of production, poor facilities for education and health, lack of monetisation, and very limited financial resources available for economic development. Until recently, little attention was paid to the socio-economic development of Nagaland-except by Christian missionaries who, besides proselytising, also did much to improve educational, health and medical facilities in the region. Since production in Nagaland is geared largely for unit consumption, and since monetisation is limited, it is difficult to find the necessary financial resources for development. Till such time, therefore, as the territory's economy becomes self-generating in growth, developmental resources will have to come from outside Nagaland. In addition, alternative schemes will have to be formulated to release and harness for other economic activities some of the labour force from agriculture. And, to promote the alternative economic pursuits, an infrastructure consisting largely of adequate communication and road transport will have to be built up. An analysis of the capital outlays in Nagaland's Fourth Five-Year Plan reveals that, to effectively bring self-generating growth to the region, the Plan will have to be strengthened and schemes formulated with a view to obtaining the maximum inflow of revenues in the coming years.||H.

Specific instances such as the allocation of subsidies for the digging of wells and the introduction of intensive agricultural programmes are used as illustrations to highlight the various factors which operate in the decision-making process. Group politics plays a large part in the distribution of scarce resources in the face of many demands. In this process the President of the Panchayat Samithi and the Block Development Officer are the key figures. This paper is based on data collected by the author in two districts of Andhra Pradesh during 1963-65 and 1967-68.||G. Ram Reddy

16/5/1970- ||special articles||4359988||Changing Contours of Right to Compensation. II||A sizeable and influential section of opinion in the country has held that the Supreme Court's judgment invalidating the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of Undertakings) Act, 1969, is a major obstacle to implementation of socialistic measures. The wisdom of the Constitution-makers in trusting Supreme Court to review state action to ensure enforcement of fundamental rights is questioned by this section of opinion which believes that the legislature has a better title to interpret the Constitution than the judiciary. This article attempts to analyse the implications of the Supreme Court's judgment in bank nationalisation case against the background of the discussions in the Constituent Assembly on the right to compensation and the Court's earlier decisions touching on this question. The author argues that it is possible to lighten the burden of the compensation guarantee and yet comply with the basic requirements of the Constitution. Provided the principles of compensation are rationally devised, a balance can be struck between the social interest and the interest of the individual and it should not be difficult to persuade the Court that the requirements of the compensation guarantee under Article 31(2) of the Constitution are satisfied. In the first part of the article, which appeared last week, the author reviewed the discussions in the Constituent Assembly on the scope of the compensation guarantee. In this, the second and final part, he discusses different views on compensation as reflected in Supreme Court judgments.||Mohammed Imam

In the absence of these data, an attempt has been made here to provide a framework of factual information which can be subjected to further analysis. This covers career aspirations, job preferences, salary expectations, commitment to engineering, career ambitions, plans on graduating of an 88 per cent sample of student engineers graduating from one IIT in 1970. The paper raises a number of issues of relevance to manpower planners as also to policy-makers in higher technical education.

It concludes that the burden of direct taxes seems high on the agricultural sector, but by taking into account income per capita, the direct tax burden is relatively less on the agricultural sector as compared to the non-agricultural sector. The burden of indirect taxes is also quite heavy on the non-agricultural sector as compared to the agricultural sector. The data on the combined burden of taxes - direct and indirect - on the two sectors also support the fact that the agricultural sector is relatively lightly taxed compared to the non-agricultural sector. Thus the study reinforces the common belief that the agricultural sector is relatively undertaxed in Rajasthan, and could rationally be taxed more.||A. C. Angrish

27/6/1970- ||review of management, june 1970||4360166||Water Management in the Seventies||The problem of managing water as an agricultural input - along with good seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and mechanisation - is essentially that of effecting a change from the traditional to the modern. Against the traditional approach of using often scanty supplies of irrigation water as "something wet to put on a field", modern water management covers the integrated processes of canal intake, conveyance, regulation, measurement, distribution and use of water on farms as well as removal of excess water from farms in proper amounts and at the right time to ensure maximum crop production and water economy. Intensification of agriculture through use of high-yielding varieties and fertilisers results in more exacting demands as to timing and amounts of water to meet the increased moisture stress in plants at critical growth periods. Irrigation projects of the future should, therefore, provide for delivery systems which are "controllable" with respect to their capability to deliver water when needed. Also, ground-water development should generally be integrated with surface water development to provide a comprehensive system. Economies in the use of irrigation water should be a "built-in" feature of future development of irrigation. In essence this means careful selection of soil to be irrigated, cropping patterns with appropriate mixes of high and low water stress crops, methods of irrigation adapted to soil characteristics, slope, crop type and climatic factors, efficient delivery systems, minimisation of evaporation, timing of irrigation to suit crop stages and control of acquatic weeds. To achieve these objectives it will be necessary to pre-plan the interrelated features of agricultural production and engineering through a multi-discipline approach. Agriculture and irrigation are State Government functions and not until States adopt and implement policies of modernising water distribution and application systems for efficient crop production will there be significant motivation for intensification of agricultural production. Perhaps the studies underway by the Irrigation Commission will focus attention on the need for organisational adjustments at State and Central Government levels to more adequately meet the challenges of efficient water management.

1/7/1970- ||groyth with justice||4360271||Unemployment in India in Perspective||In discussions of economic policies calculated to achieve social justice, much emphasis is understandably laid on the provision of a minimum level of income to all. In this context, the unemployed, who are presumed to be without any source of support, attract prime attention. The question arises as to what is the number of unemployed persons in the country. Until recently the Planning Commission used to provide estimates of unemployment. The term "backlog of unemployment", initially coined by the Commission to reckon the number of additional jobs required to be created during the Second Plan to eradicate unemployment within ten years-the optimistic goal to which Government had committed itself in the mid-fifties-, has become the focal point of many studies. The number of unemployed in the country was estimated in various Plan documents to have increased from 5.3 million at the end of the First Plan to between 9 and 10 million at the end of the Third Plan. Of the total unemployed in 1966, three-fourths were believed to be in the rural areas. The Planning Commission set up an Expert Committee in August 1968 to examine its own estimates of unemployment, the underlying methodology and related issues. The Fourth Plan Document, published recently, reports that the Expert Committee on Unemployment Estimates has advised the Planning Commission to give up its uni-dimensional estimates of labour force, additional employment generated and backlog of unemployment. Yet, the ghost of estimates of backlog of unemployment continues to haunt the Indian economic scene and speeches by leaders of industry and writings of economic journalists continue to depict awesome pictures of this monster. This article attempts to (a) examine the concepts and methodology underlying the Planning Commission's estimates of unemployment, and (b) discuss available empirical data on unemployment and underemployment.||Pravin Visaria

It is the fifth, if one includes also the quite valuable regional planning work that has centred on two other urban areas, Mysore and Kanpur. The Bombay Metropolitan Regional Planning Board thus had a great deal to go on by way of precedent. This is what makes the Board's work, as represented by its "Report on the Draft Regional Plan of Bombay Metropolitan Region, 1970-71", particularly disappointing. The Report has only one tooth in an otherwise toothless face. Though armed with wide powers for staffing, the Board chose to work through a collection of eight "Study Groups" which consisted of casual members, all with other full-time professional preoccus parties. The reports of these Study Groups were assembled to ultimately form chapters of the Board's Final Report. No less unfortunate than the Board's choice of working methods was its failure to take advantage of the experience and talent available from earlier city planning efforts. At every stage, the Board glosses over major issues or dodges them altogether. The question of migration into Bombay is neatly side-stepped by making three series of population projections; the task assessing the cost of executing the Regional Plan is not even attempted; and problems of implementation are evaded. There is only one recommendation which has any real significance and this is the proposal that a new metro-centre, or twin city, be established on the mainland across the harbour from Bombay. The significance of the recommendation has been heightened by the fact that the State Government has accepted the proposal with remarkable speed and even initiated action on it. A new corporation has been formed and entrusted with the task of detailed planning and development of the trans-harbour area and 55,000 acres of land in the area have been already notified for acquisition. Planning work is to begin shortly and, if all goes well, we can expect vigorous activity and perhaps a flourishing settlement in that area before the next five years are out. However, the establishment of the twin city raises some fundamental issues. It is necessary that these are thoroughly examined at the inception of the project.||Shirish B. Patel

Profit levels are now rapidly recovering to satisfactory levels. Structural adjustment is being slowed down by restrictions on import of equipment and technology, but it could still proceed at a respectable pace. The chief bottle-neck is, however, likely to be the balance of payments position, which will become so difficult in the next two or three years as to rule out industrial growth at more than 5 per cent per annum.||Ashok V.

The decision of the Supreme Court in this case takes the country back to the position that obtained before the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution. It repudiates whatever was discussed and thought proper in the Constituent Assembly and in Parliament over the last 20 years. By the bank nationalisation judgment, taken together with the judgment in the Golaknath case three years ago, the Supreme Court has made virtually impossible the implementation of a policy to which Parliament, consisting of the elected representatives of the people, is pledged. To permit the present decision to remain as the law of the land would mean giving the Courts a power that would block any possibility of building a socialist economy within the framework of the present Constitution.||S.

27/6/1970- ||review of management, june 1970||4360169||Tenancy in a Dynamic Setting||The tenant is taken, by researchers as well as by policy-makers, to be a small, ill-equipped farmer, rack-rented and otherwise exploited by the landowner. There is much validity in this description of landowner-tenant relations in a stagnant, traditional agrarian system. But once this situation changes and some dynamism is injected into the agricultural sector, this description and the policy prescription implicit in it - abolition of tenancy - are no longer valid. This study based on a survey of four Gujarat villages - two commercialised villages of central Gujarat and two relatively backward villages of north Gujarat - shows that though tenancy in most forms is illegal in Gujarat (as it is in most other States), it is widespread in the State and covers a significant proportion of land cultivated. The extent of tenancy is larger in the more commercialised areas and there is a marked skewness in the distribution of land. The present irregular tenancy arrangement causes more hardship for the small farmer who wants to augment his holding by taking small bits of land on lease. The big farmer desirous of taking land on lease seems to be doing so with impunity. There are thus two lease markets operating side by side: one characterised by leasers' hegemony (when big farmers are tenants) and the other distinguished by the hold of the lesors (on small tenant farmers). Due to the functioning of this two-market system, the terms available to the small tenant farmer have become more onerous. But in spite of these handicaps, small tenant farmers have proved to be more capable resource-users and obtain higher return from a rupee's investment. The major policy recommendations that seems to emerge from this study are: (i) Leasing-in of land by small farmers should be permitted while totally and effectively prohibiting leasing-in by large farmers. (ii) The terms of tenancy should be made more realistic, taking into account the fact that not only land but other inputs are also likely to be shared between the landlord and the tenant. Merely giving such arrangements the label of "crop-sharing" and condemning them in a righteous vein will not solve the problem. (iii) Tenancy agreements should be made through some institutional agency to safeguard against arbitrary interpretation by landlords or tenants. (iv) On any such agency tenants should be fully represented. Much damage has been done to the poorer section in the countryside by arrangements based on the assumption that the administrators or the peoples' representatives act in a neutral, objective and fair manner. An open and regulated tenancy can be made to serve the interests of the small farmer in a more effective way than ineffective abolition of tenancy. It can also make possible, for at least some of them, an advance on the agricultural ladder.||V. S. Vyas

Nor are planned creation of adequate international liquidity and a satisfactory adjustment process for fundamental disequilibria sufficient conditions for smooth working of the international monetary system. So long as gold, foreign exchange reserves, and SDRs continue to operate side by side, and so long as monetary authorities set store by gold as the final repository of value, it is quite likely that crises of confidence will occur as in the past. The international monetary system will then be rendered unstable once again by switches among the reserve assets. This article argues that unless member countries of the Fund agree to convert their present gold reserves into SDRs and undertake to centralise purchase and sale of gold in the Fund to maintain the floor price, the present two-tier system may yet prove vulnerable.||V.

This paper suggests that such socio-economic data on IIT students have relevance for other issues in science policy and manpower planning, such as the function believed to be served by the education of high-level technical manpower, industrial policy and location, problems of brain drain in science and technology and regional disparities in industrial growth rates. The analysis of the data has also relevance for educational policy-making at the Institutes of Technology. [The author is grateful to V K Jolly for his assistance in computing the statistics.]||A. D.

30/5/1970- ||review of management, may 1970||4360049||Decision Analysis: Experiences and Expectations||Are the days of management by hunch over? Does a formal approach to managerial problems exclude judgment of experienced executives? In the process of answering these questions an attempt is made to discuss the role of decision analysis in managerial problems. Empirical studies covering pricing, bidding and investment decisions are discussed as illustrative cases. It is pointed out that decision analysis, in no instance, rules out the judgment of the executive. On the contrary, it builds on such judgments and the decision-maker's preferences for results. The approach suggested by decision analysis is particularly useful in complex problems. In future, as the complexities increase, far greater would be the need for such an analysis.||V. L. Mote,M.

16/5/1970- ||special articles||4359987||Investment in Agriculture: A Cost-Benefit Analysis||In a recent article in the Reserve Bank of India Bulletin (January, 1970), V M Jakhade and M V Gadgil have furnished some valuable data on costs and returns relating to farm investments in five districts selected from four States. The purpose of their study was to examine, from the viewpoint of commercial banks which are expected to finance this activity, the economic feasibility of investments in wells, pumps and tractors and the repayment capacity of the farmers undertaking these investments. The cost-benefit analysis done by Jakhade and Gadgil would lead one to the conclusion that in a surprisingly large number of cases, investments in wells, pumps and tractors were not economically worthwhile in the districts surveyed. If banks were asked to finance these investments, they would tend to reject many of these projects on economic grounds. Yet we know that there has been a boom in these investments. Are the farmers irrational? Or is the Reserve Bank study in error? It is argued below that it is the Reserve Bank study which is at fault, both in terms of its objectives and approach, and that if banks are asked to follow the criterion of project feasibility proposed in the study, the interests of neither private nor social welfare will be served.||Samuel Paul

28/2/1970- ||special articles||4359678||Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act||The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act passed by Parliament incorporates all the amendments suggested by the Joint Select Committee of Parliament. None of the changes made by the Select Committee was of a basic nature. The majority of them related to definitions of terms and concepts; and, of these, only a few made any significant difference. For the rest, the three most important changes made by the Committee were: (i) specification of a time-schedule to ensure expeditious disposal of cases related to concentration; (ii) vesting of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission with power to initiate investigation into monopolistic practices; and, (iii) change of criteria of public interest for justification of restrictive trade practices. Parliament took no less than two-and-a-half years to pass the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Bill. The Select Committee itself took 15 months to submit its report. Unfortunately, neither the Committee's report, nor the 12 minutes of dissent appended to it, gave much indication of any serious homework having been done or even of any attempt to get the benefit of available expertise on the subject in the country. As a result, most of the major shortcomings of the Bill were left untouched and have now become a part of the Act. The Select Committee, no less than those responsible for drafting the Bill, failed to anticipate the administrative problems of enforcing this ambitious piece of legislation. Little attention was, therefore, paid to the provisions of the Bill dealing with the procedures and machinery for administering the law. Similarly, neither at the stage of drafting the Bill nor during the long months that elapsed between its introduction and enactment, did Government give any thought to the need to reconcile the provisions of this legislation with Government's other economic policies But it is not Government and Parliament alone that deserve to be blamed. Though this piece of legislation will affect almost every section of industry and trade and though it was before Parliament for so long a time, the business community, professional lawyers and economists made little effort to provoke intelligent discussion on its content and possible consequences. [The author's detailed, clause-by-clause critique of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Bill appeared in the January 1969 Annual Number of this journal (pp 91-102). In this article the author comments mainly on the amendments made in the Bill by the Select Committee and incorporated in the Act.]||A. N. Oza

18/4/1970- ||special articles||4359881||China's Foreign Policy in the Seventies||No policy-maker in Peking looks forward to the seventies as a decade without the Americans in Asia. A major factor in China's foreign policy will remain the continued presence of American power in Asia, possibly all through the decade. China's policy will be thus largely a response to American moves. Though China talks of 'American imperialism' as a paper-tiger, it has in fact been very cautious vis-a-vis US. At times it has shown itself ready to make major concessions in order to normalise relations with US. In the seventies China will continue its efforts to talk to US and, as China's nuclear power grows, these efforts might yield more tangible results than in the last two decades. The status of Formosa is likely to be the main bone of contention between China and US. China has made it clear that Formosa's integration with China is a primary condition for normalisation of relations with US. However, this heavy emphasis on Formosa has in fact narrowed down Sino-American differences. The other power with which China would be concerned in Asia in the seventies is Japan. Here, too, one gets the feeling that China's worries spring mainly from Japanese interests in Formosa. As for relations with Soviet Union, it is unlikely that China will take the initiative to turn the border dispute into a hot war because this will bind its hands in the north while the real struggle is in the south. Second, China's interest in national liberation struggles will be very indirect but very active. This may present some problems for Moscow in its dealings with governments such as those of Thailand and Malaysia. Finally, China is unlikely to be very vocal in its criticism of possible pro-Moscow leaderships in Hanoi and Pyongyang. China's attitude to India will be determined, as it is now, by its world view. To put it simply, China finds India far too dependent on US and USSR to think that any meaningful dialogue would be possible. The seventies will show whether India will get itself involved in a cold war with the Chinese (in fact, with Asia's communists in general) or whether it will muster some courage in its dealings with the super powers. There are no indications yet of what will happen, but one thing seems fairly certain - unless India is seen to begin to face this challenge, China will remain cold and hostile.||G. P. Deshpande

28/11/1970- ||review of management, november 1970||4360761||Development Strategy for Electronics Industry: Ensuring Success of Technological Innovation||In an industry like electronics where technological changes are rapid, the demand of strategic self-sufficiency great and the current dependence on imported manufacturing technology acute, we just must devise ways and means of ensuring that the resources committed to domestic design and development pay off commercially. If we are to have any chance at all of achieving this goal, it is imperative that we accept the need for a fundamental change in the conceptual framework, the institutional forms and the executive procedures within which we have been attempting to pursue research and development in electronics. Such a change must arise primarily from the recognition that neither the performance of design and development work nor the mere setting up of manufacturing activities using imported technology are sufficient conditions for success. The focus has to shift to conceptualising, institutionalising and implementing technological innovation in electronics as a total process. The need to produce 'technological innovation' poses a basic challenge to our electronics industry-that of learning the behavioural, institutional, technical, economic and managerial intricacies of this process and applying the understanding so acquired in the policy-making and executive arenas or giving up altogether the resolve to develop an autonomous industry.||A.

During the 1960s the country witnessed perhaps a larger number of communal riots than ever before. The September-October 1969 riots in Gujarat were the most violent in the series. The Gujarat riots, though an echo of trouble elsewhere in the country, were also a consequence of problems peculiar to Gujarat. An attempt is made in this article to reconstruct the story of the riots and their background. [This article is a report on a short and preliminary investigation undertaken by the author as part of a larger programme of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi, on 'Sectors of Stress in Indian Politics'. It is intended to follow this up with a more rigorous study. The Centre has also undertaken a major study of Muslims in contemporary India which will include several case studies of affected areas. The author is greatly indebted to Rajni Kothari and other colleagues at the Centre for their valuable comments and suggestions. The responsibility for the present report is, of course, entirely the author's.]||Ghanshyam Shah

In view of their negotiability, the CDs are likely to be acceptable particularly to large business corporations, mutual funds, trusts, local authorities, municipalities, etc, who could thus invest their temporary idle funds. Further, the CDs would provide banks with an opportunity to tap additional sources of funds by offering attractive rates of interest. [This article represents the personal views of the author.]||M.

21/2/1970- ||special articles||4359646||National Integration and Communal Violence||Current discussions on national integration betray the basically false presumption that India has always been a nation in the most modern sense of the term. Yet Indian nationalism as reflected in the freedom struggle was the expression of the desire of people living in different parts of the land to snatch their destiny from foreign hands. As the need to mobilise larger and larger segments of population grew in the minds of the national movement leadership, the political platform went on broadening, with Hindu-Muslim unity being made the cornerstone of the national movement and Harijan uplift being consciously taken up. Yet Independence came before the process of integration could be in fact completed. And tragically, soon after Independence, the leaders generally forgot that efforts at integration needed to be continued. The need for such an effort was realised after the first major post-Independence communal riot at Jabbalpur. The National Integration Council was formed at the official level to attempt such an integration, but the Council remained disused most of the time. It took another spate of riots in 1967-68 to call for a revival of the Council. By this time communal forces had become popular and respectable enough to command influence and position in the Council itself. Till today, therefore, the Council has failed to identify the parties and organisations that propagate communal ideas. On the other hand, the other trend, which took nationalism as the heritage of the past, grew stronger. As a rider to this, grew the mistaken belief that those who do not opt for a Common Civil Code and merge with the majority are communalists. This article argues, in the light of an analysis of the Ahmedabad riots, that communal tension and riots are a symptom of lack of integration, not factors leading to disintegration.||D. R. Goyal

1/7/1970- ||politics of business||4360276||How to Get on in Japanese Business (If You Are a Japanese)||Progressive Japanese business ideology emphasises sales or absence of labour disputes rather than just profit on capital invested as the criteria of efficiency. This creates a tendency to excessive competition, kata kyoso, as firms maintain high levels of production even when, from a strictly profit-maximisation point of view, a lower level of operation may be justified. Though often tough-minded and ruthless, no Japanese manager will put forward the view that what is good for his firm is also automatically good for Japanese society and state. Japanese managers would instead argue that by using their firms to support their workers, they are trying to take over from society some of its responsibilities for supporting these workers and that they are, therefore, acting as agents of the state. Japanese capitalists accept the right of the state to control business firms in the national interest (though, of course, they often regard some of the state's actions as misguided). They hold that the state represents all Japanese just as a business firm represents all its employees and that both are, therefore, the same kind of organisation basically. This ideological identity between the state and business is strengthened by two other tendencies: (a) The Liberal Democratic Party controls the state and such conflicts as may occur between Government policy and private business are often ironed out through the party organisation. (b) The patterns of bureaucratic organisation in large business firms and in Government are similar and, as they gradually move up in private business or Government administration, the graduates of the elite universities retain their alumni links and connections with one another. This article discusses how all this works out in practice. The author presents a basic model to which, he thinks, Japanese business organisation conforms and then examines the operation of the model in business and in society in general.||W. H. Newell
1/1/1970- ||future of aid||4359554||Aid Models and Inflows of Foreign Aid||The features of the economic situation that aid models abstract from are more important in explaining, predicting or prescribing for economic growth in India than the features that they capture. These models treat foreign capital as perfectly malleable although they recognise the non-shiftability of domestic capital. The malleability of foreign capital is impaired not only by the imperfections of the 'market' for foreign loans and grants but also by prescription of the form in which foreign capital is to be imported, the country from which it is to be imported and the project for which it is to be used. Fundamentally, aid models fail as predictive or prescriptive devices because they are based on an erroneous, if skeletal, theory of economic growth. The average propensity to save in underdeveloped countries cannot be increased just by raising average per capita income. Nor can a higher rate of investment in itself lead to self-sustained economic growth. Productivity of capital, land and labour must be increased through skilled adaptation and innovation. Aid models do not contain any suggestion for such generation of technical progress independently of import of foreign capital or technology. Since aid models assume perfect control over expenditure patterns in the economy when in fact such control is negligible, they lead to misleading prescriptions for the real world. When imbalances between demand for and output of a wide range of goods and services are inherent in the situation, any model which ignores these imbalances can give results which are at best fairy tales and at worst pernicious make-believe. Calculations of massive injections of foreign aid 'desired' by builders of aid models and actual inflows of aid into India (and other underdeveloped countries) are in any case only tenuously related. Recognition of this fact and designing of our economic programmes on that basis is likely to give better results than the alternative of hoping that the supply of aid will be determined by our demand. A properly conceived second-best is usually better than the accidentally deformed optimum.||Amiya Bagchi

The most pronounced increase in this respect has taken place in Punjab, and to a lesser extent in Haryana and Western Uttar Pradesh. On the whole, the increase has been greater in the wheat belt than in the rice belt. The evidence however suggested that farmers in Punjab had begun to invest in these capital assets tion to the stock of fixed capital during the period, the composition of the stock of fixed capital shows remarkable change with the newer types of capital assets increasing considerably and the flow of services from fixed capital increasing in the same manner as the stock of fixed capital. Similarly, while the increase in working capital parallelled the increase in fixed capital, the share in it of newer inputs such as fertiliser, water, electricity, fuel oil also increased significantly. The evidence however suggested that farmers in Punjab had begun to invest in these capital assets long before the new agricultural technology made its appearance, though now, with the scale of growth in output in Punjab, some restructuring of the capital assets may be called for.

If government is to function as a service for the benefit of the people, State and local administrations must work as two active and co-operative members of a partnership. For this purpose, State controls over local government bodies should be subtle and carefully balanced to forestall malpractices while avoiding any tendencies which stifle local initiative. These controls should be reduced in number and rationalised by working out model bye-laws, regulations and budgetary patterns. State governments ought to intervene only when prescribed standards are not adhered to, allowing local bodies to frame their own particular procedures and regulations. Inspectorates of local bodies should be established by ministries of local government to maintain specialised and sympathetic liaison between the two partners. These are among the suggestions spelt out in detail in the article below.||Mohan Singhal

Five industries have been selected for study - cotton textiles, sugar, engineering goods, cement and tea plantations - and the period covered is 1950-65. The results yielded by the statistical analysis need to be treated with caution because of the non-quantifiability of exogenous factors affecting business investment. Nonetheless, they provide some useful empirical information on the effect of three important economic variables on the pattern of investment in some major industries.||Debjani Sarkar

The difference today is that software or knowhow is becoming more a commodity and hence a subject for political economy. Transfer of technology can occur in different combinations of imported or indigenous manpower skills, hardware and software, ranging from total import of all three to use of only indigenous elements of technology. While it is possible to construct a scale of preference, and of priority in time, for these different combinations for the different industries, the choice has to be made with full knowledge of the differences between the alternative solutions, their advantages and likely weaknesses. In all this, however, the implantation of a technological-scientific infrastructure (TSI) is of crucial importance for an adequate transfer mechanism. Instead of consolidating a situation of dependence on transfer of ready-made products of science and technology with all the ensuing negative aspects - including the high cost of transfer - of proprietary knowledge, a much bolder effort should be made to create the TSI in the developing countries. This article outlines the essential elements of such an infrastructure and the kinds of protection to indigenous science and technology that such building up would require.||Ignacy Sachs

1/7/1970- ||contexts and catalysts of change||4360262||Is the Modernity-Tradition Model All Bad?||There is a tendency today to denigrate the old dichotomy between tradition and modernity. It is necessary to tread cautiously here because there may be a danger of the baby being thrown away with the bath-water. While 'traditional' and 'modern' do in some sense refer to social structures that are radically different enough from each other to be mutually exclusive, an analytical distinction needs to be made between the ways in which traditional societies-and the institutions and values of which they are constituted-are genuinely different from modern societies, and the ways in which modern societies can accommodate social structures and cultural values which bear more than a chance or casual relationship to the traditional societies that preceded them or out of which they historically grew. The problem can be best dealt with by turning to some of its concrete manifestations, say in Japan and India. We see then that many of the social forms that seem to be a carryover from the traditional system are not in fact old forms that persisted. Rather, they are new forms with old names and have recruited their members from the old by using sufficient quanta of cognitive and conceptual material to sustain within them a sense of cultural continuity. To let what makes for such continuity constitute grounds for sounding the death-knell of the tradition-modernity model is assuredly to throw away the baby with the bath-water.||Harold A. Gould
