There is no analytic assessment of the objective situation which has lead to these phenomena nor is there any objective interpretation of their role in such industrial development as has occurred so far. It is argued in section I of this paper that pure monopoly as defined in the text-books is a rare phenomenon and that in a large number of cases short-run monopolistic practices and gains reflect the operation of the competitive principle and represent, in fact, the most powerful engine of growth. To found a family industrial empire is a powerful motivating factor for economic development and, given the distribution of entrepreneurial talent at a given place and time and the objective economic environment and policies, it is natural to expect a few family empires at the top of the economic structure; but it is not often realised that the composition of these families change over a period of time (section II). It is true, however, that the planning process and related policies restrict the operation of the competitive principle and result in strengthening the pure monopoly elements in the market structure of a commodity; if policy goals and policies are not rationally formulated, the planning process itself may strengthen the monopoly elements in the economic structure. Appropriate policies to eliminate the effects of such monopoly elements in the Indian context are discussed in section III of the article.||V. V. Bhatt
28/2/1970- ||review of management, february 1970||4359675||Data Gaps Facing Business Economists||If practising economists in India were asked to rank the major hazards of their profession, "data gaps" would perhaps receive the highest score. The ease with which business economists in the more developed countries can lay their hands on useful environmental data certainly has enabled them to play an influential role in their organisations. A strategy for improving the data system should undoubtedly receive the higher priority in India. The purpose of this paper is not to make a comprehensive analysis of all the data difficulties facing the Indian business economist. Such an attempt is no doubt important and must be made by the practising economists at an appropriate time. In the present paper, my objective will be to outline a framework for analysing data gaps and to raise some questions about the lines along which efforts should be made to improve the data system.

Quite apart from the slow torture inflicted by napalm, gases which are called "irritants" by the US Army often have fatal consequences for their victims, many of whom are innocent civilians. Defoliant spraying kills vegetation as well as animals and its side-effects include deformed babies. Long-term changes in soil and weather conditions are not yet known.||Navroz Mody

The author suggests that in the favourable circumstances then prevailing, a modern ship-building industry should have been the natural outcome of Parsi enterprise but for the hostility of the then ruling power which by discouraging the incipient ship-building and navigation industry halted and distorted a potential industrialisation process. The growth of the Parsi ship-building industry during this period did not take place in a vacuum. It had the congenial environment of overall, multi-dimensional progress of the Parsi community. Even finance, without which no potential industry could have made any advance, was becoming highly organised and was abundant. At the same time, the Parsis were prudent enough to avoid competition with the British. They collaborated with British agency houses as brokers or junior partners or as both. They entered into a symbiotic patron-client relationships with the British. Every Parsi millionaire had one or two British patrons. The former lent their money, the latter their imposing names and this worked remarkably well in the colonial business world. The Parsis also found it convenient to put Europeans in charge of their ships. Further, the practice, which was almost customary with the Parsis, of apprenticing their wards with European firms further strengthened their ties with the British business community. The Parsi business community thus emerged as a comprador capitalist class right from its origin. In fields ranging from supply of cotton to the British textile industry to distributing British manufactures all over northern, central and southern India and the marketing of contraband opium from China, their role was crucially useful to British interests. Shipping was, however, the one exception; here the initial success of the Parsis in developing an indigenous shipping industry was definitely frowned upon by the British. [H Rairkar prepared a card index of names and other antecedents of all Indian ships mentioned in the relevant documents for the period for my use. This was helpful for cross-checking information obtained from diverse sources.]||Amalendu Guha
