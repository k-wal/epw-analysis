This is exemplified by assessing the production and livelihood systems adopted by inhabitants of a settlement located in the northern mountainous tribal belt of Himachal Pradesh. The main finding is that traditional practices regarding livelihood systems (mainly agriculture and livestock-raising) were entirely subservient to ecological conditions. Historically speaking, the 'Rajah's' equitable land distribution policy and the resultant phenomenon of universal land ownership may have fostered these sustainable practices. A legacy of the past, these practices are noticeable even today. Under these circumstances the question of sustainability assumes new significance.||Rinki Sarkar

Integrated Watershed Development Programme is the major policy instrument for achieving this goal. The approach, though quite comprehensive, however, has come at a time when the global environmental concerns have become quite strong. In turn, this has exerted significant influence in changing the central thrust as well as the composition of watershed development programmes in India. It is the contention of this paper that the global environmental concerns have diverted attention for productivity concerns and therby resorting to some of the softer options emphasising indigenous technology, low cost measures and participatory institutional development. It is argued that external forces have deviated the policies from making substantial investments in land which farmers otherwise cannot afford to make on their own. Also, a participatory approach for project implementation, per se, may not bring desired results in terms of enhancement of productivity and livelihood security. Finally, given the options, farmers prefer yield augmenting technologies and are willing to pay for the cost: This in turn also helps bringing more effective (interactive) participation in the SWC-programme.||Amita Shah

However, the various judicial bodies which have been called upon to address the issue have not ventured to look at the issue objectively and examine the moral, ethical and environmental dimensions. As a result, judicial process has often recognised undesirable standards incompatible with the larger social needs.||V. Manoj

Little information on the processes has been made available to the public nor has there been a proper scientific assessment of the potential environmental consequences of the plant.||K. Ramachandran

The further categorisation of this as a question of 'regional security' is fraught with the danger of bringing such conflicts within the ambit of post-cold war American concepts of 'regional trouble spots' and their possible bearing on the perceived American interests in the regions concerned. The academic community should be wary of being co-opted into providing a theoretical underpinning for this.||Ramaswamy R. Iyer

In spite of promulgating various acts and instituting ministry for environment and forestry, the record of their implementation has been dismal. There has been a recent spurt in NGO activities in generating environmental awareness. Yet, systematic introduction of environment issues into educational curricula is awaited.||V. S. Vyas,V.

Crop residues are important components of soil fertility management, but are burnt in some areas such as Punjab state. Not only does this mean a loss of nutrients but also causes environmental pollution (and the associated health effects); the production of substantial quantities of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas can adversely affect the environment. Limited published data suggest that rice-straw can be converted to high value manure of a quality better than that of farmyard manure (FYM). Its use along with chemical fertilisers should not only sustain present level of crop yields but also increase it. It would, however, require policy interventions perhaps both at the levels of the state and central governments.||B. S. Sidhu,O. P. Rupela,V. Beri,P. K. Joshi

Long-term effects like ecological disequilibriums remain unaccounted for due to an absence of comprehensive pre-project environmental impact assessment. This article, studying three projects, namely, Hirakud, Ukai and Indira Gandhi Nahar Project (IGNP), clearly demonstrates the glaring and complete dichotomy between pre-construction projections and post-construction realities. Water-logging, salinity, sedimentation and health hazards have a high possibility of occurrence. Even flood control, irrigation and power generation are not effective as envisaged. These experiences, the article argues, need to be studied in-depth and made to constitute an important part of future planning for MRVPs.||Rohan D'Souza,Pranab Mukhopadhyay,Ashish Kothari

Farmers, acting collectively, rather than governments, have determined both procedures for distributing water and resolution of conflicts with other groups over the development of additional supplies. The 'ahar-pyne' system in south Bihar is one such indigenous irrigation system in India, which has successfully galvanised the local farming community in large numbers against caste divisions and ecological obstacles for over 100 years and ensured equitable distribution of water among individual cultivators.||Niranjan Pant

Such policies favoured large landowners, foreign corporations and banks over the majority of the people of Central America. The Central American development experience could provide a useful lesson for other third world countries.||Kalim Siddiqui

Naturally, the shrimp industry lobby, with the backing of politicians, international institutions like the FAO, and multinational investors, has stepped up its campaign to re-legitimise shrimp farming.||Jasper Goss

This imposes a cost on other members of society. The critical state of atmospheric pollution in Delhi is a clear indication that policies currently in use have failed to make the desired impact and it is important to implement economic instruments and improve enforcement.||Rita Pandey
