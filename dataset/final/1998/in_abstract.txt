As a theory it includes the possibility of a metamorphosis opposite to Kafka's, in which insects can become not only human beings but heroes. As political science, it includes the problem of minimal well-being of which usual political science takes no account. Rather than contrasting the cosmic visions of the Mayas with those of the west, it combines and dominates the vision of the Mayas and of the west and makes seminal contributions to both.||Pablo Gonzalez Casanova

This is exemplified by assessing the production and livelihood systems adopted by inhabitants of a settlement located in the northern mountainous tribal belt of Himachal Pradesh. The main finding is that traditional practices regarding livelihood systems (mainly agriculture and livestock-raising) were entirely subservient to ecological conditions. Historically speaking, the 'Rajah's' equitable land distribution policy and the resultant phenomenon of universal land ownership may have fostered these sustainable practices. A legacy of the past, these practices are noticeable even today. Under these circumstances the question of sustainability assumes new significance.||Rinki Sarkar

Integrated Watershed Development Programme is the major policy instrument for achieving this goal. The approach, though quite comprehensive, however, has come at a time when the global environmental concerns have become quite strong. In turn, this has exerted significant influence in changing the central thrust as well as the composition of watershed development programmes in India. It is the contention of this paper that the global environmental concerns have diverted attention for productivity concerns and therby resorting to some of the softer options emphasising indigenous technology, low cost measures and participatory institutional development. It is argued that external forces have deviated the policies from making substantial investments in land which farmers otherwise cannot afford to make on their own. Also, a participatory approach for project implementation, per se, may not bring desired results in terms of enhancement of productivity and livelihood security. Finally, given the options, farmers prefer yield augmenting technologies and are willing to pay for the cost: This in turn also helps bringing more effective (interactive) participation in the SWC-programme.||Amita Shah

12/12/1998-18/12/1998||special articles||4407472||Water Resource Planning: Changing Perspectives||Water resources planning in India has largely meant irrigation development through big-dam projects. Over the years a powerful movement has emerged against such projects. The paper spells out the issues involved and the opposing views. There is a sharp polarisation of attitudes on this matter. The World Commission on Dams established by the World Bank and the World Conservation Union (IUCN) in order to resolve this impasse is expected to submit its report in the year 2000. A crucial question in this context would be whether there are effective alternatives to large dams for meeting the future needs of water and energy. There have been some very successful local initiatives in watershed development and social transformation, which seem to indicate that significant results can be achieved through these means. What is needed is a major reorientation in the approach to water resource policy. The paper sets forth some recommendations in this regard.||Ramaswamy R. Iyer

Unfortunately, the performance of this sector has been far from satisfactory. Poor state of maintenance, largely due to paucity of funds available with the state government and low water rates and their poor recovery, is responsible for the system's inefficiency. This paper contends that there is need not only for allocating more funds for operation and maintenance of existing systems and enhancing water rates to restore the financial health of the public irrigation works, but also for financial and functional autonomy through suitable institutional and organisational changes. This will not only provide the irrigation agencies much needed flexibility and ensure accountability, but will also provide opportunity to the users to bring about suitable changes in crop-mix dictated by the market conditions.||Ashok K.

The further categorisation of this as a question of 'regional security' is fraught with the danger of bringing such conflicts within the ambit of post-cold war American concepts of 'regional trouble spots' and their possible bearing on the perceived American interests in the regions concerned.

The estimates show that user financing becomes essential for sustainability of the system. Since user financing affects weaker sections adversely, a subsidy from consumers above poverty line to those below is incorporated in the tariff design along the Faulhaberian principles. The rate so arrived at, indicates that public subsidy is still needed for some states with high cost of provision due to their hydro-geological and topographical conditions and/or cost inefficiency. Analysis of institutions based on co-operative action among users suggests that they have several advantages over the other polar alternatives, state ownership and privatisation, in providing potable water. Participatory management inherent in such institutions also enables the government to change its role from provider to facilitator.||K. Pushpangadan,G. Murugan

They are not only more efficient in terms of providing 'human capital' but they are also more equitable. Nevertheless, there is little information about what developing country governments spend on these basic services. This paper presents data from six case studies - El Salvador, Guinea, Nepal, Niger, Philippines and Tanzania - estimating the level of public spending on basic social services with special emphasis on the need for future work on assessing the possibilities for increasing these expenditures. The relevance to issues in the health and education sector in India is notable.||Santosh Mehrotra,Jan Vandemoortele,Enrique Delamonica

Crop residues are important components of soil fertility management, but are burnt in some areas such as Punjab state. Not only does this mean a loss of nutrients but also causes environmental pollution (and the associated health effects); the production of substantial quantities of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas can adversely affect the environment. Limited published data suggest that rice-straw can be converted to high value manure of a quality better than that of farmyard manure (FYM). Its use along with chemical fertilisers should not only sustain present level of crop yields but also increase it. It would, however, require policy interventions perhaps both at the levels of the state and central governments.||B. S. Sidhu,O. P. Rupela,V. Beri,P. K. Joshi

Long-term effects like ecological disequilibriums remain unaccounted for due to an absence of comprehensive pre-project environmental impact assessment. This article, studying three projects, namely, Hirakud, Ukai and Indira Gandhi Nahar Project (IGNP), clearly demonstrates the glaring and complete dichotomy between pre-construction projections and post-construction realities. Water-logging, salinity, sedimentation and health hazards have a high possibility of occurrence. Even flood control, irrigation and power generation are not effective as envisaged. These experiences, the article argues, need to be studied in-depth and made to constitute an important part of future planning for MRVPs.||Rohan D'Souza,Pranab Mukhopadhyay,Ashish Kothari

The authors' preference is for the financial explanation, though this does not amount to complete disavowal of the responsibility of structural factors in precipitating the crisis. The financial collapse was the logical culmination of an inappropriate financial liberalisation strategy with volatile capital flows acting as a triggering factor. The IMF's misdiagnosis played a part in aggravating the crisis and in prolonging its duration. Ever since the outbreak of the crisis, speculation has been rife about the likelihood of the contagion spreading and the extent of its possible spread. Policy-makers in different countries have been exercised about measures to forestall the spread to their respective economies. The authors address these and related issues with respect to the two Asian giants, India and China.||Ajit S. Bhalla,Dilip M. Nachane

This is done by first examining basic philosophical divides between the treatment of water as a commodity versus a common heritage. Customary and statutory rights structures governing groundwater and surface water in India are discussed next followed by current debates over reform. Thoughts toward a new rights and governance structure drawing on key features in existing practice are then outlined. In conclusion, the author argues that governance structures must be designed to create a balance of power in water use decisions between private (either individual or group) right holders and common rights that reflect the common heritage nature of water resources.||Marcus Moench

Farmers, acting collectively, rather than governments, have determined both procedures for distributing water and resolution of conflicts with other groups over the development of additional supplies. The 'ahar-pyne' system in south Bihar is one such indigenous irrigation system in India, which has successfully galvanised the local farming community in large numbers against caste divisions and ecological obstacles for over 100 years and ensured equitable distribution of water among individual cultivators.||Niranjan Pant

Whereas in the past there were multiple forms of water conservation, the colonial period put major emphasis on wells, and its active encouragement to the use of mechanised pumps led to unsustainable extraction of groundwater since early 20th century. Neverthelss, it would be untrue as has been argued, to attribute the current water crisis to commercialisation of agriculture accompanied by rise of so-called economic individualism during the colonial period. As this paper argues, the colonial rule did not destroy the traditional hierarchical 'village communities', but rather by granting property in land and rights to water, it modified as well as strengthened their basis of power. It is this system which continues to deprive the rural poor from access to resources, and only recourse to a variety of local systems of water harvesting suited to the topography of particular area and controlled by those who need it, can do away with the inequitous system of water harvesting and distribution.||David Hardiman

On finding through a statistical test that primary and intermediate inputs are not separable in the production function, the present analysis proceeds with an estimation of TFP on the basis of output in place of the usually preferred variable 'value added' in the Indian studies. As a fall-out of such a step, the growth recorded by TFP is found to have a positive trend with a marked deceleration during the 1980s. Such a result, therefore, enabled the study to come up with a conclusion that there was no 'turn around' in TFP growth during the 1980s as has been pointed out recently. Extending the TFP estimation to a selected set of industries, identified by the Central Pollution Control Board, New Delhi, to be amongst the most polluting ones, it has been found difficult to substantiate either the claim of a turn around in the growth path of TFP during the 1980s or the option of value added as an appropriate choice for its estimation in the Indian industrial sector. An important finding of the present exercise is one of TFP in India following a fluctuating growth path.||Gopinath Pradhan,Kaustuva Barik

Moreover, it is argued that short time duration between rice-wheat crop rotation has led to sub-optimal land preparation and sub-optimal use of other inputs, causing reduction in yield of rice and wheat. While refuting any plateauing or stagnation in yield of rice and wheat, this paper nevertheless suggests that besides technological improvement, strengthening infrastructural facilities and initiating better land and water management through participatory approach can go some way in addressing the problems confronting the rice-wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic region.||Ramesh Chand,T.
