The mill-owners in order to earn bigger revenue are resorting to subterfuge in disposing of their land, workers and assets under the pretext of 'modernising' their mills. None of the agencies involved, from central government to state government institutions and the municipal authorities, appears to be unduly concerned about this major change in industrial heartland of Mumbai. In order to retain the social heritage of Girangaon, and most importantly, to retain as many jobs as possible, the state government instead of permitting piecemeal, haphazard growth through clandestine plot-by-plot sale of mill land, should actively intervene to bring together lands belonging to different mills in a particular area, so that they can be put to best possible socially relevant use.||Darryl D'Monte

It evolved from the Textile Labour Association which was itself founded by a woman. Emerging as it did at a time when unorganised sector workers, especially women, had little support in the major trade unions or from the state agencies, SEWA's struggles to survive, to provide the much needed support base for poor women, and laterally to initiate a process of change among women have today become a model for other similar efforts not only in India but elsewhere.

Discussions of the implications of all-India or inter-state poverty studies on the poverty scenario in West Bengal are followed by a critical review of some of the major studies of rural and urban poverty in the state. The aggregative state level scenario as portrayed by these studies has been contrasted with the grass roots level picture of rural poverty as it has been brought out by some of the recent case studies based on household surveys /resurveys. The implications of all these studies for formulation of effective anti-poverty policies in West Bengal are also emphasised in this paper.||Biswajit Chatterjee

This is exemplified by assessing the production and livelihood systems adopted by inhabitants of a settlement located in the northern mountainous tribal belt of Himachal Pradesh. The main finding is that traditional practices regarding livelihood systems (mainly agriculture and livestock-raising) were entirely subservient to ecological conditions.

A legacy of the past, these practices are noticeable even today. Under these circumstances the question of sustainability assumes new significance.||Rinki Sarkar

31/1/1998-06/2/1998||review of political economy, janary 1998||4406349||'Right to Work': Reading 'Rights' through Discourse on 'Work'||Recently certain post-modernist and post-modern feminist perspectives maintain that the language of rights and justice has outlived its emancipatory potential since it is always addressed to the state and law, leading to arming of the state with more powers. While approving of the need to counter this tendency of dependence on the state to initiate changes, this article argues that popular movements nevertheless cannot do away with the language of rights as it remains the sole language of proclaiming their subjectivity and agency. Moreover, the privileging of the particularistic nature of rights-claim in the post-modern discourse is itself paradoxically premised on a universal notion of equality for its justification. All people have a right to their own way of life, cultures and belief-systems only if we hold that no single culture or rationality can be privileged over the others.||Aditya Nigam

Integrated Watershed Development Programme is the major policy instrument for achieving this goal. The approach, though quite comprehensive, however, has come at a time when the global environmental concerns have become quite strong. In turn, this has exerted significant influence in changing the central thrust as well as the composition of watershed development programmes in India. It is the contention of this paper that the global environmental concerns have diverted attention for productivity concerns and therby resorting to some of the softer options emphasising indigenous technology, low cost measures and participatory institutional development. It is argued that external forces have deviated the policies from making substantial investments in land which farmers otherwise cannot afford to make on their own. Also, a participatory approach for project implementation, per se, may not bring desired results in terms of enhancement of productivity and livelihood security. Finally, given the options, farmers prefer yield augmenting technologies and are willing to pay for the cost: This in turn also helps bringing more effective (interactive) participation in the SWC-programme.||Amita Shah

Till the 1980s, it was difficult for scholars linked with foreign funding agencies to gain legitimacy and acceptance in large number of Indian universities.

On the other hand, Indian officials in the Krishi Bhavan fear that liberalisation of agricultural imports would hit Indian producers and impair the growth prospects of the farm sector. Against this background, this paper discusses: (a) the implications of removal of QRs for Indian agricultural sector, (b) circumstances that would lead to imports after removal of QRs, and (c) strategy and policy the country should follow to minimise the adverse impact of QR removal on agricultural sector.||Ramesh Chand

The attempt here is to identify the historiographic elements that constitute this genre of the history of science in India. Based on a bibliometric analysis, the priorities of historians of science in India publishing in the journal are identified. These priorities and the underlying historiography render certain kinds of problems amenable for research and investigation and foreclose the pursuit of others. In attempting a sociology of the discipline, a very preliminary one is proposed here, other themes and areas may be identified. In addition, it is suggested that the conservatism of historians of science, tied as they are to the apron-strings of the scientific establishment, has curtailed the growth of the discipline. While this review is partisan, it also seeks to gauge the growth of the discipline in terms of the precepts set down by the founders of the IJHS itself.||Dhruv Raina

Though the electoral result, wherein the Left Front's share of votes declined, suggests more of a negative vote against the state government, the Trinamul Congress-BJP combination nevertheless did provide a strong forum to those opposed to the Left Front, especially in urban areas. Besides the vilification campaign against Mamata Banerjee and the deplorable conditions of civic amenities, the declining industrial employment opportunities has rendered the CPI(M)-led government unpopular among urban masses. Though the share of urban votes is less than rural votes, the Left Front can continue to neglect the grievances of the city-dwellers only at its own peril.||Bidyut Chakrabarty

When the institutional conditions fail to hold or are incomplete it results in adverse selection and moral hazard behaviour under principal and agency relations.

The first prong is export-led growth. Here the lessons of China are particularly instructive, since China achieved in the past 15 years the kind of export-led growth that India could have achieved, but failed to achieve, because of poor public policies. The second prong is rural improvement, especially in the vast population of the Gangetic valley. India needs a specific strategy to bring modern economic growth to rural India, through a concerted campaign of infrastructure upgrading and appropriate re-design of state policy. The third prong is the maintenance of macroeconomic stability, to avoid the kind of crisis that pushed East Asia into economic collapse. The macroeconomic stakes have obviously been raised in the past year. India's macroeconomic policies will be under scrutiny as perhaps never before following the onset of the East Asian financial crisis.||Nirupam Bajpai,Jeffrey D. Sachs

The analysis explores the exporting behaviour patterns of over 1,000 firms with varying degrees of foreign ownership in India for the years 1988 to 1994, and is principally a cross-section based analysis. Since the 1950s, India followed a command-and-control based economy regime. This regime became exceedingly autarkic, particularly in the 1960s, with negative consequences on her ability to make headway in export markets or to attract foreign investment. Since 1991, an economic policy switch is in progress and there have been moves towards a market-based regime in which foreign capital, both on the current account via the generation of export sales as well as on the capital account via foreign investments, is expected to play a big part. An empirical examination of the consequences of following, or not really following as happened in the Indian case, liberal trade policies is absolutely necessary since economic policy-making in India seems to be entirely based on ad hocism and intuition and not on the necessary and vital hard facts.||Sumit K.

The process of economic development is situated in the wider context of political democracy to explore the interaction between economics and politics in independent India. An analytical framework is set out and the past five decades are divided into three phases. The current phase, it is concluded, is characterised by an absence of consensus and a presence of short-termism, in which the economics of liberalisation and the politics of empowerment are moving the economy and the polity in opposite directions. The need for conflict resolution is greater than ever before. But the task has become more difficult. And, strangely enough, the effort is much less.||Deepak Nayyar

Resilient socio-cultural norms and stereotypes, organisational inefficiencies and weaknesses, and lack of political will to undertake major public health and educational reforms and tackle poverty, are the main inhibiting factors. Moreover, constraints upon open discussion of sex and sexuality inhibit the emergence of safe spaces wherein enough information may be obtained. Underlying these are the patriarchal structures and gender relations that constitute the most enduring obstacles. Bridging the gap between women's powerlessness and the uncharted terrain of men's private behaviour is one of the major cultural and political challenges posed by the Aids epidemic.||Radhika Ramasubban

The production system now is under threat due to stagnating or declining crop productivity, and threatening the issues related to sustainability. This paper attempted to measure sustainability of the RWCS using the total factor productivity (TFP) approach. The paper also examines the role of legumes, if any, in improving the sustainability of this most important and productive production system in the country. The results suggest that the growth in TFP of dominant RWCS has either declined or stagnated. Legumes play important role in improving the sustainability of the system. Ironically, rice and wheat have replaced the principal legumes over a period of time. With the availability of high-yielding and short duration varieties of important legumes, there is a need to incorporate them in the RWCS to improve the sustainability of the system so as to meet the future foodgrain demands without degradation of the natural resource base.||Praduman Kumar,P.

The World Commission on Dams established by the World Bank and the World Conservation Union (IUCN) in order to resolve this impasse is expected to submit its report in the year 2000. A crucial question in this context would be whether there are effective alternatives to large dams for meeting the future needs of water and energy. There have been some very successful local initiatives in watershed development and social transformation, which seem to indicate that significant results can be achieved through these means. What is needed is a major reorientation in the approach to water resource policy. The paper sets forth some recommendations in this regard.||Ramaswamy R. Iyer

The trends which were visible in the pre-independence days were reinforced in the last 50 post-independence years. A heterogeneous labour force are employed without the sanction of labour legislation and they are rising continually in third world urban sites or agglomerates. Both domestic and foreign firms have thrived in the city area on the basis of ancillarisation. The paper attempts to trace the changing pattern of labour use in this amorphous segment in Calcutta urban agglomerate during the last few decades. The all-India industrial scene also revealed an increasing trend of marginalisation and casualisation of the labour force. Calcutta has witnessed a spurt in informal activities during the last few decades. The city also experienced a difference in policy prescriptions as the state of West Bengal has been under Left Front regime during the last two decades. Labour organisations are much stronger in this state and labour movements have included the workers in this segment. The paper investigates whether this has affected the pattern of labour use in this sector vis-a-vis the rest of the country.||Ishita Mukhopadhyay

Unfortunately, the performance of this sector has been far from satisfactory. Poor state of maintenance, largely due to paucity of funds available with the state government and low water rates and their poor recovery, is responsible for the system's inefficiency. This paper contends that there is need not only for allocating more funds for operation and maintenance of existing systems and enhancing water rates to restore the financial health of the public irrigation works, but also for financial and functional autonomy through suitable institutional and organisational changes. This will not only provide the irrigation agencies much needed flexibility and ensure accountability, but will also provide opportunity to the users to bring about suitable changes in crop-mix dictated by the market conditions.||Ashok K.

The transition has slowed down during the export and industrial recession of 1996-97 and 1997-98, but should resume if conditions improve in 1998-99. Given its scale and the nature of the change, the industry represents the most important example of structural transformation in industry induced by the reforms. This article describes the process with reference to the weaving and the textile machinery segments of the industry. The broad conclusions of the paper are the following. The change in the textile industry can be interpreted as an instance of a delayed integration with the world market. On the one hand, textiles have regained a 'leading sector' role that it had nearly forgone in the pre-reform regime. But, on the other hand, having to compete in a world market has exposed many areas of technological and organisational weaknesses, especially in the capital goods sector.||Tirthankar Roy

On the basis of case studies of four weavers' co-operative societies and other data the article finds that competition from powerlooms can only partly explain the decline of handlooms, as there is a new and growing market for handloom. By far the more serious reason is politicisation of co-operative societies and government and bureaucratic control.||Kanakalatha Mukund,B. Syamasundari

Even as it is generally argued that inflation is not good for growth, some investigators have pointed out that the negative effect is pronounced and serious only if inflation breaches its specific threshold rate for a country in question. This paper makes an exploratory attempt at empirically estimating such a specific threshold inflation rate for India by following the methodology due to Sarel (1997). With a sample covering a period from 1981-82 to 1995-96, it is estimated that an inflation rate of more than a threshold rate of 6 per cent per annum would have a significant downward impact on growth in India as against Sarel's common estimate of a higher threshold of 8 per cent for a large pooled sample of 87 countries including India and covering a period from 1970 to 1990. In particular, our empirical results indicate that, on an average, a single percentage point increase in the inflation rate above the threshold rate of 6 per cent per annum harms economic growth in India by about half a percentage point per annum. It is also demonstrated that the estimated threshold inflation rate is robust and invariant to changing sample periods including the pre- and post-liberalisation phases.||R. Kannan,Himanshu Joshi

An examination of the Chakravarty Committee paradigm in this changed milieu motivated us to see the role of two key variables in the conduct of monetary policy, viz, interest rates and exchange rates. The long-run relationship between money, prices, output, and exchange rate is examined and the impact of money market disequilibrium on interest rate is traced by testing the joint significance of the lags of disequilibrium errors. We also conduct weak and block exogenity tests for exchange rates. Interest rates and exchange rates are seen to be endogenously determined in the liberalised regime beginning 1992-93, raising the possibility of the change in transmission mechanism following the advent of financial reforms. The recent shifts in the operating procedure of monetary policy are in consonance with our findings.||Partha Ray,Himanshu Joshi,Mridul Saggar

09/5/1998-15/5/1998||special articles||4406752||Narrow Banking: Theory, Evidence and Prospects in India||The narrow banking proposal defining a class of safe and liquid assets (generally sovereign government securities) for investments by weak banks, backed fully by demand liabilities (generally non-interest bearing deposits) has been considered as a means of deposit protection and a possible solution to the banking problems. We seek to explain the theoretical implications of the proposal and examine its implications for the Indian public sector banks facing large non-performing loans. The evidence presented in this paper, based on published and audited annual accounts, shows that even without a directive, narrow banking on the asset side is already being practised as part of the asset-liability management by these banks. However, given the structure of deposit ownership, narrow banking in its strict sense does not afford a solution to reforming weak banks. Strictly practised narrow banking can neither guarantee deposit protection nor turn around the weak banks. On the contrary, it can expose weak banks to immense market and interest rate risks which can make the banking system vulnerable to idiosyncratic and systemic risks arising from macro-economic shocks. Considering the fact that the problem of non-performing loans is not as alarming in India as in some other emerging markets, this paper suggests a cautious approach to strengthening the banking structure. Pitching excessively restrictive speed limits in this scenario might turn out to be counter-productive. The paper, however, recognises that some contraction in the scale of operations of the weak banks seems to be an unavoidable by-product of measures which may be necessary to strengthen weak banks.||Saibal Ghosh,Mridul Saggar

The Art and Non-Art of Multi-Method Policy Research||Triangulation is a interdisciplinary social science method wherein multiple methods, databases, theories, disciplines and/or investigators are used to study the same object, event or phenomenon. This paper attempts to critically assess the method of triangulation by employing four distinct theories to decipher a complex village community event in Karnataka. What gets unravelled in the process is a central paradox at the heart of rural development practice, namely, the more particular and complex event at micro-level, the more government's respond by seeking standardised and generalised solutions. Triangulation, by meeting this imperative to recognise the general behind specific events, satisfies the requirements of policy-makers, a fulfilment which is not without its own dangers.||A.

But the types of injustices raised by new social movements are exactly the ones where this surplus transfer to capitalists is missing. This demands a rectification of the exploitation-centred critique of capitalism and an observance of a difference between exploitation and oppression. Any conception of alternative good society then requires not only elimination of exploitative conditions of wage labour but also of structures of domination beyond the sphere of production.||Vidhu Verma

The changes that have taken place in the agrarian structure seem to have reduced the incidence of rural poverty via agricultural development channel, but at the same time have generated adverse effects on it via direct distributional channel. Agricultural performance appears to have alleviated rural poverty through trickle-down effect. Labour-productivity-augmenting growth in agriculture appears to have stronger effect in reducing rural poverty than any other growth process that does not augment labour productivity significantly.||Madhusudan Ghosh

While initially they promoted serious debate among both left party-based women's groups as well as autonomous women's movement, they seem to have come to rest today. The apparent absence of a revisioning of feminist politics only suggests an ideological position of multiple/plural feminist standpoints. Within such a framework of 'difference' issues of caste become the sole responsibility of the dalit women's organisations. This absence of an exploration of different positions hinders dialectics, both of a revisioning of contemporary feminist politics and a sharpening of the positions put forth by autonomous dalit women's organisations.||Sharmila Rege

Of course, there are certain safe routes through the field that have been charted and well traversed, at least since the era of decolonisation in the middle of the 20th century. Those who wish to play it safe speak of universal humanity and brotherhood, of the falsity of the distinctions between east and west, of history as indubitable progress from backwardness to modernity, of universal access to the benefits of modern science and technology and, in more recent years, of unfettered entry into the dreamland of universal consumption in the millennium of globalisation. Not wishing to tread this safe path, the author in this paper turns to some of the political and moral issues posed by the history of relations between Europe and south Asia in the last five hundred years.||Partha Chatterjee

Nonetheless, they find causes for concern about each industry's ability to sustain growth, pointing up the need to continue to extend and deepen the reform process.||Pankaj Ghemawat,Murali Patibandla

Textile scholarship in India has seen the powerlooms' growth mainly as a distortion created by government policy. This article disputes this view, and interprets the growth as a pattern of industrialisation founded on (1) unlimited supply of low-quality labour, (2) developing systems of inter-firm co-ordination, (3) agglomeration based on such systems, and (4) continuous accumulation of capital 'from below', in artisanal activities in the past, and in modern small-scale industry and agriculture more recently.||Tirthankar Roy

During the British colonial rule, the military-feudal-imperial nexus operated through the canal colonies, enabling the Britishers to extract large profits through colonial extraction. Contradictions within this feudal agrarian system led to peasant mobilisations over tenurial rights, largely under the Kisan Sabha of the Communist Party, culminating in the Land Ceiling Act in the post-independence period. Introduction of new farm technology and the consequent monetisation of agricultural activities under the 'green revolution' signalled the second phase of agrarian transformation. Unequal terms of trade between rural and urban sectors became the major contradiction characterising this phase, and farmers' movements arose seeking redressal of this discrimination. The latest phase of agrarian transformation is signified by the shift of farmers organisations from non-electoral politics of pressure groups to active participation in electoral politics. This change reflects the growing need to address farmers' issues to wider legislative processes of decision-making and power.||Partha Nath Mukherji

Justice is seen to be ensured by the winning, granting and protection of rights which are held by the citizen. And the citizen is unmarked by any other identifying markers than that of 'citizen'. But what if we are to take 'difference' seriously in the constituting of citizenship. Then such differences should be seen as resources for democratic discussion rather than as differences to be overcome. We need to take on board the more radical and destabilising implications of commnities constituting themselves continuously around different axes, of which the cultural is only one. Using the debate around the universal civil code as a starting point, this article explores the particular way in which citizenship, in modern democratic theory, is understood to be the basis for justice.||Nivedita Menon

Over 24 rounds of the National Sample Survey, spanning 1959-94, one finds a strong positive correlation between the relative price of food and India's poverty rate. This article questions how reform critics have interpreted this correlation. It is not an income-distribution effect. Rather it appears to be due to covariate fluctuations between average consumption and food prices due to other variables, including food supply; bad agricultural years simultaneously lower rural living standards and increased food prices. The correlation is uninformative about the welfare effect of a sustained increase in the relative price of food.||Martin Ravallion

In this paper it is argued that although the initiative is in the right direction, it does not go far enough. A well thought out reform should address reforms in tax devolution along with the issue of reassignment to evolve a co-ordinated system of domestic trade taxes. In particular, to design and implement a destination based consumption type value added tax (VAT), the states should be enabled to extend their sales taxes to services in addition to goods. Further, an efficient and equitable tax system should prevent the levy of sales taxes on inter-state sale. Reforms in tax devolution should be addressed in conjunction with evolving rational, co-ordinated domestic trade taxes to bring about a structured reform of the fiscal system in Indian federalism.||M.

While discussing the various mechanisms the government could have brought into play to promote exports, the authors argue that increasing the competitiveness of domestic production is the key to improving the country's export performance. This can be brought about by a combination of two sets of initiatives: providing effective infrastructural facilities and strengthening the science and technology infrastructure to generate technologies for industry. An analysis of the budget from these standpoints shows that the budgetary proposals are not adequate to meet the requirements of the domestic productive sectors.||Biswajit Dhar,Saikat Sinha Roy

The nationalist agenda was of developing the nation through the gradual strengthening, on the cultural front, of a national middle class educated in the rational-scientific sense, affiliated with modern institutions, while retaining a consciousness of an authentic cultural identity. Cultural authenticity was sought to be protected by the ideology of the family and the feminine spirit therein, while the project of development and modernity was to be carried out in the public sphere, generally imagined to be controlled by the spirit of masculinity. Since education was the prerequisite for participation in the public sphere, the educated woman came to occupy a culturally ambiguous position of embodying both masculinity and femininity in her dual capacity as a participant in a public sphere and as a repository of cultural authenticity. The narratives of the Suchitra Sen-Uttam Kumar starrers in the Bengali popular cinema of the 1950s, of which their first hit film 'Agnipariksha' is analysed here, address this very dilemma. On the one hand, the popular image of a desirable woman in their films subverts the elite nationalist construction of a woman as the repository of cultural authenticity, but on the other, the transgressive libidinal energy of the heroine - acting-as-subject is ploughed back into the structuring order of the Bengali middle class family, thus maintaining the patriarchal boundaries.||Dulali Nag

These included deserted women, practising prostitutes and brahmin widows. But soon enough they were constrained to accept the androcentric ideal of Indianness which was coterminus with subordination. The image of the Trinidadian Hindu woman is therefore far from empowering.

As a result, although access to land remains important for the bulk of rural households, it is critically so for women. And it affects not just a few women, but a substantial majority of them. This is a feature of agrarian change which the absence of a gender perspective in most analysis and policy formulation has tended to obscure. At the same time, there is need to view the issue of women's independent access to land and livelihood as linked not just to welfare improvement and poverty alleviation, but also in important ways to productive efficiency. Prevailing male bias in access to land and in infrastructural support to farmers is undercutting the very real potential that exists for enhancing production through a more gender-egalitarian approach. To fully realise this potential, however, will need looking beyond the conventional approach of family-based farming, to experimenting with and promoting a range of alternative institutional arrangements, involving various degrees of jointness in investment and management by groups of women. To push for such alternatives, as also for the complex set of measures needed to reduce existing biases in women's access to land and livelihood, this paper emphasises the critical importance of collective action by women. In this context, although recognising that class and caste differences between women could pose difficulties, it is argued here that there are significant gender-linked commonalities of interests that would make co-operation among a broad spectrum of women possible on many counts.||Bina Agarwal

In sharp contrast to the all round failure of the centrally planned schemes for universalisation of primary education, the EGS, which guarantees primary schooling facility on a demand from a community lacking it, has proved not only cost-effective but has reached hitherto unreached sections of society in quickest possible time without compromising any of the basic requirements for quality. Moreover, by making the community and the gram panchayat the nodal points in executing the scheme, the EGS forges partnership between state governments, panchayats and communities, thus destroying the distinction between supply agency of the government and demand agency of the people, an idea that has hindered the spread and quality of primary education.||R.

There is no doubt that there have been serious lapses in the functioning of the LF state government and administration and in that way incumbency has certainly been a factor.

For the leadership of the different workers' organisations there was nothing 'historically inevitable' about combining their resources and numerical strengths in the interests of their members. This paper traces the different collective bodies thrown up by the unions, and examines their structural features and internal dynamism.||Dilip Subramanian

Was it a crisis which was deeply embedded in the structural policies and the political economy of these countries? Was the economic appraisal of these countries validated by the information which the IMF had gathered? Could it be that the IMF prescriptions exacerbated the malady, and thereby needlessly raised the costs of adjustment? Was it unambiguous that the Fund's advice was dispassionate and was not biased by the hidden agenda of the foreign economic policy of the US in particular and the OECD in general? An attempt is made in this paper to offer answers to these several riddles, some based on facts now unearthed, some on recent changes in the Fund programmes and some on inferential logic. Towards the end, certain issues having a bearing on the future of the international monetary system will be raised, particularly in the context of the new ideas currently in the air about the reform of the Fund.||Deena Khatkhate

The colonial rule provides clues to the processes of disjunctions between pure and applied science and, between research and development. The weakness of the post-colonial state to politically resolve crucial economic issues and undertake strategic development policies gave way to the 'technocratic' solutions that entrench the earlier trend.

The core of the problem as critics identify it is as follows: rights theories, they argue, subscribe to an outmoded concept of a transcendental human nature, without regard for specific cultural and historical traditions. Richard Rorty's philosophy is representative of this strain of thought. From another vantage point, that of Michel Foucault's, for example, comes the argument, that the idea that there is an essential human nature upon which we can pin rights is pure fiction. Dismissal of the concept of a transcendental human nature has had profound consequences for both the moral basis of rights, as well as the political weight ascribed to them. This dismissal, I consider, has left us without a handle to negotiate moral and political problems. This essay explores the grey areas in rights theory and charts out the consequences of abandoning the notion that there is something valuable about human nature which we must protect through rights.||Neera Chandhoke

With age, problems are compounded with increased dependency, illness and fatigue.

The Regulatory Commission (RC), which is the supreme decision-making authority, has complete autonomy and its decisions cannot be challenged in the courts or in any other appellate body. But the provisions for the RC's accountability are too weak and can be easily by-passed. Thus the structure is highly 'sabotage-prone' and can lead the power sector to a more serious and long-term crisis, making the cure worse than the disease. Yet many other states are jumping on the bandwagon of the World Bank-conceived Orissa model.||Shantanu Dixit,Girish Sant,Subodh Wagle

18/7/1998-31/7/1998||special articles||4407013||Economic Reforms and the Poor: Emerging Scenario||Since the launching of economic reforms, the question of their impact on the poor has received much attention of researchers and policy-makers. Economic reforms are part of a broader strategy assigning distinctive roles to the government, markets and people's organisations in promoting growth and in eradicating poverty. In this scheme, economic reforms are expected to play a major role in stepping up growth with the government and people's organisations looking after the poor. This paper presents a quick and impressionistic assessment of the prospects for the new strategy in the years ahead. The following propositions can be made with some confidence: (a) The poor have made some gains since independence but they still remain too weak and vulnerable to move upwards with their own initiative and efforts. The system helps them in distress but does little to nurture them as productive and creative beings; (b) There are many question marks on the capacity of economic reforms to bring about sustained growth accessible to the poor. The underlying policy-making processes focus on the short-term gains of a few groups rather than on the long-term challenges to the system posed by the future; (c) The political mobilisation of the intermediate and lower strata including the poor is gathering momentum and drawing in the lagging groups. In the medium and long run, this could be an important factor pushing the system on to a different development path. However, it is difficult to foresee clearly the course taken by this process, its impact on the system and consequences for the poor.||V. M. Rao

The issue of rights cannot be resolved as long as the predatory, rapacious, capitalist system is at the root of the system.

This paper discusses these three aspects of tax revenue sharing drawing upon the international experience in this area and proceeds to examine if certain broad principles could be established for universal application.

The Nehruvian Era and Woman's Position||The Nehruvian era, which has set the pattern of economic development for the next 40 years to follow, provides important clues for understanding the failure of modernisation project in getting rid of gender discrimination within the household and at the workplace. In spite of presiding in the 1930s over a committee on women's status, Nehru and the Planning Commission under his leadership in the post-independent India proceeded to discard the radical economic measures the committee had recommended to establish parity between men and women. Instead, the unproblematic tradition of regarding women as targets for household and motherhood-oriented welfare services was given recognition in official policy documents. Thus, challenging the patriarchal ethos of society has never been the agenda of the Indian state. But equally important, the article argues, has been the shortcomings of the women's movement in the Nehruvian period, which in its exclusive dependence on the state, neglected mass mobilisation and remained blind to subtle class and patriarchal barriers. [The Indian Association of Women's Studies recognising the need for reexamining the early decades after independence from a women's perspective organised a seminar on The Early Years of Independence: A Women's Perspective in collaboration with the Centre for Women's Development Studies, New Delhi and Women's Studies Research Centre, Baroda in August 1977. Alongwith deliberations on the complex nature of the impact of Nehruvian paradigm on women's issues and the movement, the seminar also featured the narration of the experiences of women in the numerous struggles of the time. The following set of articles is a selection from the papers presented at the seminar. Also included are three of the testimonies of women activists.]||Nirmala Banerjee

The performance indicators chosen for this study are growth of value added, capital intensity, labour productivity (partial productivity indicator) and total factor productivity (TFP). The paper also observes the performance of these industries in terms of inter-temporal changes in efficiency from 1989 to 1994. It concludes that productivity growth and efficiency level have not improved as per expectation during the post-reform period and the distribution of efficiency is skewed. However, the time period is not long enough to reach any final conclusion. But such study is needed to review the impact of liberalisation on Indian industries for better monitoring of reform policies.||Chiranjib Neogi,Buddhadeb Ghosh

In emphasising subjectivity and a moral-ethical interpretation of humanism, which was found lacking in Lenin's theory of reflection, the post-1978 thinking undermined the centrality of class and ultimately the party's claim and authority as a representative entity. yet this intellectual reassessment failed at furnishing a new persuasively and coherently articulated ideological framework since it did not address the adverse long-term political and socio-economic consequences of economic liberalisation. The post-Tienanmen period has seen a simultaneous emergence of neo-conservatism, a nostalgia for the Mao era and the receptivity to New Confucianism, as an effort to address the loss of central authority and the consequent ideological and political fragmentation by having recourse to a blend of selective western ideas and institutions with the traditional Chinese values. The post-Mao change of course illustrates the 'orientational crisis' that has enveloped Chinese socio-economic cultural order after it can no more be contained by an official orthodoxy.||Kalpana Misra

Firstly hybrid seed is produced principally by large companies and its use is set to increase following the decline of the public sector for various reasons. Secondly, smaller companies will find it increasingly difficult to compete because the market is fickle. Moreover, the plant variety protection regulations will scotch a market in second and subsequent generations.

What he has done is to scrutinise the values that sustain the quotidian arguments of mainstream (and some varieties of radical) economics and shown them to be wanting. In the process Sen has broadened the scope of enquiry of social and political philosophers and social scientists. No longer can enquiries into deprivation be regarded as an obsession of egalitarian romantics. Nor can questions of freedom and democracy be regarded as only the concern of dyed-in-the-wool liberals. In the fields of enquiry he has chosen he has been able to combine value criticism, disaggregation of apparently unitary modules of society and strong-minded empirical verification of the causes of emaciated entitlements and deprivation.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

It started as a confidence crisis translating into a currency crisis in Thailand and spread to Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. Via the exposure to these economies, Singapore too was affected somewhat while Hong Kong and Taiwan have escaped more or less unhurt. What started as a confidence-cum-currency crisis, in time became a financial crisis in most economies and a full-scale economic crisis in some. In cases like Indonesia, the next stages of the crisis series - social and political crises - were in full play. This essay is a comprehensive account of the east Asian crisis and includes discussions on the background, explanations of causes, country briefs.

This paper designs a crop-specific presumptive levy to supplement the land revenue, and presents the results of a field survey in northern Karnataka covering three crops as a prototype of the kind of exercise necessary. The survey confirms prior expectations of wide disparities in returns between crops and justifies the crop-specific approach recommended. The flat rate options to the agricultural income tax on plantations already on offer in some states suggest that a more widely-based presumptive scheme for taxation of profitable crops will prove acceptable. There cannot be any national uniformity in the crops chosen for taxation nor indeed should such uniformity be sought. There is a fortunate convergence between the requirement of stable norms for presumptive purposes, and the requirement of a taxable threshold for exemption of crop failure, whether idiosyncratic or non-idiosyncratic. For reasons having to do with information availability, and amenability to jurisdictional demarcation, it is recommended that powers of levy of both the crop-specific supplementary and the basic land revenue be decentralised to the panchayat level of government. Unless a beginning is made in a sequential crop-specific manner towards the tapping of agricultural surpluses for the local financing of agricultural infrastructure, any improvement in rural levels of living will remain dependent on uncertain transfers from higher levels of government, themselves constrained by the compliance crisis in the country.||Indira Rajaraman,M.

The estimates show that user financing becomes essential for sustainability of the system. Since user financing affects weaker sections adversely, a subsidy from consumers above poverty line to those below is incorporated in the tariff design along the Faulhaberian principles. The rate so arrived at, indicates that public subsidy is still needed for some states with high cost of provision due to their hydro-geological and topographical conditions and/or cost inefficiency. Analysis of institutions based on co-operative action among users suggests that they have several advantages over the other polar alternatives, state ownership and privatisation, in providing potable water. Participatory management inherent in such institutions also enables the government to change its role from provider to facilitator.||K. Pushpangadan,G. Murugan

There is a certain order in which the various elements of financial reforms have to be introduced. In addition, a careful assessment has to be made of the state and structure of the financial system, the financial position of the borrowers, the fiscal stance of the government, the positing of the economy in the business cycle, macro-economic stability and the nature and effectiveness of the regulatory framework. These building blocks cannot be put in place all at once but in an appropriate sequential order in a mosaic of financial reform. In other words, the sequencing and timing of financial reform are critical for its success or failure.||Deena Khatkhate

This interest differential exceeded the change in nominal exchange rates over the period. Country risk was low because growth was high. Governments committed to stimulate exports would not allow an appreciation of the exchange rate, and the large foreign inflows ruled out an immediate depreciation. Therefore private corporations and banks had a large incentive to borrow abroad in the short-term without hedging. But because medium-run expectations of depreciation had to be positive, to satisfy arbitrage, and equilibrate domestic to foreign returns, the economies were susceptible to shocks. This together with financial market weaknesses explains the rapid collapse after mild external shocks. In monetary theories of exchange rate determination, the currency depreciates under excessive money growth. We demonstrate conditions under which an expected depreciation of the exchange rate can occur under low monetary growth. Tight money policy and a high revenue deficit kept our interest rates far above foreign and triggered an industrial recession in 1996-97, and a depreciation of the exchange rate. But during the onset of the south-east Asian crisis monetary policy had been relaxed. This helped India escape the crisis. Other implications of our analysis for Indian economic trends are explored.||Ashima Goyal,Shridhar Dash

The model is then applied in the current Indian context to determine the optimal pace of capital account convertibility (CAC). The results, obtained using control theory, indicate the urgent need for phasing in CAC gradually because any attempt at 'shock therapy' by exceeding this pace could, under the present circumstances, result in an economic stagnation characterised by low growth, high real rates of interest and overshooting exchange rates.||M.

The fundamental basis of the 'converging' outcome is the neo-classical assumption of the law of diminishing returns to capital. In contrast to the conventional results of the developed countries, the present paper has found that Indian states have been diverging over the period of last 35 years. Moreover, this result does not nullify the role of planning through disbursement of development funds across the states. The Indian scenario exhibits interesting relationship between private and public capital in the regional context. Later a simple model is developed to highlight the relationship between growth and public investment.||Buddhadeb Ghosh,Sugata Marjit,Chiranjib Neogi

This growth of small industries began largely as an ancillarisation operation of large and medium industries. However, the ancillarisation and the small and informal based industrialisation proved productive for industries which grew depending on government orders, but was counterproductive for expansion of consumer goods industries facing market competition and risk. This feature can be explained in terms of risk perception of producers which is conditional upon uncertainties attached to future net returns of investment. The responsibility for reversing this situation lies with the government - its commitments as well as on the innovative management practices of entrepreneurs.||Ajitava Raychaudhuri,Biswajit Chatterjee

One of the first results was the dissolution of the USSR into 15 independent states, which have pursued a variety of policies. In Russia, during 1991-98 policy initiatives by nominally liberal politicians and their international backers had considerable influence, despite their limited elite and popular support. In the short run the liberal revolution in Russia failed in its economic goal of establishing a civilised market economy. Instead it created a mutant economic system, which was severely shaken by the crisis of May-August 1998 and remains in deep decline. What caused this situation? What are the possible consequences of these events? What are the prospects for the Russian economy?||Michael Ellman,Robert Scharrenborg

The contemporary Afro-American middle class, in contrast, derives its position from greater income levels which have created a social distance between it and its urban poor brethrens. Nevertheless, despite its economic improvement, the new Afro-American middle class faces racial discrimination and bigotry which is forcing it towards separatist nationalism. Thus, despite their desperate desire to escape the ghetto, racial discrimination and changes within the American economy threaten the new African American middle class in ways that force its members to consider the plight of those who remain in the ghetto.||Robert Gregg

07/3/1998-13/3/1998||perspectives||4406493||Ambedkar and Indian Nationalism||The Indian national struggle of the first half of this century was not merely a struggle to wrest political power from foreign rule but also a struggle to lay the foundation of modern India by purging society of outmoded social institutions, practices, beliefs and attitudes. Ambedkar's struggle constituted a part of the internal struggle of a nation-in-the-making, one of the divergent and sometimes conflicting currents all of which helped to secure 'freedom' - from external and internal oppression and enslavement. Without Ambedkar's opposition to mainstream nationalism, the process of internal consolidation of the nation would not have been carried out sufficiently enough to strengthen and broaden the social base of Indian nationalism.||S.

07/3/1998-13/3/1998||special articles||4406495||Capital Cannibalism, Currency Chaos and the IMF||Two parts of financial markets can and do work at cross purposes. An inflow of foreign investment can be effectively reversed by taking positions in currency markets, spot and forward. The net outcome of such journeys with the time machine of financial instruments is called here 'capital cannibalism'. It is suspected that a sizeable amount of currency trade is engaged in such round-trips for private profit, but national waste. This paper also proves that free mobility of international capital necessarily leads to chaos in exchange rates. Volatility of exchange rates, in turn, prompts capital cannibalism. It is claimed here that this two-fold phenomenon can be moderated by a small levy on currency transactions, better known as the Tobin tax. Evidently, the IMF, in Asia and Latin America, often compels the governments to assume the responsibility for servicing private foreign debts. Such nationalisation of private external liabilities brings great relief to a handful of reckless business corporations and banks, but inflicts serious pains on the people all around. This practice is neither fair nor prudent. It might be better to let the defaulting companies pay the price for their follies, and go down in bankruptcy. The damage can thus be contained and localised, rather than spreading it throughout the economy, over millions of innocent people. The IMF ought to wake up to the reality of capital cannibalism and currency chaos; or it will soon find itself buried while in slumber.||Ranjit Sau

26/9/1998-02/10/1998||review of agriculture, september 1998||4407209||India's Agricultural Dynamics: Weak Link in Development||There has been a growing concern on the performance of agricultural sector in recent years. The regional balance in growth has also been a matter of interest both in policies and academic discussions. The central budget speeches in recent years have noted the need to accelerate agricultural growth as it has been slower growth than the growth of the other sectors. The declining real public investment in agriculture has also been cited with concern given the implication of such trends to agricultural growth. It is useful to examine the longer-term trends in agricultural growth to place in perspective the more recent trends. This paper is an attempt to assess the trends in agricultural output both at the national level and the state level. The study shows that there are strong cyclical patterns in the growth trends and there is evidence of convergence of the growth rates at the state level in the shorter intervals of time. But in the longer term, the state level growth rates converge to different levels. Thus, the concerns regarding slower rate of growth at the overall level and the divergent growth pattern of the states are well founded. Unless there are policies which strengthen the investment climate in agriculture, by operating on both the supply and demand factors, the slower growth at the national level and the consequent state level imbalances would continue.||Shashanka Bhide,K.

In particular implementation of radical land reforms at the very start would have resulted in speedy demographic transition and effective trickle down mechanisms, as was the case in some of the east Asian countries. In India since redistribution of land by further lowering the legal ceiling on landholdings is not politically feasible and implementation of top-down subsidy-oriented poverty alleviation programmes is not likely to be effective, economic and social empowerment of the poor has to be achieved basically through productive employment and human development. This requires rapid broad-based labour-intensive growth.||C. H. Hanumantha Rao

The author argues that criticisms of teleological, unitary conceptions of the working class do not necessitate a shift from but rather a revision of the ways in which we think of structural analysis. By examining the linkages between class, gender and community in the jute mills it is possible to move away from a focus on the ways in which cultural difference forecloses class politics to an understanding of the ways in which different forms of class-based political practices may contest and reproduce the intersecting structural hierarchies which constitute the working class.||Leela Fernandes

Crop residues are important components of soil fertility management, but are burnt in some areas such as Punjab state. Not only does this mean a loss of nutrients but also causes environmental pollution (and the associated health effects); the production of substantial quantities of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas can adversely affect the environment. Limited published data suggest that rice-straw can be converted to high value manure of a quality better than that of farmyard manure (FYM). Its use along with chemical fertilisers should not only sustain present level of crop yields but also increase it. It would, however, require policy interventions perhaps both at the levels of the state and central governments.||B. S. Sidhu,O. P. Rupela,V. Beri,P. K. Joshi

The paper argues that despite the BJP's attempts to moderate its hindutva ideology and style of campaigning, leading to some broadening of its social base, it has not emerged as a broad-based aggregative and dominant party in UP on the lines of the Congress. With the SP and the BSP remaining strong regional parties with distinct bases capable of challenging the BJP, there are structural limitations to the BJP's expansion. As a result, the party system in UP is still in a state of flux.||Sudha Pai
31/1/1998-06/2/1998||special articles||4406354||Saffroning the Past: Of Myths, Histories and Right-Wing Agendas||Towards the late 1980s the stage was set for a conflation of an ongoing social and political crisis of a high order with the surfacing of middle class insecurities about the state of 'their' nation and of 'their' hegemonic position within it. This was the background to a rightward shift of politics, the rise of a fascist hindutva brigade and a shift of upper caste, middle class allegiance to Hindu majoritarian ideological and political formations. The ideological context for this shift was a crisis of the legitimacy of the state. One way of dealing with the crisis is to 're'construct the nation's 'glorious' past. And this is being done today not through powerful writing but through the power of the visual medium, the cinema and the television. It was a fairly conscious move by the state to telecast religious mega serials, 'Ramayana' and 'Mahabharata'. 'Chanakya' took off on the theme of a fragmented nation, carrying the mythological tradition forward in a more coherent way emphasising a joint 'xenophobia' against the enemy within. Although 'Chanakya"s appeal was limited to an upper caste elite, it was part of a larger process in which a brahmanic Hindu view of history and culture was consolidated along with a rightward shift in politics.||Uma Chakravarti

Long-term effects like ecological disequilibriums remain unaccounted for due to an absence of comprehensive pre-project environmental impact assessment. This article, studying three projects, namely, Hirakud, Ukai and Indira Gandhi Nahar Project (IGNP), clearly demonstrates the glaring and complete dichotomy between pre-construction projections and post-construction realities. Water-logging, salinity, sedimentation and health hazards have a high possibility of occurrence. Even flood control, irrigation and power generation are not effective as envisaged.

The authors' preference is for the financial explanation, though this does not amount to complete disavowal of the responsibility of structural factors in precipitating the crisis. The financial collapse was the logical culmination of an inappropriate financial liberalisation strategy with volatile capital flows acting as a triggering factor. The IMF's misdiagnosis played a part in aggravating the crisis and in prolonging its duration. Ever since the outbreak of the crisis, speculation has been rife about the likelihood of the contagion spreading and the extent of its possible spread. Policy-makers in different countries have been exercised about measures to forestall the spread to their respective economies. The authors address these and related issues with respect to the two Asian giants, India and China.||Ajit S. Bhalla,Dilip M. Nachane

For one, not only have the working and middle classes grown, but youth groups have become politically more mobile. The general discontent with the despotic political system has accentuated with the drought and the current economic crisis. The risk is great that Indonesia is headed for a period of wider political violence.||Olle Tornquist

It begins to seem likely that the BJP-led government would be willing to settle for a cosmetic, face-saving concession from the lords of the global nuclear imperium, rather than a substantive one.||S.

Yet, this counter-utopia to the collapsed real socialism is also demonstrably bankrupt. But far more disturbing is the disorientation of the middle way democratic regimes which are finding increasingly difficult to strike the right balance between public and private, market and planning, short-term contingencies and long-term visions informed by ideals of social justice and harmony with nature. Yet the search for the third way constitutes the most promising path to explore. Rather than mimetically reproducing readymade blueprints brought from abroad, the challenge is to put to work social imagination to evolve endogenous solutions that will respond to the singularities of each country, be rooted in its intellectual and political history and take advantage of other countries' experiences.||Ignacy Sachs

In this article, we examine if and how these economic reforms have affected the behaviour of Indian stock prices. To address this issue we employ recently developed non-parametric variance ratio tests spanning a sample period of July 1957 to October 1996. Our study shows that from the mid-1980s, aggregate equity prices in India behaved like a random walk suggesting that Indian stock prices obeyed Fama's efficient market hypothesis after the beginning of the economic reforms. We also find that, to some extent, this progress towards efficiency was thwarted after the infamous scam of September 1991-May 1992.||Parantap Basu,Matthew R. Morey

The variegated symbols of religion as culture had enthused nationalists of many hues and colours but had seldom embittered relations between religious communities until they were flaunted to boast the power of majoritarian triumphalism. The conceits of unitary nationalism may well have caused a deeper sense of alienation among those defined as minorities than the attachment to diverse religions. The territorial claims of a minority-turned-nation heaped further confusion on the furious contest over sovereignty in the dying days of the raj. Having failed to share sovereignty in the manner of their pre-colonial forbears, late-colonial nationalist worshippers of the centralised state ended up dividing the land. Surely godless nationalism linked to the colonial categories of religious majorities and minorities has much to answer for.||Sugata Bose

This is done by first examining basic philosophical divides between the treatment of water as a commodity versus a common heritage. Customary and statutory rights structures governing groundwater and surface water in India are discussed next followed by current debates over reform. Thoughts toward a new rights and governance structure drawing on key features in existing practice are then outlined. In conclusion, the author argues that governance structures must be designed to create a balance of power in water use decisions between private (either individual or group) right holders and common rights that reflect the common heritage nature of water resources.||Marcus Moench

The basis for these alliances, as in the example of West Bengal, has been to form regional ties with state opposition political formations whose primary concern is the defeat of particular ruling parties at the state level. In order to facilitate its alliance strategy, the BJP has been forced to adopt a political style which is as accommodating as possible for an avowedly 'ideological' party. Whether the particular regional alliance between the Trinamul and the BJP in West Bengal can be maintained is perhaps secondary to the short-term efficacy of the alliance in allowing the state unit of the party to gain an electoral foothold in the state for the first time. Nevertheless, given the highly third opposition vote, shifting between opposition formations within the state on the basis of their perceived viability as an opposition force, the relation between the BJP and the Trinamul leaderships is one characterised by considerable rivalry, as both parties attempt to place themselves at the forefront of opposition politics. [This is the second of two papers on the transformation of opposition politics in West Bengal. The first paper, by James Mayers, appeared in the issue of August 15, 1998.]||Michael Gillan

Bombay Assembly Debates on Maternity Benefit Bill, 1929||The discussions on the Bombay Maternity Benefit Bill, 1929, have focused so far on the needs of capital, and left unexplored the role and needs of the colonial state as well as the reconstitution of patriarchy within the working class family and the sphere of wage-work. This paper, by focusing on Bombay legislative assembly debates over the maternity benefit bill in 1929, seeks to highlight these other untouched discourses, such as on nationalism, on ideology of protection entailed in the legal rights for women workers, on construction of working class by upper and middle class perception, and on the disciplinary aspects of legal regulation.

One must try to understand its logic within the terms of the Sangh parivar discourse in order to appreciate the full implications of what we have to confront today. And there is need too for some introspection. The 'euphoria' or 'national consensus' around Pokhran has been certainly very much exaggerated. Yet it cannot be denied that support for the tests came - to a fortunately diminishing extent, is still coming - also from quarters that have been often strongly critical of the hindutva combine, as well as from large numbers of people who are not firm supporters of the BJP, but generally uninterested in politics. Nor can the hesitations and ambiguities among the Left (and more generally, secular and democratic formations) be ignored. The author here explores what might lie behind such attitudes: in particular, a dangerously limited appreciation of the horrors of nuclear (indeed, all large-scale modern) war, and inadequate thinking about the problematic aspects of nationalism.||Sumit Sarkar

After examining the nature of the integration process, the author discusses some of the domestic factors and their interface with the external factors. The final section of the paper is concerned with whether the currency crises and the associated economic crises affecting this group of countries can be regarded as self-fulfilling prophecies on the part of the international community or whether they were entirely predictable results of unsound macro-economic fundamentals, with the focus of the discussion being on whether all the 'fundamentals' are equally important in this regard and what part financial liberalisation and capital account mobility have played in bringing about the present situation.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

By use of simple before and after comparisons made possible by the publication of the 50th survey round of the NSSO on employment and unemployment in India, the exclusive impact of liberalisation is assessed. The demand for labour increased after liberalisation but the increase was not shared evenly in rural and urban India between men and women, and regular and casual workers. By and large, the demand for casual and intermittent work increased faster than for durable, regular work. The structure of employment moved away from the primary sector for rural men, but rural women lost in employment, real wages and the share of primary sector in their employment increased. Gender-based inequality in earnings of casual workers was reduced but that in the earnings of regular workers increased. Liberalisation has affected casual workers, particularly the women casual workers, more favourably than regular workers.||Sudha Deshpande,Lalit Deshpande

This accommodative stance has not allowed the government to rein in the fiscal deficit and the budgetary targets may not be met. New measures are needed to strengthen the institutional weaknesses of the financial system such as raising liability limits on shareholders, giving tax sops for NPAs taken off the books of banks, and limiting entry into banking. With indirect taxes still a dominant source of revenue, the exemption limit for personal taxes needs to be reduced and all savings exempted from such taxation so that the introduction of a full-fledged VAT is not regressive.

This paper focuses on a relatively neglected dimension of the Indian economic reform process - the institutional underpinnings of state capacity. It has argued that state capacity, defined as the capability for political management of the reform process within a democratic system, is crucial for the sustainability of the reforms.

Fifty years after independence is an opportune moment to revise and reconsider established theories on partition, introduce a more nuanced discourse and stay clear of the conventional wisdom on the theme of 'communal' politics. Contrary to the exaggerated claims made in both the countries, most people were either indifferent to or unconcerned with the national borders or the newly-created geographical territories that were being laboriously created. Creative writings of a host of novelists and poets on the partition especially expose the inadequacy of numerous narratives on independence and partition, and compel us to explore fresh themes and adopt new approaches that have eluded the grasp of social scientists. If histories of partition are to be re-written, then creative writings provide a foundation for developing an alternative discourse to current expositions of a general theory on inter-community relations.||Mushirul Hasan

Although the structures and social composition of formal political parties mattered substantially, the striking contrast between India and Pakistan as also between the military rulers in West Pakistan and the Awami League leaders in East Pakistan (later Bangladesh) was the charisma, popular appeal and moral authority of individual Congress leaders and their extraordinary legitimacy in many parts of the country and among different sections of society. Today if the critique of the Gandhian and Nehruvian legacies carries weight and conviction, the responsibility rests primarily with the Congress Party. It has failed to harness its own ideological resources to mobilise the minorities, the backward castes and the dalits.||Mushirul Hasan

The attempt at creating a zone of monetary stability in Europe and the worldwide crisis of capitalist accumulation belong together. EMU amounts to an institutional attempt at buttressing domestic policies of austerity with a supranational anchor and the establishment of an anti-inflationary police force that seeks to protect member states from speculative runs by securing the right of private property internally. It moreover seeks to de-politicise the attack on labour movements and to reinforce and exploit its regional and national fragmentation.||Werner Bonefeld

While this understanding has served in the last five decades to empower citizens there is a need today to rethink the emancipatory potential of rights as they are conceived by contemporary social movements. The following set of five papers was written in response to this position paper, around which a conference, Clture, Rights and the Culture of Rights, was organised at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in March 1996.||

Though the communists have gained immensely by securing absolute control over the government, gross human rights violation and suspension of external assistance have begun to tell on Cambodia's economy. In such circumstances, the entire development process is in danger of falling prey to fresh political manipulation, sporadic military action, insecurity and the ever-present danger of another lapse into social-economic isolation.||

For reversing industrial deceleration, this paper advocates a thrust on technological change and networking for the small and medium firms. For the public sector, this paper suggests that rather than selling a majority of their stocks to private firms at the current depressed stock prices, profit-sharing schemes for workers be introduced through equity sharing. It also advocates encouragement for small and medium firms to set up micro power plants based on molasses, wind and solar energy. To make the stock market more broad-based, remove possible malpractices and increase the small investor's confidence, this paper favours the introduction of compulsory depository system in addition to stock option for workers.||N.

Whereas in the past there were multiple forms of water conservation, the colonial period put major emphasis on wells, and its active encouragement to the use of mechanised pumps led to unsustainable extraction of groundwater since early 20th century. Neverthelss, it would be untrue as has been argued, to attribute the current water crisis to commercialisation of agriculture accompanied by rise of so-called economic individualism during the colonial period. As this paper argues, the colonial rule did not destroy the traditional hierarchical 'village communities', but rather by granting property in land and rights to water, it modified as well as strengthened their basis of power. It is this system which continues to deprive the rural poor from access to resources, and only recourse to a variety of local systems of water harvesting suited to the topography of particular area and controlled by those who need it, can do away with the inequitous system of water harvesting and distribution.||David Hardiman

But though his vision has been politicised, made to bear witness to a non-brahmin and, in some instances, a Tamil will to power, it, yet, resists a complete co-optation into politics. It intimates to the interlocutor of today an abiding ethic which is not at all explicable in terms of quotidian politics. It is this ethic which is the subject of this paper and an attempt is made to explore it for the lessons it may hold out for contemporary feminist debate and practice.||V. Geetha

It takes a positive view of globalisation as promoting efficiency and enabling high-productivity, high-wage jobs. The report does not hold labour market rigidities as responsible for unemployment in either industrialised or developing countries. The macro-economic environment-appropriate fiscal policy, wage setting institutions, and welfare programmes - is seen as central to growth and employment creation. The report downplays the fact that there is little room for fiscal manoeuvre in most countries so that interest rates may rise or that debt-deflation or the size of the welfare state may be responsible for the economic downturn in industrialised countries. Moreover, balanced growth is not a good option for developing countries as it results in enlarging low-paid, dead-end, informal sector jobs.||Errol D'Souza

But banking sector reforms initiated as part of the liberalisation programme, since the beginning of the 1990s, has almost brought the priority sector lending policy to a halt. Moreover, the position of the poorer states in regard to priority sector bank credit seems to have worsened because of the manner in which priority sector targeting has been done by linking it to total bank credit rather than to bank deposits.||K.

The specific problem addressed is that of explaining fertility decline under conditions of persisting absolute poverty. The analysis is set in the context of broader socio-economic and demographic trends in Bangladesh during recent decades. It is evident that the complex dynamics of fertility decline cannot be simply deduced from rates of poverty incidence. In fact there does not appear to be any unique relationship between the incidence of poverty and the direction of fertility trends.||Shapan Adnan

So, is the creation of Europe as a more powerful 'imagined community' a practical possibility? Firstly, the development of a sense of national identity took a long time to develop and had to be re-enforced by state driven education, imperial conquests and wars. Secondly, the development of a European identity faces a powerful challenge from national identity whereas when national identity began to be developed its main challenge was localism and particularism which often lacked means of legitimation and defence other than an appeal to perceived custom. Thirdly, although the 'national' emerged in the context of the development of a growing capitalist world economy, the internationalising elements were much less powerful than they are today. Just as the global undercuts the 'nation', so it also undercuts the idea of 'super-nation' and provides basis for other identities and other potential polarisations and possibilities.||Michael Haynes,Katherine Pinnock

Though, currently, the Bahujan Samaj Party commands the allegiance of a large number of jatavs, it should not be overlooked that the roots of self-assertion of jatavs of western UP go back to the process of Ambedkarisation initiated by the Republican Party of India in the 1960s.||Jagpal Singh

Conforming to the general pattern, the weak and unstable BJP political leadership has cited perceived threats to national security from external adversaries as a reason to go openly nuclear. Yet, the power such nuclear status spawns has in an environment of weakly institutionalised democracy an endemic propensity for excesses. Hence the need for greater concern to the norms of democratic governance in India after Pokhran than ever before. But equally, the present Indian regime's decision on nuclear explosion is a direct consequence of the globalisation of the US paradigm of national security inaugurated after the second world war. After the collapse of the Nehruvian non-alignment which prioritised economic development, social transformation and national integration over and above military build-up, the replication of western version of security establishments mushroomed new culture of realpolitik since the 1960s in India and has led to the present brinkmanship at Pokhran.||Aswini K.

Two issues need to be highlighted. Firstly, studies show that an alarmingly large number of children do not become literate even after four years of schooling. Therefore school effectiveness and actual learning have to be central rather than secondary concerns for universal elementary education. Secondly, how effective schools are and success in learning depend not only on school level inputs but also on factors outside the school. For genuine universal elementary education, the impact of the wider context on schooling has to be understood better. Measures that mitigate the worst effects of poverty on children and creation of rural infrastructure are necessary for education that is effective and empowering.||Rashmi Sharma

How did they problematise their particular present? The theme of maternity, it is argued here, is an important way in which to comprehend the complex negotiations involved in interrogating the role envisaged for women in independent India. Ashapurna Debi's trilogy, the first of which was written in this period, telling the story of three generations of women, sees the 19th century as the originary moment for the formation of women as subjects of their own discourses. However, it is precisely Ashapurna Debi's location in the 20th century and in the post-independent Indian state that compels her to frame the problem in ways that challenge colonial, reformist and nationalist notions of maternity.||Indira Chowdhury

This article seeks to contribute to the debate on the changing nature of Russian external economic relations. In particular, the article sheds light both on the extent to which the decline in domestic economic performance is reflected in external relations and how and to what extent foreign trade and investment influences restructuring the domestic economy. Whilst the development of foreign trade policies is clearly of pivotal importance to the restructuring of the economy, western policy responses are another determinant. Thus, in the last part examine western responses to Russian re-integration into the world economy focusing in particular on the response of the European Union are examined. A closer analysis of the issues suggests that neither Russian reforms nor western responses give rise to optimism about the Russian transition path.||Silke Machold

In the third world, Freire's locus of theorising, there seems to be no end to the sharp contradiction between the primary functions of education; its selective or certifying function and its role in enhancing the intellectual capital of society.

The success of Mamata Banerjee's breakaway Trinamul Congress, together with a dramatic increase in support for the BJP, has relegated the Congress(I) to the periphery of electoral politics in that state. The results can be seen as confirmation of the Congress(I) rank and file's declining faith in the leadership of the party in West Bengal and a rejection of its accommodating stance towards the ruling Left Front. Although it would appear premature at this stage to suggest that the Trinamul Congress constitutes a realisation of the historical potential for the emergence in West Bengal of a specifically regionally-oriented Congress freed from the constraints of the party's central leadership, the split in the state Congress should nevertheless be viewed as symptomatic of a wider malaise within the party's organisational structure and should send a clear message to the party hierarchy in New Delhi that any rejuvanation of that structure needs to have its genesis at the state level and below.||James Mayers

To recover the cost of bribery, firms hide their production output which then remains unrecorded in the official statistics. Hence, by estimating the unrecorded income of the industrial sector, it is possible to examine the growth of corruption. A method for estimating sectoral unrecorded income is suggested in this paper, and from the estimated unrecorded income of the industrial sector we demonstrate that the large increases in corruption signalled by recent reported cases are justifiable. Our empirical results also suggest that the disaggregated 'hidden economy' estimates are more informative than aggregated estimates.||Dilip K. Bhattacharyya,Susmita Ghose

It then formalises these links within an analytical framework which, by highlighting the concept of the 'high-interest trap', suggests that, for any given deficit, there exists optimal levels of monetisation and market borrowings. The model is then applied to evaluate the implications of the Union Budget 1998-99 and the results indicate that unless government borrowings are reduced substantially, the inflation rate would be much higher than what the fundamentals require it to be.||M.

This anomalous attitude towards a weak-formidable enemy spawned India's embrace of nuclearisation which was seen as guaranteeing India global prestige and equation with China besides regional primacy and a way out for its contested nationalism.||Iftikhar H.

On finding through a statistical test that primary and intermediate inputs are not separable in the production function, the present analysis proceeds with an estimation of TFP on the basis of output in place of the usually preferred variable 'value added' in the Indian studies. As a fall-out of such a step, the growth recorded by TFP is found to have a positive trend with a marked deceleration during the 1980s. Such a result, therefore, enabled the study to come up with a conclusion that there was no 'turn around' in TFP growth during the 1980s as has been pointed out recently. Extending the TFP estimation to a selected set of industries, identified by the Central Pollution Control Board, New Delhi, to be amongst the most polluting ones, it has been found difficult to substantiate either the claim of a turn around in the growth path of TFP during the 1980s or the option of value added as an appropriate choice for its estimation in the Indian industrial sector. An important finding of the present exercise is one of TFP in India following a fluctuating growth path.||Gopinath Pradhan,Kaustuva Barik

This period has also witnessed a growth of an informal credit market with a new lending class comprising traders (of HYV, fertilisers and pesticides), catering to the working capital needs of the farmers. A survey of Hugli district of West Bengal shows a high dependence of the small and marginal farmers on this market. Deprived of the relatively cheaper credit from the formal institutions these farmers are compelled to depend on high interest bearing loans for productive purposes and thereby face the risk of falling into a vicious cycle of perennial indebtedness.||Meenakshi Rajeev,Sharmistha Deb

This paper, based on a survey of field-level investigations, addresses the issues of economic constraints, schooling quality and parental motivation as a set of possible influences determining the educational decisions within a household and contributing to the overall picture of educational deprivation at the national level. The author finds an exaggerated emphasis being placed on child labour and inadequate motivation among poor parents as the major obstacles to universalisation of primary education. Rather, it is the direct costs of schooling, which impose substantial burden on families, and the low quality of schooling facilities, which reduce the child's interest in education, that primarily account for educational deprivation. In both these aspects - reducing private costs of schooling and improving schooling quality - the state has a crucial role to play. But there are few signs that the government is addressing these problems. This paper appears in two parts. The first part, published here, interrogates the belief that poverty is the main cause of educational deprivation in India, and draws attention to the largely unexplored area of poor quality of schooling as an important factor affecting educational performance.||Kiran Bhatty

However, such a process of social development without a commensurate transformation of the productive sectors has presented Kerala with some major dilemmas. This paper therefore takes a critical look at the political economy of labour and development by examining the roles of labour unions, state, and capital. The three dilemmas relate to (i) technological choice in the face of high and rising labour costs in labour-intensive activities for maximising long-term growth and employment, (ii) mismatch between labour-supply and labour demand as a result of changing job expectations of the younger generation in a technologically stagnant economy, and (iii) lack of new investment despite growing loanable funds and declining resistance to technological change. The failure of labour unions to agree to productivity improvements through technological changes and increasingly resorting to 'closed shop' strategies has been particularly emphasised.||K. P. Kannan

This issue is relevant from both academic and policy angle. The rehabilitation policies for the disabled have so far been designed 'as if' the incidence of disability and the cost or the wherewithals for rehabilitation are gender neutral. This is unrealistic. The note analyses state-level data for four types of disabilities: visual, hearing, speech and locomotor. In the hypothetical situation of gender neutrality, a graph of the male versus female disability will be a straight line passing through origin and having a unit slope. Deviation from this linear relationship will indicate a gender bias in the incidence of that form of disability.||D. Das,S. B. Agnihotri

In both these aspects - reducing private costs of schooling and improving schooling quality - the state has a crucial role to play. But there are few signs that the government is addressing these problems. The first part of this paper appeared in last issue. This concluding part focuses on the social prejudices and infrastructural bottlenecks that ultimately shape parental motivation in favour of education of their male offsprings, thus implanting gender inequality in the formative years of life.||Kiran Bhatty

Yet, puzzlingly, in several countries over the past few years the fund managers have continued to pour in funds, ignoring the disturbing signals about the state of these economies that were coming out. Clearly, the global fund managers could not have behaved as they did unless they were sure that they would be protected against the consequences of their miscalculations and misjudgments. To extend such protection is the purpose of the rescue packages and bail-out strategies so that the near-default crises in the borrowing countries and the imposition of conditionalities provide a bonanza for the global investment bankers and the fund managers who can go on playing their games as they have always played them, safe in the knowledge that they would be rescued, if and when necessary.||D.

It attempts to provide a backdrop against which the government can be held accountable for failure in respect of its obligation to take appropriate steps to prevent such abuse of women.||Shireen J.

Moreover, it is argued that short time duration between rice-wheat crop rotation has led to sub-optimal land preparation and sub-optimal use of other inputs, causing reduction in yield of rice and wheat. While refuting any plateauing or stagnation in yield of rice and wheat, this paper nevertheless suggests that besides technological improvement, strengthening infrastructural facilities and initiating better land and water management through participatory approach can go some way in addressing the problems confronting the rice-wheat system in the Indo-Gangetic region.||Ramesh Chand,T.

If English were to remain the only easily available Indian language for computer use and if we make the reasonable assumption that access to computers (and to computer-based electronic communications) is empowering, then 95 per cent of the Indian people who do not know good enough English for computer use will automatically be disempowered.

The government has shown little seriousness in creating the necessary confidence by stricter regulation to ensure that Corporate India behaves more responsibly towards investors. On the contrary, some of the government's proposals, incorporated in the Companies Bill pending before parliament, are bound to reduce corporate managements' accountability to shareholders. Corporate managements' accountability to shareholders is the central problem.||L. C. Gupta

The latter hypothesis is tested here on Indian states over the Plan period using OLS regression. For this purpose, a physical infrastructure development indicator is formulated with the help of principal component analysis. With various unavoidable data limitations, the results are significantly conclusive: first, regional disparity has been rising in recent period, and Plan outlay has not played any major role in this regard; second, regional imbalance in physical infrastructure has been found to be responsible for rising income disparity across the states.||Buddhadeb Ghosh,Prabir De

Nevertheless, the fact remains that the CAS have come to realise the desirability of mutual exchange and hope greater success in near future.||R. Sampath Kumar

08/8/1998-14/8/1998||special articles||4407076||Nation, Reason and Religion: Punjab's Role in the Partition of India||The pre-eminent view of Indian nationalism has been that of an inclusionary, accommodative, consensual and popular anti-colonial struggle. This has entailed denigrating the exclusive affinities of religion as 'communal' in an imagined hierarchy of collectivities crowned by the ideal of a 'nation' unsullied by narrowminded bigotry. By implying that religious affiliations are, if not necessarily bigoted, then certainly less worthy than identifications with the 'nation', Indian nationalism comes dangerously close to trampling over its own coat-tails. The cultural roots of Indian nationalism owed far more to religious ideals, reinterpreted and reconfigured in imaginative fashion, than has been acknowledged. Continued recourse to the colonial privileging of religious distinctions thwarted many well-meaning attempts at accommodating differences within a broad framework of Indian nationalism. So long as the dominant discourse among Indians was tainted by notions of religious majoritarianism and minoritarianism there could be no hard and fast separation between 'nationalism' and 'communalism'. Far from being an irritating side-show, the inversion of the all-India majority and minority equation in Punjab was at the centre-stage of the struggle between nationalism and imperialism.||Ayesha Jalal
