The international community is steadily inching towards a global convention for the conservation of the unique variety of the biological resources of the planet. Notwithstanding the international concern, for in situ conservation of biodiversity to be a reality, its local human conservers ought to be 'socio-ecologic communities' inhabiting an 'ecological' space. This paper analyses why such local conditions do not obtain in India and why the 'modern' local self-governments of India do not capture the 'ecologic' geometry of biodiversity conservation.||A.

Hunger, when addressed, is seen as simply one additional exacerbating factor in the sub-continent's epidemic history. Little attempt has been made to assess the relative contribution of the parasitic versus 'nutritional' sides of the epidemic equation. In part, this reflects the technical difficulties involved in such a task. But it is also the result of an as yet inadequate conceptual approach to the subject of hunger in history more generally. This study is an initial effort to assess the role of hunger in the specific sense of acute starvation as a factor in south Asian epidemic patterns across the colonial period. It does so in the context of the enormous socioeconomic shifts which occurred with the commercialisation of India's agricultural economy across the second half of the 19th and early 20th century, and the implications of these and the administrative changes with respect to precariousness of access to food.||Sheila Zurbrigg

First, the geological structure of the Himalayas is such that any major tampering with it can be dangerous. Second, local wisdom and local experience should not be treated with the supercilious contempt that our experts generally bestow upon them. Finally, vague talk of ecology and environment is unwarranted; only a multidisciplinary study can tell us what is best for the ecology.||Arun Ghosh

However, the emotional commitment of environmentalists to protecting the environment has not been matched by their understanding of the complexities of the issues involved. An example of this is the way in which they greatly exaggerated the detrimental effects of India's social forestry programme, while ignoring its positive aspects. All too often, in movements for social change, concern over issues degenerates into rigid ideological beliefs. In this paper it is argued that environmentalists have fallen into the same trap-bringing into question their ability to constructively intervene in the development debate.||Michael Burgess

So we have to begin on two fronts: one, reviewing our mistakes, and two, opening ourselves up to the natural communicating environment by looking at real situations in natural groups of varying size. Perhaps our admissions and observations will lead to the birth of a new paradigm, where control will give way to consensus, and certainty to an open-ended future of change, renewal and surprise.||Peggy Mohan

This essay takes up yet a third alternative, the provision of an intellectual genealogy for the movement. The concern here is with those forgotten thinkers in India who, in a rational, reflective mode, provided important insights into people's relationship with nature.||Ramachandra Guha

Coming as it does so close to the Rio Earth Summit, the GATT report is likely to cast its shadow on the summit.||Biswajit Dhar

While population growth might have exacerbated the crisis it is certainly not the source of it. If the neo-Malthusian prescriptions currently being offered are followed, not only will human rights in the third world stand compromised, but the real reasons for the environmental disorder will remain unaddressed.||Aseem Shrivastava

Some Evidence from Rajasthan||The dominant view contends that vast tracts of common grazing land are wastelands to be greened in the wake of the environmental crisis confronting the country's arid and semi-arid zones. Clearly there can be no definition of wasteland other than that which draws attention to its defining feature of uselessness. What is to be investigated then, is whether this land and its produce, if any, has a use value at all. This article, based on a study in the Sikar district of Rajasthan, juxtaposes the state's view (incorporating the scientists' definition) of wastelands to the villagers' perception of the commons which draws its characteristics and validity from the shared context of local inhabitants.||Rita Brara
