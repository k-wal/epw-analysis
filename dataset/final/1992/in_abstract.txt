The international community is steadily inching towards a global convention for the conservation of the unique variety of the biological resources of the planet. Notwithstanding the international concern, for in situ conservation of biodiversity to be a reality, its local human conservers ought to be 'socio-ecologic communities' inhabiting an 'ecological' space. This paper analyses why such local conditions do not obtain in India and why the 'modern' local self-governments of India do not capture the 'ecologic' geometry of biodiversity conservation.||A.

However, a number of deeper questions have not received adequate attention: Who owns groundwater resources? Who benefits from their use? Who causes and who suffers from their overexploitation? How can proper utilisation of these resources to meet real needs be ensured? This study focuses on two alarming aspects of the present water utilisation patterns in Gujarat: overexploitation and inequity. The aspect of overexploitation has been investigated from macro data and the inequity aspect, in the absence of secondary data at the village level, through a case study of eight villages in Sabarkantha district.||Bela Bhatia

Hunger, when addressed, is seen as simply one additional exacerbating factor in the sub-continent's epidemic history. Little attempt has been made to assess the relative contribution of the parasitic versus 'nutritional' sides of the epidemic equation. In part, this reflects the technical difficulties involved in such a task. But it is also the result of an as yet inadequate conceptual approach to the subject of hunger in history more generally. This study is an initial effort to assess the role of hunger in the specific sense of acute starvation as a factor in south Asian epidemic patterns across the colonial period. It does so in the context of the enormous socioeconomic shifts which occurred with the commercialisation of India's agricultural economy across the second half of the 19th and early 20th century, and the implications of these and the administrative changes with respect to precariousness of access to food.||Sheila Zurbrigg

Well numbers have increased dramatically since the 1950s and overdraft and saline intrusion problems have become major issues in some locations. The overall magnitude of overdevelopment problems, their potential social implications, and existing management options are, however, unclear. The purpose of this paper is to examine selected ground water issues and discuss potential policy implications. An introductory overview is presented first. This is followed by brief analyses of the causes of overdevelopment, key information gaps in understanding the magnitude of ground water problems, and potential management alternatives. Policy implications are discussed in the final section.||Marcus Moench

First, the geological structure of the Himalayas is such that any major tampering with it can be dangerous. Second, local wisdom and local experience should not be treated with the supercilious contempt that our experts generally bestow upon them. Finally, vague talk of ecology and environment is unwarranted; only a multidisciplinary study can tell us what is best for the ecology.||Arun Ghosh

03/10/1992- ||special articles||4398971||Dangers of Environmental Extremism: Analysis of Debate over India's Social Forestry Programme||The recent growth in concern for the environmental problems of developing countries is a welcome development. However, the emotional commitment of environmentalists to protecting the environment has not been matched by their understanding of the complexities of the issues involved. An example of this is the way in which they greatly exaggerated the detrimental effects of India's social forestry programme, while ignoring its positive aspects. All too often, in movements for social change, concern over issues degenerates into rigid ideological beliefs. In this paper it is argued that environmentalists have fallen into the same trap-bringing into question their ability to constructively intervene in the development debate.||Michael Burgess

So we have to begin on two fronts: one, reviewing our mistakes, and two, opening ourselves up to the natural communicating environment by looking at real situations in natural groups of varying size. Perhaps our admissions and observations will lead to the birth of a new paradigm, where control will give way to consensus, and certainty to an open-ended future of change, renewal and surprise.||Peggy Mohan

In the process, it raises certain basic theoretical issues and argues against using high rates of discount when the cash flows are at constant prices. The viability is proved through all the three criteria-NPV, BCRs and IRRs, and on the basis of direct benefits only. Inclusion of indirect benefits would have shown the economic viability to be even higher. What is more, social forestry pays for itself and it is no charity to rural areas. The projects can be financially viable even after meeting the bio-mass needs of the local poor. The paper makes its biases and assumptions quite explicit. The direction of biases is to test the viability as rigorously as is reasonable.||M. V. Nadkarni,K. N. Ninan,Syed Ajmal Pasha

Groundwater Irrigation, Growth of Agricultural Production, and Poverty in Bangladesh||For many years the potential for economic development and poverty alleviation in areas of eastern India and Bangladesh has been sought through the development of water resources especially the exploitation of groundwater since the early 1970s. This paper discusses the experiences of Bangladesh with groundwater irrigation, agricultural growth and poverty alleviation and argues that the apparently largely beneficial development of groundwater in the country has had little to do with deliberate policies for managing groundwater. Maintaining in the future the serendipity of the past decade will require continuing agricultural and industrial growth and adequate support for the poor.||R. W. Palmer-Jones

Depletion tends to disproportionately affect the poor by further limiting their access to the resource. Unfortunately, the same can be said for most management alternatives other than supply creation. Inherent tensions exist between equitable access to groundwater resources and management options to ensure sustainable use. New institutional approaches-similar, for example, to those used in joint forest management-are required which can incorporate both equity and sustainability goals. This paper reviews emerging groundwater degradation issues in Gujarat and their implications for equitable resource access. Current management practices and proposed alternatives are examined from both resource sustainability and access equity perspectives. Innovative institutional approaches based on user-groups are discussed and their viability is examined through lessons from the management of other common pool resources. It is argued that the dual goals of sustainability and equity may be best served through management institutions based on local user groups.||Marcus H. Moench

Why does this progressive and industrially advanced state have to suffer such an ignoble water scarcity after four decades of planned development? And, above all, why is it that chief ministers and ministers come and go, and political fortunes of parties too rise and fall, often dramatically, but the non-availability of safe and adequate drinking water to the common man and woman in rural Maharashtra continues unabated? Answers to these questions will have to be searched for within the framework of Maharashtra's political economy in general and the kinds of regional imbalances that were inherent in the process of planned economic development and in the power-structures that sprang up from the growth process.||D.

While their rights have been enlarged, their obligations have been considerably watered down. This marks a reversal of the spirit of the 70s when the issue in international negotiations was how to make technology transfer between the north and the south more equitable. The TRIPS negotiations have focused exclusively on the monopoly rights of patentees from developed countries and, in doing so, all the issues raised in the debates on the 'Code of Conduct for Transfer of Technology' and the 'Code of Conduct for Multinational Corporations' have been conveniently forgotten. The developing countries have to contend with an unequal world order. This is the most important message of the Dunkel draft on TRIPS.||Biswajit Dhar,C. Niranjan Rao

Some Evidence from Rajasthan||The dominant view contends that vast tracts of common grazing land are wastelands to be greened in the wake of the environmental crisis confronting the country's arid and semi-arid zones. Clearly there can be no definition of wasteland other than that which draws attention to its defining feature of uselessness. What is to be investigated then, is whether this land and its produce, if any, has a use value at all. This article, based on a study in the Sikar district of Rajasthan, juxtaposes the state's view (incorporating the scientists' definition) of wastelands to the villagers' perception of the commons which draws its characteristics and validity from the shared context of local inhabitants.||Rita Brara
