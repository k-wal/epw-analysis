The international community is steadily inching towards a global convention for the conservation of the unique variety of the biological resources of the planet. Notwithstanding the international concern, for in situ conservation of biodiversity to be a reality, its local human conservers ought to be 'socio-ecologic communities' inhabiting an 'ecological' space. This paper analyses why such local conditions do not obtain in India and why the 'modern' local self-governments of India do not capture the 'ecologic' geometry of biodiversity conservation.||A.

While paying lip-service to these differences, the tragedy and pathos of official cultural discourse is that it assumes a unitary position that subsumes all contradictions within predetermined and homogenised categories and premises. While this makes for an ordered, and occasionally eloquent, discourse, with high-sounding humanist sentiments, it also affirms an 'integral' view of Indian culture which is illusory, if not downright false. A most nuanced example of such discourse is available for scrutiny in the much-awaited and sadly-neglected report of the Haksar Committee. This essay questions the basic terms of reference which are raised in the report to provide the beginnings of a critique of official cultural discourse in India.||Rustom Bharucha

This paper is a study of indigenous techniques used in textile production. The structural and orgnisational features of the industry were interwined with the technology in use, which also determined the responses of the system to the challenges of modern technology and factory production, independent of exogenous historical developments like the beginning of colonial rule. The details of techniques also contribute to an understanding of the totally different concepts and values regarding productivity and cost effectiveness in the indigenous system.||Kanakalatha Mukund

Presented here are findings on female infanticide for a rural south Indian population. These data were collected as part of a major four-year field study on child growth and survival in a 13,000 population and have been confirmed directly with the families concerned. Female infanticide is practised in only 6 of the 12 study villages affecting about 10 per cent of new-born girls. Reported here are the demographic consequences and social factors associated with this are considered. Seventy-two per cent of all female deaths were due to femicide and misclassification of these deaths would grossly distort the significant child survival achieved by this population.||Sabu George,Rajaratnam Abel,B.

'Waste' is one such idea with an ascriptive dimension, and is therefore politically powerful. The permanent Settlement in Bengal was deeply concerned with the issue of 'waste'. This essay attempts to understand how the English represented and applied the concept of 'waste' in Bengal and contends that the idea of 'waste' is richer and more politically significant than most histories of the Permanent Settlement have indicated.||Vinay Krishin Gidwani

In the periphery, it was China's Cultural Revolution in the 60s that brought the practice of workers control on the agenda once again. But theory and scholarship perhaps did not respond as much to the occasion in the third world and in China itself there were serious aberrations and ultimately, degeneration. In this note we put forward some hypotheses regarding deskilling and capitalist control in Indian industry, issues that have a bearing on the quality of workers' lives. This is not a report or finished work but an outline of a research agenda. In Section I we briefly review the labour process literature-Marx, Braverman and post-Braverman. In Section II we attempt to see what insights can be gained from this literature for the study of the labour process in Indian industry. We also draw from our experience of a few years as a participant-observer in modern Indian industry in the 70s. In a sense, this is a first landing on and take-off from a rough terrain.||Bernard D'Mello

First, the policy of across-the-board delicensing and the proposed repealing of the MRTP Act which together would go considerably towards reducing the barriers to entry into the Indian industrial sector. Second, freer attitude towards foreign collaborations, technical as well as financial and, especially, the open-door policy towards direct foreign investment. Third, the clearer articulation of policy with respect to reforming the public sector and, specifically, subjecting certain sectors which were hitherto reserved exclusively for the public sector to competition from the private sector and also the divesting of a portion of the equity of going public sector concerns.

The first section of the paper discusses the momentum of population growth since independence and examines the prospects of reducing its growth rate in future. This section analyses the crucial role of social and human development in influencing fertility rates and shows how little emphasis was placed on promoting these objectives in Indian planning. The second section is devoted to a detailed examination of the relationship between foodgrains production and population growth. This section examines the factors that determine the inter-state differences in foodgrains consumption and evaluates the role of the public distribution system in lessening the inequalities in consumption. The third and final section presents a broad analysis of a few important questions relating to labour market adjustments in response to population growth. This section touches upon the questions of the inadequacy of the concepts used in measuring employment and unemployment within the institutional and social structure prevailing in different parts of the country, the relationship between agricultural wages and agricultural productivity and the likely pressure on employment generated by the enormous increase in labour force during the next 35 years.||T.

This consciousness has been born out of real threats to their traditional way of life and the perception of threat has strengthened and fostered their 'we-feeling'. Regarding economic resources, the contention advanced here is that the tribals now known as the Jharkhandis are economically viable in a way that may disconcert traditional observers. With the help of data for Singhbhum district it is argued that a simple look at bank loans in the rural area provides hints of development possibilities in the tribal region.||Srabani Raichaudhuri

However, a number of deeper questions have not received adequate attention: Who owns groundwater resources? Who benefits from their use? Who causes and who suffers from their overexploitation? How can proper utilisation of these resources to meet real needs be ensured? This study focuses on two alarming aspects of the present water utilisation patterns in Gujarat: overexploitation and inequity. The aspect of overexploitation has been investigated from macro data and the inequity aspect, in the absence of secondary data at the village level, through a case study of eight villages in Sabarkantha district.||Bela Bhatia

15/8/1992- ||special articles||4398751||Making of a Payments Crisis: India 1991||Inflation erodes the real value of a nominal debt, and thereby confers a capital gain upon the debtor. Such capital gain resembles the so-called 'inflation tax', or what Cagan calls 'the tax on cash balances'. This paper recognises the inflation-induced capital gain to the government of India as a positive item in the budget; it is the other side of the Pigou effect. The fiscal deficit thus adjusted is relatively small in size and non-increasing over time. Hence, we conclude that the fiscal deficit and the current payments crisis in India are unrelated, contrary to the official claim. The secular decay of the total factor productivity observed in India's manufacturing industries is arguably the underlying reason for long-term strain on its balance of payments. In certain conjunctures it leads to a full-fledged crisis. The net profit on investment in India, on an average, seems stable over time; but the associated risk is presumably high and inoptimally distributed. A Pareto optimal allocation of risk among workers and investors can possibly stem capital flight and stimulate investment. The government has a central place in the economy to create dynamic comparative advantage.||Ranjit Sau

Such a position ignores the reality of increasing marriage break down among Catholics and the acceptance by informed and practising Catholics that in the event of marriage failure women suffer more and face greater difficulties. This article is a narrative of the nitty-gritty of working within the Catholic church to achieve a separation between marriage as a civil contract and an indissoluble sacrament. It seeks to argue that while the church has the right to continue its teachings on marriage as a permanent bond, it must also respect individual conscience.||Rita Monteiro

18/7/1992- ||special articles||4398664||'Kaliyuga', 'Chakri' and 'Bhakti': Ramakrishna and His Times||This essay examines a paradox of 19th century Bengal which was increasingly being moulded by the colonial encounter. The milieu was one in which, among other things, sacred texts had become more accessible, the printed word had acquired greater circulation, a foreign language had gained currency as the medium of higher instruction, time had begun to impose its own discipline, the interaction with a culture which elevated itself to a superior plane by virtue of its rationality and science had prompted recourse to self-consciously 'rational' arguments towards modification or defence of the 'traditional' and a premium had come to be placed on social activism such as education, religious and social reform, revivalism, philanthrophy and patriotic endeavour. Yet this milieu also witnessed the strange and sudden fascination that an obscure Dakshineshwar temple priest, Ramakrishna Paramahansa, a rustic brahman who knew barely any English, received little formal schooling, held rationalistic argument in contempt, was disdainful of book knowledge and asserted the futility of organised social reform, exercised over the Calcutta bhadralok. This phenomenon of the Ramakrishna cult reflects a two-way crossing of social frontiers-the rustic brahman becoming the guru of the city bhadralok, the latter falling under the spell of an idiom, values and personality different from their own. An exploration of both these trajectories offers scope for a comprehension of village culture and religion and the contradictions of bhadralok life.||Sumit Sarkar

Hunger, when addressed, is seen as simply one additional exacerbating factor in the sub-continent's epidemic history. Little attempt has been made to assess the relative contribution of the parasitic versus 'nutritional' sides of the epidemic equation. In part, this reflects the technical difficulties involved in such a task. But it is also the result of an as yet inadequate conceptual approach to the subject of hunger in history more generally. This study is an initial effort to assess the role of hunger in the specific sense of acute starvation as a factor in south Asian epidemic patterns across the colonial period. It does so in the context of the enormous socioeconomic shifts which occurred with the commercialisation of India's agricultural economy across the second half of the 19th and early 20th century, and the implications of these and the administrative changes with respect to precariousness of access to food.||Sheila Zurbrigg

However, as per the results corresponding to cross-section data and time-series-cross-section pooled data industrialisation with rapid employment growth is suggested as a policy variable for reducing urban poverty.||Arup Mitra

It argues that while the available data show little sign of excess mortality in Bihar, we probably cannot exclude this possibility. Certainly, mortality appears to have risen in the districts of southern Bihar, which were also those most affected by production failure. However, there is no doubt that there was substantial excess mortality during the Maharashtra drought-at the very least 70,000 excess deaths, and perhaps many more. The most interesting feature of the Maharashtra experience is that mortality rose most in those districts which were arguably least affected by production failures. The paper suggests some possible explanations for these very different experiences of Bihar and Maharashtra apropos the observed relationships between mortality increases and output declines. It expresses surprise that the available demographic material on these two significant crises have generally been neglected.||Tim Dyson,Arup Maharatna

If a full analysis of the commitment reveals its defensive function which has disabled Muslims from a creative opposition to the absolutists, and if, moreover, this function of the commitment is diagnosed as itself based on a deep but common philosophical fallacy, it should be possible then for moderate Muslims to think their way out of this conflict and to transform the nature of their commitment to Islam, so that it is not disabling in that way.||Akeel Bilgrami

This continues to be a matter of concern to policy-makers trying to correct the fiscal imbalance in the budget. This paper suggests that farmers, fertiliser industry and consumers of foodgrains all seem to be benefiting from this subsidy in one way or the other, and in varying degrees. The burden of readjustment, therefore, should fall on all the three fronts, almost simultaneously. On farmers' front, an increase in fertiliser prices must be absorbed through appropriate increases in support/procurement prices of main fertiliser consuming crops such as wheat, rice and cotton because the farmer is not 'net-subsidised' on account of pricing of outputs and inputs. For fertiliser industry, situation warrants a comprehensive exercise involving computation of domestic resource cost (DRC) of producing fertilisers on plant and product-specific basis, with an objective to identify plants that need retrofitting and revamping to come to acceptable norms of efficiency. On consumers' front, there is urgent need to reorient the public distribution system (PDS) making it more sharply focused towards vulnerable sections of society either by linking it with 'food for work' type of programmes or by income targeting or by distributing coarser varieties of wheat and rice and coarse cereals, wherever possible.||Ashok Gulati,G.

The debate has been mostly centred around the proponents of two theoretical standpoints-the Neoclassical and the Marxian. We look at the debate from two other theoretical frameworks-the Modern Austrian and the Post-Keynesian. We find that these two frameworks provide perspectives on the nature and role of the market process and the role of the government that is quite different from the Neoclassical and Marxian viewpoints. The Modern Austrians and Post-Keynesians view the market as an open-ended evolutionary process and thus provide a rationale for 'free markets' that go beyond the Neoclassical focus on 'efficient resource allocation' and 'pareto optimality'. The Austrians stress the role of the price system in achieving 'the economy of knowledge' and the importance of competition and the market process as a discovery procedure. The Post-Keynesians highlight the creativity and spontaneity exhibited by market participants in the presence of fundamental uncertainty of the future. The Post-Keynesians also envisage a role for the government which is different from the Neoclassical and Marxian views. Unlike the Neoclassicals, the Post-Keynesians call for an activist government. Unlike the Marxians, the Post-Keynesians argue for non-intervention by the state in the capitalist production process.||Kunal Sen,Rajendra Vaidya

The final classification of districts for the aggregate level of development was obtained using Wald's criterion. In the final classification, 11 districts were identified as being highly developed, while three districts were considered as belonging to the middle level of development. The remaining 15 districts were classified as underdeveloped. An examination of the regional profile indicates that all the districts of western Maharashtra with the exception of Dhule, were classified as belonging to medium and high levels of development. In sharp contrast, all the districts in Marathwada, except Aurangabad, and six out of nine districts in Vidarbha were classified as belonging to the category of underdeveloped districts. The persistence of wide disparities in the development of various regions in Maharashtra despite a quarter century of planned economic development is disconcerting and points to the need for urgent remedial measures.||K.

04/7/1992- ||special articles||4398588||The Debt-Energy Nexus: A Case Study of India||This study attempts to unravel the energy-debt nexus by linking India's energy imports to the growth of its external debt. The intention is to bring out, firstly, the extent to which India's debt problem could have been avoided with a different strategy of energy use in the 80s and, secondly, what changes in energy consumption are needed now to prevent a further build up of debt. The study considers the effect on India's imports of four important shifts in a strategy that would have reduced oil consumption and could have been implemented between 1977-78 and 1989-90: (i) a shift in a long-haul freight movement from road to rail, (ii) a shift from kerosene to liquefied petroleum gas for cooking, (iii) the electrification of unelectrified households, and (iv) the replacement of diesel irrigation pumpsets with electric pumpsets. Further, just as there are possibilities for the reduction of oil imports, there are also opportunities for reducing imports of energy sources and equipment for the generation of electricity. These opportunities arise through greater efficiency in the use of electricity. While energy strategies of the kind discussed here do require large investments, for a decision on whether or not the potential savings in oil consumption are worthwhile, the costs of these investments will have to be estimated and weighed against the benefits. It is crucial to develop a least-cost strategy in which all exports-increasing and imports-reducing measures are ranked according to the investments required to effect a unit increase in exports and/or a unit decrease in imports. These should be included serially in a package according to increasing unit cost until the desired reduction in the trade deficit is achieved. Without such a rational approach the government cannot avoid being ad hoc and arbitrary.||C. Rammanohar Reddy,Antonette D'Sa,Amulya K. N. Reddy

Its main findings are: (a) if our objective is to achieve diversified high growth in the economy, the agri-based manufacturing sectors may be taken up for intensive export-promotion measures considering their linkages and DI effects; (b) the degree of export orientation of a sector varies inversely with the linkages of the sector with the rest of the economy; and (c) the import intensity of export-oriented sectors is higher than that of other sectors. There is, thus, an urgent need to integrate export promotion measures in our overall development strategy.||Ravindra H. Dholakia,Bakul H. Dholakia,Ganesh Kumar

03/10/1992- ||special articles||4398971||Dangers of Environmental Extremism: Analysis of Debate over India's Social Forestry Programme||The recent growth in concern for the environmental problems of developing countries is a welcome development. However, the emotional commitment of environmentalists to protecting the environment has not been matched by their understanding of the complexities of the issues involved. An example of this is the way in which they greatly exaggerated the detrimental effects of India's social forestry programme, while ignoring its positive aspects. All too often, in movements for social change, concern over issues degenerates into rigid ideological beliefs. In this paper it is argued that environmentalists have fallen into the same trap-bringing into question their ability to constructively intervene in the development debate.||Michael Burgess

This identification is based on three premises about the role of land reforms and common lands in the emerging development strategy. First, they have to promote integration of growth policies with poverty alleviation programmes. Second, at the ground level, land reforms and improved access to common lands need to be part of packages of measures specifically designed to meet the requirement of different sub-groups of rural labourers and poor. Third, the ultimate goal of land reforms and other structural reforms is to promote the emergence of a viable and modernised peasantry consisting of small farmers and providing as much room as possible for the landless to enter the peasant sector or other self-employment sectors developing in the wake of a growing and technologically resilient agriculture.||V.

The study indicates that settled (terrace) cultivation is not as remunerative as shifting cultivation. The paper argues that the strategy for hill area development in India which has hitherto focused on the narrow issue of shifting (jhum) versus settled cultivation should shift its emphasis to the larger and more relevant issue of diversification of economic activities in the hill regions, which holds the key to the future and economic prosperity of hill and tribal regions.||K.

Tracing the origin of the 'deshmukhs' as local chiefs the paper discusses the extension of their power through a combination of landlordism, obstruction of free market in land and labour, the limited and controlled incorporation of intermediate classes into the power hierarchy, physical coercion and the enforcement of ritual and symbolic practices that reinforced the 'servility' of the lower castes and the 'authority' of the superior castes.

That some groups will derive more benefits than others is to be expected, as is shown by historical experience.

More specifically this study deals with how women's employment varies within large, small-scale and artisanal forms of production and the implications this has for women's bargaining power within the household.||Isa Baud
07/3/1992-14/3/1992||special articles||4397697||Financial Programming for Stabilisation: Some Notes on IMF Model||The IMF model of financial programming for stabilisation is based upon the monetary approach to the balance of payments. The model is incomplete as it does not combine a structure of general equilibrium with the fundamental equation of the monetary approach. In this paper a Keynesian theory of income determination is grafted onto the monetary approach, and the import inducing effect of direct foreign investment is recognised. It follows that the basic theorem of the monetary approach may get refuted under certain values of the parameters of the complete model. Econometric tests with Indian data reveal that it is quite possible for the IMF strategy to turn counterproductive. There are two parts to the policy model. Empirical evidence indicates the existence of a demand function for money, which is only one part. For the other part there are several alternative structures of general equilibrium. Hence the route to stabilisation is not unique. The IMF need not commit itself to a single model. Selection of the optimal model itself is the primary task before the action parameters and performance criteria can be meaningfully derived.||Ranjit Sau

In spite of the enduring nature of the classical agrarian exports such as sugar, tea, rubber and so on, the genesis of new agricultural enclaves distinguished by technological packaging, non-equity forms of control over production and the relative homogenisation of agro-technologies suggests a new social basis for the 'old' international division of labour and an aggressive industrialisation of peasant agriculture. This essay argues that the rural sector in the periphery is less a terrain of independent peasant production and commodity circulation through trade-or indeed of state or direct foreign investment in estate production-than a crucible in which innovative forms of social integration and agrarian corporatism link growers to state and private capital is forged.||Michael Watts

At the micro level, there are also several measures of good government, these include: growth and efficiency of public spending, quantification of output and performance of government, the extent of structural change in the civil service, devolution of government's responsibility to decentralised executive agencies, reforms in public enterprise and removal of areas of government failure, improved effectiveness of governments to manage poverty alleviation and other social sector programmes like education and health which provide useful tools of measuring good government. Areas of government should be reduced when it is too much and the failures too many. Similarly the areas of government should be extended when too little. In the developing countries, governments have yet to provide the cutting edge of a nation's competitive advantage as they do in many developed countries like France and Italy. The experience of the UK during the Thatcher years also provides some useful lessons.||Prahlad K. Basu

Given the long-term strategy of the BJP to capture power at the centre, the Ramjanmabhoomi campaign alone was insufficient: though it could demonstrate that Hindu sentiments had not been 'respected' by the state, it could not establish that Hindus were physically endangered. Therefore while the campaign organised Hindu consciousness and 'ideological' needs around a central symbol and a projected act of violence, the accompanying riots tried to orchestrate the need for 'protecting' and 'preserving' Hindu interests against the projected threat from Muslims.||Uma Chakravarti,Prem Chowdhury,Pradip Dutta,Zoya Hasan,Kumkum Sangari,Tanika Sarkar

This hinders attempts to examine these links and pose questions not only about changes in people's degree of wealth or poverty, employment or education but also about the nature of their intimate life arrangements and support networks. This article discusses one example of state influence on marriage, family and gender relations as well as the position of the more vulnerable family members vis-a-vis those who gained in power within their kin-networks. The example is that of the Sinhalese in Sri Lanka during British colonial rule (1795-1947).||Carla Risseeuw

Though diversely damaging in its consequences the crisis takes nothing away from the historic significance of the world's first socialist revolution or from the achievements of 'historical communism' as it is being described in certain epitaph-like pronouncements these days. Without historical communism the world would have been a far more inhuman and hopeless place. Beyond its historically specific achievements is a somewhat intangible aspect of the social reality today, a general illumination that bathes all the failed or successful particularities of our age. The living presence of 'historical communism' is manifest in the enhanced awareness of humankind concerning issues of human dignity, of justice and injustice, of equality, oppression and exploitation, in the voice and hope the poor and oppressed have come to acquire in our times, in the quality and spread of their struggles for a better life and in their confidence, despite all the retreats and reverses, that they can fight and win their emancipation.||Randhir Singh

It is seen that while the long run performance of the rural institutional finance system has been good short run growth rates display a desperate performance. Moreover, this system has performed better in deposit mobilisation than in financing agricultural output and investment. Its performance on the functional structure of loans and loan recovery leaves much to be desired. Despite this, the RFIs are viable and have not suffered from scale diseconomies in their transaction costs.

Properly viewed, such decentralisation of the public sector in regard to both plan and non-plan activities is both necessary and desirable. But the truth is that there is neither an adequate transfer of financial resources, nor decentralisation of plan decisions in Manmohan Singh's budget; and this ought to cause concern not just to the states but to many others as well.||K S Krishnaswamy

In the process, it raises certain basic theoretical issues and argues against using high rates of discount when the cash flows are at constant prices. The viability is proved through all the three criteria-NPV, BCRs and IRRs, and on the basis of direct benefits only. Inclusion of indirect benefits would have shown the economic viability to be even higher. What is more, social forestry pays for itself and it is no charity to rural areas. The projects can be financially viable even after meeting the bio-mass needs of the local poor. The paper makes its biases and assumptions quite explicit. The direction of biases is to test the viability as rigorously as is reasonable.||M. V. Nadkarni,K. N. Ninan,Syed Ajmal Pasha

This paper discusses the experiences of Bangladesh with groundwater irrigation, agricultural growth and poverty alleviation and argues that the apparently largely beneficial development of groundwater in the country has had little to do with deliberate policies for managing groundwater.

As the market system has expanded crafts have tended to decline today in India. However, women continue to be engaged in them to a greater extent than men. This article is based on a field study designed to identify the consequences for women and for the family of the particular mesh of pre-capitalist and capitalist production now prevalent. Two villages in which the canebamboo craft is carried on are compared and significant differences in the organisation of work between the two are brought out. Customary caste relationships and family kinship structures continue to shape women's work and women's entitlements. Insofar as family strategy selectively projects men into the wider market economy, the net result fits in with the market's preference for male labour (except in special cases where women's labour is cheaper). Men seek alternatives to decreasingly remunerative craft work through wage labour either within or outside the village. Where migration is not feasible men may switch to commodity production of saleable craft items as distinguished from production within customary rewards. Women of the same families tend to remain bound by traditional patterns of rights and obligations.||Maithreyi Krishnaraj

Depletion tends to disproportionately affect the poor by further limiting their access to the resource. Unfortunately, the same can be said for most management alternatives other than supply creation. Inherent tensions exist between equitable access to groundwater resources and management options to ensure sustainable use. New institutional approaches-similar, for example, to those used in joint forest management-are required which can incorporate both equity and sustainability goals. This paper reviews emerging groundwater degradation issues in Gujarat and their implications for equitable resource access. Current management practices and proposed alternatives are examined from both resource sustainability and access equity perspectives. Innovative institutional approaches based on user-groups are discussed and their viability is examined through lessons from the management of other common pool resources. It is argued that the dual goals of sustainability and equity may be best served through management institutions based on local user groups.||Marcus H. Moench

The one theme unifying these endeavours was the aspiration towards creating a community of equals. It will be argued here that the idea of community represents an aspiration and not an achieved entity; communities are always in the process of formation without reaching realisation. There can only be conjunctural creations of community when a temporary balance is achieved between diverse individual initiatives. This paper looks at the creation of one such conjunctural community when the aims of communist political activity, the aspirations for land and equality among low caste agricultural labourers and the need for landowners to get cultivators for their lands in the context of food shortage following the second world war all came together.||Dilip M.

This, in turn, could provide relative advantage in exports. But the Indian experience over the last four decades shows that the possible welfare improving outcomes of oligopoly or monopoly domestic market structure in terms of scale economies and also technological innovation did not take place. At the present juncture, it might be more beneficial to let a large number of firms to compete for the domestic market, even at the cost of possible scale economies at the initial stage. Later on, if the market turns into a natural monopoly, through internal scale economies, that might be socially more beneficial than protecting the firms through artificial entry barriers.||Murali Patibandla

Simple regression analysis confirms that during the period 1971-90 the depreciation of the rupee had no favourable effect on the dollar value and volume of exports and no contractionary effect on the value and volume of imports. Hence it had no influence on the balance of trade. Over the period of 20 years since 1971 when the rupee started to depreciate under the 'managed' float system, the dollar values (at current and constant prices) of exports grew rapidly but India's share in world exports remained at a meagre level. As the dollar values of imports rose at a higher speed, the trade and payments deficits mounted. In the 80s, the process of depreciation of the rupee accelerated. But there was no sign of acceleration in the growth of exports valued in dollar. However, the growth in the trade deficit decelerated due to a deceleration in the growth of imports valued in dollars which in turn was due to a deceleration in the growth of crude oil imports. The payment deficit mounted partly due to a deceleration in the growth of private foreign remittances which was a fall-out of declining oil prices and the consequent declining prosperity of the Gulf.||Prabirjit Sarkar
29/2/1992- ||review of industry and management, february 1992||4397656||Protection, Growth and Competitiveness: Study of Indian Capital Goods Industry||The new trade theory of Helpman, Krugman and others, taken together with earlier literature on learning effects, factor intensity reversals, etc, imply that general results about the effects of protection could be misleading. Under conditions of increasing returns, or market imperfections, protection could well serve as a strategic export promoting device. The costs and benefits of protection, therefore, need to be evaluated from a dynamic comparative advantage perspective for individual cases: specific products in specific countries. Taking the case of capital goods, which lay at the core of the Nehru-Mahalanobis strategy of state-dominated industrialisation under protection in India, this paper first measures the dynamic benefits of protection, in the form of extra growth on account of import substitution. It then goes on to demonstrate that, despite the higher scales of production achieved on account of extra growth over many years, the capital goods industry has failed to become internationally competitive. In the process, the paper also argues that conventional efficiency measures like the domestic resource cost are inappropriate for analysing competitiveness. An alternative measure is then used, which decomposes domestic-international price differences into that component attributable to the inefficiency of capital goods firms themselves and that which is attributable to distortions elsewhere in the system.||Sudipto Mundle,Hiranya Mukhopadhyay

Examining definitions of 'India' and 'Indianness' by the institutionalised Indo-Anglian literary critical tradition the paper contends that the 'India' produced by the dominant literary critical tradition is not an 'authentic', politically neutral entity, but one based on a systematic suppression of the identities of various underprivileged sections. The contention is sought to be established through a re-reading of representative essays by major Indo-Anglian literary critics with a view to establishing the underlying ideological biases.||Ajanta Sircar
08/2/1992- ||special articles||4397565||Terrorism, State Terrorism and Democratic Rights||In a class-divided, exploitative society like ours, on all important issues in philosophy as in real life, neutrality is an illusion. And so it is with terrorism and democratic rights. It is our explanation or understanding of social reality, which indicates the prescription as well. An explanation thus always has a 'value slope'. And if it is this 'value slope' which is decisive in suggesting the purposeful human intervention on our part, then obviously it matters how we generally go about explaining and/or understanding things. In other words we need to be self-consciously aware of our philosophical or methodological orientation in coming to terms with the reality around us. How does the dominant mode of thinking deal with the issues of terrorism, state terrorism and democratic rights? And how do we need to think about them?||Randhir Singh

This essay examines the concept of 'military revolution' and tests its validity with respect to certain aspects of early modern Indian military history. It is argued here that the role of military technology in the military-naval history of the western coast of India, specifically in the 18th century, requires reappraisal. The author contends that the role of military technology in history can be fruitfully defined only in relation to interactive factors like geography and politics conditioning the environment of early modern warfare.||Anirudh Deshpande

True, the American system continues to process claims efficiently into policy outputs but analysis of voter turnout, the information level of the electorate, poverty levels, racial discrimination, corrupt practices and the functioning of interest groups suggests that considerable sections of American citizens may become progressively disaffected.||Khalid B.

The orthodoxy claims to be based on the experience of a large number of developing countries in pursuing similar adjustment programmes over the last two decades, and on the conviction that these experiences carry some common lessons for most other developing countries. On the other hand, critics question the orthodox analysis on various counts, and believe that unique features of the Indian economy render invalid most of its 'lessons'. The author briefly reviews, in Section II of this paper, the reasoning employed for and against the typical structural adjustment programme. Section III examines some macroeconomic data pertaining to the Indian economic crisis, with a view to identifying the underlying factors. Section IV then goes on to appraise some of the broad policy initiatives chosen by the government since the summer of 1991.||Dilip Mookherjee

Faced with the problem of identifying some sort of agency that might undo the centuries-old link between the narratives of high humanism and the colonial project Said posits the most ordinary and familiar values of humanist liberalism-humanism-as-ideality is invoked even as humanism-as-history is unequivocally rejected. This ambivalence is further complicated by the impossible reconciliation which Said tries to achieve between that humanism and Foucaultian discourse theory which is inseparable from Nietzschean anti-humanism and the currently dominant anti-realist theories of representation. This essay argued from a Marxist perspective offers a critique of Said on fundamental issues of theory and history.||Aijaz Ahmad

Regression analysis with versions of that model is performed to further examine specific issues and evaluate hypotheses in a policy-relevant framework. Four broad sets of questions are selected for discussion here: (1) How strong are the linkages of the rural non-farm sector with agriculture and what is their predominant nature? (2) What is the character of the rural labour supply insofar as it relates to employment in this sector? (3) What are the salient demand-side features of the structure of rural non-farm industry? and (4) What forms of governmental interventions, if any, have had an impact on the size and share of this sector in the rural economy? Tentative policy implications of the exercises suggest the stimulating impact on this sector of a strong agricultural development strategy, promotion of rural non-agricultural enterprise in a manner which strengthens comparative advantage without creating inefficient locational distortions, and of public capital expenditures on road and irrigation projects.||Vibhooti Shukla

Although mass hunger and epidemics have thus far been avoided, economic hardship has become widely shared, especially among vulnerable children, women, the elderly, and other disadvantaged groups. Critical commodities needed by the health care and food systems are rapidly becoming depleted and under severe fiscal constraints. To prevent the potential collapse of a basically sound health care system, the immediate provision of critical vaccines, drugs, and supplies, accompanied by appropriate technical assistance, is urgently needed. Also important are maintaining 'safety nets' for vulnerable groups so that they retain purchasing power to meet vital needs. Nutritional interventions especially in the food-deficit republics should be targeted at high risk children and women, accompanied by the promotion of breast-feeding.||Lincoln C. Chen,Jon E.

This paper attempts to examine the researches conducted in the field of education in India from the theoretical perspectives of feminism. Analysis of such research studies reveals the absence of clear research perspectives in examining issues relating to women's education.

She typically receives very little support from persons other than her children, and even when she lives with one or several of her adult sons she remains highly vulnerable to neglect. Further, her ability to engage in income-earning activities of her own is severely restricted, partly due to various patriarchal norms such as patrilineal inheritance and the division of labour by gender. The consequences of this social and economic marginalisation are manifest in poor health and high mortality levels. This paper explores aspects of the lives of widows in north India that have a strong bearing on their health and well-being, with special attention to the issue of social support.||Marty Chen,Jean Dreze

The TRIPS negotiations have focused exclusively on the monopoly rights of patentees from developed countries and, in doing so, all the issues raised in the debates on the 'Code of Conduct for Transfer of Technology' and the 'Code of Conduct for Multinational Corporations' have been conveniently forgotten.

Contrary to the nervous half-promises of the prime minister and the finance minister, care would not be taken not to reduce the net deployment of labour. The number of public sector units to be closed down is still indeterminate, but retrenchment of workers will be across-the-board and a minimum of 5,00,000 are to lose their jobs.||A. M.

The latter appears to be in a process of dramatic breakdown while the former continues to be on the ascendant, asserting its relevance and reinforcing its determination to exist in a unipolar world by unambiguously conveying the message that it has not outlived its purpose. This paper examines three separate yet interrelated issues-the factors that impelled the grand transformation in eastern Europe, the nature of the problems involved in effecting the transition to a democratic regime based in the market and the theoretical issues they raise in the analysis of comparative economic systems.||Ramnath Narayanswamy

In this context, the Parliamentary Papers on Widow Immolation, 1821-30 are of immense historical value not only for the evidence of the colonial denigration of Hindu women and religion, but for the tensions and contradictions which they reveal, the unravelling of which has significance for the understanding of attitudes today.||Vasudha Dalmia-Lüderitz

Are the elements of the structural reform programme correctly addressed to meeting the real problems of the economy? Was the timing of the stabilisation and structural reform policies appropriate? Most important, should these policies be seen to be not working, what are the choices still open to the country?||Arun Ghosh

17/10/1992- ||special articles||4399029||Falling Agricultural Investment and Its Consequences||Neglect of agriculture, an important sector of the Indian economy, is likely to have an adverse impact on the country. Such a neglect has been observed as a fall in agricultural investment during the 80s. Simulations using a computable general equilibrium model help in assessing the adverse impact of the fall in total agricultural investment on agriculture in particular and the economy in general. Though shifting investment resources away from agriculture to non-agriculture may result in a faster growth in total gross domestic product, the growth across sectors is likely to be uneven, with non-agriculture likely to show a far higher growth than agriculture. However, slowing down agricultural growth would lead to growing income inequality in rural areas. If the present trends of investment policy are continued large-scale cereal imports may become necessary and also despite such imports prices would go up substantially. Price increases of foodgrains are known to hit the poor most.||A. Ganesh Kumar

Collectively, the former's debt is 104 per cent of their GNP and 490 per cent of their annual exports. This paper attempts to identify and analyse the problems of mounting external debt and servicing burden of these sub-Saharan African countries. Also, inter alia, debt initiatives of the World Bank and the IMF have been critically examined. It is argued that orthodox 'neo-classical' or the 'monetarist' approach of the Bank and Fund supported adjustment programmes have achieved little by laying stress on 'market-oriented reform'. In fact, as such programmes are implemented in the midst of macro-economic instability, they are likely to aggravate the problem and make it more difficult for the government to finance its deficit in a non-inflationary manner.||Nirupam Bajpai

In fact, the moral of the balanced budget debate in the US, if there be any, is simply that procedural reform is no substitute for the political will of the people and their leaders.||Amaresh Bagchi

The savings behaviour of the economy is then examined and related to these criteria. It is shown that while a short-run dynamic demand constraint held, a longer-run supply or resource constraint dampened investment demand in the late 60s and 70s. High public sector investment from the late 70s helped maintain favourable growth dynamics that has led to financial deepening and increased flow of resources to productive sectors, helping to relax the longer run resource constraint. This, in turn, may make possible innovative fiscal reform, including sale of public sector enterprises, to maintain high new public sector investment, until growth can become self-sustaining.||Ashima Goyal

In Tamil society in particular, we can trace a long history of women owning, controlling and disposing of personal property, while in more recent times, there is a distinctive tradition of land passing from mother to daughter in a female line of descent.

This crucial hegemonic move was characterised by a transition away from mere mercantile or despotic to a strategic and 'benevolent' articulation of power via knowledge. The intellectual disciplines that arose in the new colonial space were specialised ones in which the human subject was collapsed into swarming detail. Later, the subject was acted upon by the new disciplines to acquire the rules of the details most naturally and thus to make them both docile and functional. From these disciplines evolved a diffuse, highly elastic, apparatus of cultural and ideological formation in India. The enunciative strengths of such an apparatus have only gained new dimensions in the post-colonial phase, as the anxiety to wed culture with the concept of a nation has grown enormously in recent times.||Mukesh Srivastava

The message was driven home to the top brass of the 'nationalised' banks and public financial institutions. The economy might be doing badly, the rate of industrial growth might actually be negative, but the miracle-makers were at work and deserved the solidest support from the state. One must not ask whether the funds with which they played their tricks in the market were being provided against certain junk papers. To inconvenience the bulls was akin to inconveniencing the nation.||A. M.

Major exporters of agricultural commodities, like the US and the European Community subsidise their farm sectors by 26 and 36 per cent of their value, respectively. Their exports distort the world commodity prices, transmitting wrong signals to cultivators in other countries. It leads to huge efficiency losses in the use of global resources, which must be checked. The Uruguay round makes the first serious attempt in this direction by attempting to bring agriculture under GATT, and proposing a gradual reduction in subsidies as delineated in the Dunkel Draft. If Dunkel Draft has its way, world agriculture will gradually move to the developing countries and the Cairns Group. Indian agriculture is likely to prosper, inviting more resources purely on efficiency grounds.||Ashok Gulati,A. N. Sharma

In the bad old days, creditors sent gun boats and marines to collect bad debts, but frequently they had to cut their losses. Today the system is more civilised, but also more creditor-friendly.

07/3/1992-14/3/1992||special articles||4397696||Bad Advice||The economist's traditional model is that of a soundless economy. If individuals suddenly lost their ability to speak, nothing would happen to this economy because their ability to speak was never a part of its assumptions. Yet in reality speech matters, not only in itself but because it influences the world of action. This paper shows that the link between the world of speech and the world of action is as yet ill-understood and its understanding is important for the social sciences. It argues, for instance, that the advice of economists has had insufficient impact on actual policy not so much because of the inadequacy of the contents of the advice as because of our ignorance of how to give advice. Some of the existing work on speech and action-for instance, that on 'cheap talk' games-is critically examined and a preliminary outline of a theory of policy advice is sketched.||Kaushik Basu

Today the struggle is in a crucial phase of its development and has a bearing on the process of organisation of the unorganised sector nationwide and on the role of independent unions in the political process.||Gabriele Dietrich

The programme was based on the standard IMF 'menu' of macro-economic stabilisation followed by the implementation of economic reforms consisting of liberalisation of trade, privatisation of agricultural land, liberalisation of the banking system, privatisation of state enterprises, etc. The G-7 and the international financial community have, however, judged the programme as a 'successful' landmark in debt management and macro-economic adjustment.

Some Evidence from Rajasthan||The dominant view contends that vast tracts of common grazing land are wastelands to be greened in the wake of the environmental crisis confronting the country's arid and semi-arid zones. Clearly there can be no definition of wasteland other than that which draws attention to its defining feature of uselessness. What is to be investigated then, is whether this land and its produce, if any, has a use value at all. This article, based on a study in the Sikar district of Rajasthan, juxtaposes the state's view (incorporating the scientists' definition) of wastelands to the villagers' perception of the commons which draws its characteristics and validity from the shared context of local inhabitants.||Rita Brara

Economic Reform in an Uncertain World||Both supporters and critics of the liberalisation policies of the eighties agree that these occurred against a background of large macro-economic imbalances: a huge foreign debt liability, a barely sustainable balance of payments situation and growing fiscal deficits Although the threat of a default on loan obligations has now receded, short-term breathing space is still being provided by disbursements from the IMF on fulfilling various performance criteria laid down by the Fund. Against this background, the impact of the budget for 1992-93 can be judged on the basis of the following criteria: (I) To what extent does it attempt to redress the macro-economic imbalances in the economy? (2) What does it do to further the growth of the economy? (3) Is the strategy it proposes likely to succeed in view of the constraints faced?||B Gopalakrishna Kumar

The formal recognition of independent states in what was Yugoslavia ensures the permanent confrontation of regimes defined only by their opposition to each other.||Robert M. Hayden

Results based on our analysis indicate that most of the industries that we consider are demand constrained, although the estimated slack/shortage has not been uniform over the years. It is, however, possible that the lack of demand could have been generated by some supply constraints such as inadequate industrial infrastructure.||P. V. Srinivasan

The results show that if a choice has to be made among these policy instruments, investment on irrigation has the potential of tackling two persistent problems of the Indian economy-vulnerability of agriculture to weather conditions and lack of purchasing power of a large section of the populace to buy food-by way of reducing dependence on the rain god and improving income distribution.||D.

A review of the energy policy planning exercises done in India by the government so far shows that most of the studies have used the traditional regression models or the end-use models, which were used by energy policy-makers in developed countries, for projecting energy demand; after estimating demand, the various supply options have been examined to meet this estimated demand. But, the integration of the supply and demand sides was done only recently in order to find out the minimum cost at which a certain projected growth rate of the economy can be sustained. An integrated approach helps to identify steps which connect the appropriate primary energy forms with the required useful energy so as to increase the efficiency of the entire energy system.||Neelanjana Mitra
