The mass of Indian people do not have to necessarily wait for an indefinite future for the hump of economic growth to be crossed for schooling, house sites, primary health care, food at fair prices and so on. The contemporary crisis that Kerala faces, nevertheless, underlines the limitations of what can be achieved within the present system. It also shows that in the absence of economic growth it is difficult to sustain, much less expand, welfare gains. The challenge is to enlist the increased political consciousness and organised strength of the people as an instrument to accelerate economic growth in a democratic fashion. Correctives to the various distortions in the social and cultural areas are also required. From the dialogue at last year's International Congress on Kerala Studies certain broad perspectives emerged, though some important questions were indeed left open and unconcluded.||Thomas Isaac T.

The new policy regime is likely to intensify and accelerate the process of technological polarisation between the large and small scale sectors, and high tech imports will impede the design and innovation capability of in-house R and D units. An educated and skilled workforce is essential to economic development, and for this a new public policy for a radical transformation of the education system is needed.||M. R. Bhagavan

Comparative efficiency parameters are estimated for the period 1973-74 to 1988-89 using data generated by the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) which relate to the organised sector of manufacturing industry. The results establish that, in aggregate, enterprises owned by the central government and the governments of various states in India, while accounting for a major chunk of capital investment, are systematically only two-thirds as efficient as private sector enterprises, while joint sector enterprises are also less efficient than those in the private sector. Results of the data analyses reveal that the assumptions of economic theory, positing higher efficiency levels for the private sector, cannot be disproved in the Indian context, and the results also contradict extant evidence which have found no performance differences between government-owned and private firms in India. The paper also discusses certain features unique to the political environment of India as a result of which the noted efficiency differences arise. However, the data also show that reforms that have been put in place in the 1980s towards improving government-owned enterprise performance have had a systematic and significant impact in leading to inter-temporal efficiency gains, particularly in enterprises owned by the central government.||Sumit K.

This implies that what needs to be considered is the revenue that is generated under alternative systems and the structure of absolute and relative prices associated with each. This paper examines the central issue of revenue neutrality and relative prices under alternative tax systems and clarifies the phenomenon of cascading. In analysing the issue of cascading, the authors distinguish between a pure exchange or trade model and model of production with produced inputs subject to taxation.||K. Sundaram,V. Pandit,B.

It is argued that while such a framework should work with macro-economic categories of aggregate demand and supply, it should incorporate structural features of the Indian economy, focus on the decisions of the firm over the medium run, and be capable of analysing the affects on growth, of macro-economic policies. Conclusions follow that inflation is best managed by a set of policies that stimulate demand as well as supply. The possibility of multiple equilibria implies that a set of policies that act in concord to push the economy on a high growth path can lead to a situation where every group benefits. As the price of food is the nominal standard for the Indian economy, policies that effect the former are particularly important.||Ashima Goyal

The Germans, the Spanish, the Dutch, the French, the Portuguese, and the British, whose domains in Asia were once greatest of them all, withdrew or were forcefully evicted. But Britain preserved its power undiminished over the tiny but populous patch of China named Hong Kong, and thus the reversion of Hong Kong to China in 1997 will close an epilogue to the age of Europe's Asian dominance. Through the first half of the century Britain lived with the thought of the 1997 expiry of the lease which legitimises its rule over Hong Kong as a healthy young person accommodates the idea of mortality. After coming to accept that the return of Hong Kong to China was ineluctable, Britain succeeded in negotiating with Beijing what promised to be a co-operative and cordial transfer of power. How that agreement was achieved and how the achievement came to be undone is the subject of this paper.||Neville Maxwell

The indiscriminate opening of the economies of the South has created the risk of intensifying the process of the dualisation of the economy and society. The countries in transitions face the three-fold challenge of stabilising their economies, creating institutions for the functioning of market-led economies and of undertaking a thorough restructuring of their productive capacities. The most important challenge in the coming years will be that of the renewal of development thinking and a search for new development paradise.||Ignacy Sachs

Surprisingly, these aspects, which impinge directly and crucially on women's legal and economic status, have received little attention so far from either researchers or activists. This paper attempts to fill some of this gap. Section I of the paper briefly outlines the process of formulation of Hindu inheritance laws today and their broad features. Section II identifies the major gender inequalities which remain, focusing especially on Hindu women's right in agricultural land. It also highlights the gender discriminatory aspects of ceiling laws. Section III outlines the laws governing Christians and Parsis, including recent changes resulting from Christian women in Kerala challenging gender inequalities in their laws. Section IV traces aspects of contemporary Islamic law, the process of its formulation, and the persisting inequalities especially in women's rights in agricultural land. Summary comments are provided in the concluding Section V.||Bina Agarwal

Pioneering Work Revisited||Agricultural insurance, especially crop insurance, exists in many countries as an institutional response to agricultural risk. The issue of whether crop insurance can work has been intensely debated during the last decade. In view of the problems faced by crop insurance schemes in some countries, a suggestion for rainfall insurance has received attention in the recent literature. Interestingly, J S Chakravarti designed, as early as in 1920, a scheme of agricultural insurance based on rainfall for India. It is a pioneering work on agricultural insurance. Surprisingly, this piece of work, which is probably one of the earliest monographs on the subject, does not appear to have been accounted for in the analytical literature on agricultural insurance.||Pramod K.

The inequality cannot be corrected through exercises in tokenism and populist 'give away' programmes but only through creation of and support to income generating skills among the poor. An attempt is made in this paper to examine the current status of different states with respect to their levels of Nutritional Status and 'Social Development', using data derived from NNMB and NFHS. Attention is drawn to the problems posed by ongoing urbanisation and the emergence of an expanding middle class. The prospect of the country having to bear a double burden of problems - of urbanisation at one end of the income spectrum and of undernutrition at the other end - is examined.||C. Gopalan

Asset distribution in India is very skewed. Using the efficiency wage theory this paper proves with simple geometry that a competitive equilibrium in an economy with highly unequal asset holding will entail involuntary unemployment of the assetless poor. Although both are competitive, the equilibrium here sharply differs from that of an Arrow-Debreu economy which presumes sufficient assets for all agents. East Asia had satisfied the Arrow-Debreu presumption through radical land reforms before the economic 'miracle' was initiated. South Asia and Latin America fare miserably in this respect. If land reform is not feasible, capital reform can serve the same purpose. A scheme of capital reform has been suggested here for India. It transpires that the consumption dynamics in India may aggravate the problem of unemployment of the poor.||Ranjit Sau

Debates being actively promoted today twist the very premises and values on which the movement had been based.

The Haryana experience suggests that sustained growth in agriculture plus a deliberate policy of income and occupational diversification is the most effective cure for poverty. While the strategy of investment in rural infrastructure, agriculture and industrial development appears to have worked, Haryana still has a poor record in regard to quality of life indicators such as health, mortality, and sex ratio.||Sheila Bhalla

However, the danger of focusing only on these specific projects is that attention may be diverted from the more fundamental task of framing a new policy for the power sector. What are the dimensions of the crisis facing the power sector and how can it be resolved? Confusion on these basic issues has led to many reactions to the Enron fiasco which are erroneous and misleading.||Jayati Ghosh,Abhijit Sen,C. P. Chandrasekhar

This paper raises questions about how the political present theorises itself, focusing on three concepts - history, sovereignty and the subject.

The Japanese regime, and its application by multinationals worldwide, has already heralded a new phase in the process of capital accumulation. The serial production of mass commodities is not abolished in a Japanised structure; on the contrary. The Japanese automobile and electronic companies - like just their American competitors - aim at standardised manufacture of mass products on the largest possible scale. But in order to reach this goal, the internal, hierarchical relations within enterprises, and external relations, are being profoundly restructured. For the trade union movement of industrial workers, including in third world countries like Mexico, Brazil and India as well, Japanisation has far-reaching consequences.||Peter Custers

17/6/1995- ||commentary||4402872||Sardar Sarovar Project: Compensation Schemes for Severely Distressed Canal Affected People||The canal network for the Sardar Sarovar Project (SSP) requires greater investment than the dam, and will affect far more people than the reservoir. While a majority of canal affected people (CAP) lose only tiny strips of land on field borders, a substantial number lose significant amounts. At its extremity, a small number of severely distressed canal affected people (DCAP) become landless or marginal farmers or suffer intense deprivation in other ways. Proponents and opponents of the SSP have accepted the need to provide special compensation for the DCAP, but no uniform eligibility criterion exists. Various schemes have been suggested for compensating the DCAP. However, the actual policy in practice seems to be to pay compensation under the Land Acquisition Act, only for the amount of land acquired. The government of Gujarat does not even have a record of those handful of farmers who have lost all their land. Nor do the decision-makers have an understanding of even the most basic facts about the full impact of canal building. The main problem is a lack of political will.||Gautam Appa

Hence, the role of the state and the market, the former symbolised by various forms of intervention and the latter by neoclassical economics and pricing, has preoccupied analysts. Debates have raged over 'state failure' and 'market failure' with the search for new theoretical approaches. In this context, New Institutional Economics (NIE) focuses on analysing the conduct of rational individuals under various forms of market failure. Basically, a social dilemma emerges when radical individualism becomes inconsistent with social welfare such that the choices made by rational individuals yield outcomes that are socially undesirable [i e, net Pareto optimality], with market failures yielding social dilemmas. NIE professes that institutions provide the mechanisms to enable individuals to escape the tension between individual and social rationality created by the perverse incentives that produce the failure of markets. While NIE sets out to build on, modify and extend neoclassical theory, it functions firmly in the realm of scarcity and competition. An analysis of NIE for development demands a fuller understanding of the interaction between the state and development policies. This paper aims to highlight some of the key conceptual and empirical issues which impinge on NIE.||Sumit Roy

Using monthly data since 1980, our results indicate that exports, imports and the balance of trade are following a long-term trend which has been unaffected by the two doses of devaluation in 1991. This leads us to question the utility of devaluation as a corrective mechanism for achieving a desired trade balance. At the same time, indications are that devaluation would worsen the debt burden, ceteris paribus. Thus the BOP deficits are unsustainable, as they are accompanied neither by improved net export earnings, nor by easier external finance. There is also some indication of stagnation in industrial production and acceleration in inflation since 1991.||Ashwini Deshpande,Prabirjit Sarkar

It is found that the decline in the saving rate has predominantly originated in household physical saving, the main subcategory of saving which is common to both saving and investment estimates prepared by the CSO, Given that the persistent decline in household physical saving has occurred in a context where private corporate investment has exhibited strong growth and that there is no evidence of an intrinsic bias in the new policy regime against the unorganised sector, we suspect that the decline in the saving rate is a statistical artefact resulting from an underestimation of total gross domestic capital formation.||Premachandra Athukorala,Kunal Sen

This trend is not surprising for the 1970s, a period of rapid agricultural growth, but is perplexing for the latter part of the 1980s when growth had slackened. These trends point to the significance of public intervention for poverty alleviation, in particular the Rs 2 a kilo rice scheme, which is evaluated here. However, the most effective measure that could be taken to reduce poverty is land reform, without which other schemes cannot have much impact.||G. Parthasarathy

Rather, the disruption of the relationship between local societies and their natural resource bases has continued in the worldwide movement towards modernisation. Instead of contrasting this situation with a mythical golden age of equilibrium between society and nature, what is needed is a radical critique of capitalist expansionism, of which the colonisation of nature has been one of the major objectives.||Jacques Pouchepadass

The first is discussed within the ecclesiastical context of conversion and evangelisation and is crucial to the understanding of the inspiration and gradual evolution of missionary institutions. The second is framed by a more secular discussion and is important because of the pioneering role the missions had in bringing western education to India and the effect this had on Indian society. The author concludes by arguing for a socio-political analysis of and a contextualised theology of secular action for Christian education if the liberating potential of its ideals and purposes is to be realised.||Rudolf C.

The irrigation engineers who planned these projects showed a technological prejudice as they rarely sought alternative methods and scales of irrigation in each of these basins. This prejudice is of serious concern in a high rainfall area like Kerala, where the dam and canal-based system is 'naturally' costly and where there is a possibility of meeting the relatively small requirement of additional water through less expensive means. The objective of achieving self-sufficiency in rice and the policy of having major irrigation projects in all the basins seem to be based on the neglect of the specific agro-climatological and agro-ecological features of humid-tropic Kerala.||V.

An analysis of R and D expenditure in India shows that funding for technology in specific sectors is not in consonance with the size of domestic or global markets. The sectors which should be given priority - agriculture, industry, health and forestry - receive relatively less R and D funding. Thus India needs to restructure its technology priorities as well as make its R and D activities more market-oriented.||S. Chandrashekar

In order to fill a noticeable lacuna in women's health studies, information about mental illness in Indian women has been obtained from the primary data available from these studies. As gender has been used as a socio-demographic variable in all the studies, it was possible to cull out gender relevant data and re-analyse them from the gender perspective.

The official policies on foreign direct investment since 1991 are discussed and their implications are analysed, especially the response of TNCs and the impact on indigenous firms. The author attempts to probe whether TNCs are responding to the new economic policies by investing primarily for the export market or for the domestic market and examines the future prospects for export-oriented foreign investment.||Sudip Chaudhuri

It would, however, be unwise to be complacent. The ratio of direct tax collections to GDP in India still compares poorly with that in other developing countries. Rough calculations suggest that the 'tax gap' continues to be quite large and the personal income tax is able to capture only about 50 per cent of its potential. The Tax Reforms Committee had laid out a two-pronged strategy to improve the yield of income tax - widening the tax base combined with moderation in rates on the one hand and strengthening the administration on the other. Several measures have been taken to implement these recommendations, but much still remains to be done.||Aamresh Bagchi

However, their poor management resulted in erratic water supplies and eroded farmers' faith in the system. The government, therefore, decided to hand-over all the shallow tubewells constructed under the World Bank scheme to local panchayat samitis. The democratic setup of the panchayati raj system was fully involved in the entire process from the allotment of tubewells to management of them. The study reveals that the overall performance of the tubewells was encouraging with the beneficiaries paying water charges on regular basis. However, delay in energisation and lack of adequate power supply during the peak requirement season led to some underutilisation of tubewells.||D. S. K. Rao

While natural or technological factors such as floods, poor development of infrastructure and high population density play their part, the state's backwardness is related more to the inequitous and exploitative socio-economic structure, lack of political leadership and almost total collapse of the administrative and law and order machinery - to the point where it is said that in Bihar 'the state has withered away'. These conditions have created a milieu of non-development in which even large-scale poverty eradication programmes have had little impact. The only ray of hope is the increasing awareness and mobilisation of the rural poor, whose potential can be harnessed to improve the management of such schemes and to pressurise the state into making structural changes.||Alakh N.

Thus, any path charted out with reduced government intervention (assuming that policy failure is eliminated) may not only not lead the economy to the socially optimum point but not even to the First Best frontier. With policy failure and the economy in the Second Best environment, the First Best is unattainable by reducing government intervention. The economy may move to a more sub-optimal situation while the Second Best frontier contracts to a socially less desirable position. The principal problem facing the economy is not too much government intervention but failure of policy. The trend of the five budgets since 1991 illustrates the proposition that the economy is moving to a more sub-optimal position within the Second Best frontier with no stable path out of the trap.||Arun Kumar

In any case no real fiscal 'correction' has occurred. To cut the deficit and call this 'fiscal prudence' reveals an Orwellian imagination. This article examines the foundations of the macro-economic aspects of the recent policy initiatives.||Pulapre Balakrishnan

Agricultural Growth and Agrarian Change in West Bengal and Bangladesh||Drawing on papers presented in a workshop held in Calcutta in January 1995, this article reports on debates over the nature of the relationships between agrarian structure, agricultural growth and the state in West Bengal and Bangladesh. It scrutinises reports of rapid agricultural growth in West Bengal (and less spectacular but still significant agricultural growth in Bangladesh) since the early 1980s and expands the concept of structure to include structures of commerce, of bureaucracies, of exchange arrangements in land, water and labour, as well as changing ideologies of gender, caste and ethnicity. The local impact of the West Bengal Left Front government's agrarian reforms (including Panchayati Raj) are also analysed and trends in poverty in the two Bengals since 1980 are examined.||Ben Rogaly,Barbara Harriss-White,Sugata Bose

It challenges the assumptions on which positions that advocate legal pluralism and defend personal laws have based their case. The essay argues that prevailing notions of community are bureaucratic, reductive, static and essentialist and defeat their own declared objective of maintaining social pluralism, critiques the enmeshing of religious community with personal laws as a form of new orientalism that is both patriarchal and ideologically laden, and argues against positions advocating reform of personal laws by state or community. The author critiques ideologies of cultural diversity that rest on assumptions of discrete homogeneous communities, on religion as the singular axis of diversity, on a conflation of religion, culture and patriarchies, and on a confusion of social disparity with diversity, as all being incapable of reckoning with existing cultural diversity. The concluding section of the essay argues against the perception of religion or religio-legal systems as the sole determinant of patriarchies. Patriarchies cut across all primordial principles of social organisation, call into question the very principle of demarcating communities and personal laws that prevails at present and cannot be fought from 'within' by an identitarian politics. Multiple yet overlapping patriarchies should underpin new common laws that take into account existing axes of social differentiation even as they transcend such differences in the realm of rights. New laws must encourage a genuine religious plurality and be based on both the differences and overlaps between existing patriarchies. Inalienable rights for all women must be established while a new type of legal particularism should be instituted responding to the situational specificities of patriarchal arrangements.

With the long-awaited signs of industrial revival, the year that is about to close has given rise to new expectations. If these prove to be right and the tempo of industrial growth is sustained, the economy would have entered a new phase of development. The persisting problems, at least for a while, would be continued price rise and adverse current account balance, for which erstwhile solutions are unlikely to be effective. While some problems may get partly resolved and partly reconciled to, the real problems affecting the mass of the people will accentuate at the macro-economic level.||

To overcome the limitations of the secularists' 'heroic thought' one should heed the sociological distinction between secularisation as social process and secularism the ideology. The usefulness of this distinction is seen in regard to the minorities question: secularism as ideology divorced from the process of secularisation contributes to the process of minoritisation, leaving the door open for its stated enemies to function legitimately in the political system.||Dipankar Gupta

Indeed the very design of the current package of structural adjustment bears the imprint of this process and the sequel to the introduction of the package shows that the real mobility witnessed is that of finance rather than that of capital-in-production. But if globalisation of finance restricts the possibility of intervention within a 'national' (or for that matter, any supranational but restricted) space by undermining the concept of a 'control area', the question naturally arises: can there be any sort of an alternative to the current set of policies? It is the author's contention that a feasible alternative, not just a desirable one, to the existing policies exists.||Prabhat Patnaik,C. P. Chandrasekhar

Barring a dozen districts of the West Indo-Gangetic plains, no state as a whole appears to have reached the danger mark of groundwater over-exploitation.

But the decartelisation and de-Nazification begun after the German surrender in 1945 were stopped in their tracks by US foreign policy abetted by the most vocal protagonists of US corporate capital. Hitlers could come and go, but corporate capitalism and its leaders were the natural defenders of an inviolable social order that had always stood against the resurgent forces of international subversion. For Hitler's corporate paymasters, it was crime without punishment.||Frederic F. Clairmont

The commission has had to carry out its remit in a particularly difficult fiscal situation. Its projections of resources and requirements may not turn out to be realistic, but they set fair and reasonable goals. The commission has been stingy in respect of vertical shares and debt relief but in the current fiscal context this is not unforgivable. The adoption of an identical formula, predominantly based on population and the distance criterion, is a reform that is sound and progressive in its economic logic. The grants to local bodies, the establishment of a National Fund for Calamity Relief and the chapter on defence expenditure are noteworthy initiatives. The 'Alternative Scheme' suggested by the commission, though flawed and inadequate in its present form, may prove to be an important contribution if it stimulates thought and action on a rational restructuring of federal fiscal transfers. This paper evaluates the recommendations of the Tenth Finance Commission and outlines a scheme of federal fiscal transfers which, the author argues, is an improvement in several respects over the 'Alternative Scheme' proposed by the commission.||S.

The author seeks to demonstrate, in the first part of this note, how a certain form of hyper-rationalism characteristic of colonial modernity has impaired Indian marxists' capacity to engage with 'religion' (something without which India cannot be imagined). The second part of the note argues how colonial histories are particularly helpful in making visible what is sometimes called 'the unreasonable origins of reason'. And the final section endeavours to show - without attempting a general defence of post-structuralism - why post-structuralist and deconstructionist philosophies are useful in developing approaches suited to studying subaltern histories under conditions of colonial modernities.||Dipesh Chakrabarty

The land on which they happen to be is to be transferred to them, as something they own, and 'pucca' buildings are to be built for them by builders anxious to make profits out of the free-sale component that is offered as an incentive. A careful examination of the scheme makes it clear however, that implementing it is not a matter of really serious concern for the government. A few free lunches there may be, but nowhere near 40 lakhs.||Shirish B. Patel

Failure to properly administer the tax defeats its purpose and threatens the canon of equity. It increases evasion of tax and creates a parallel economy. Over the years there is an increasing realisation that in practice administration is law. In view of the important role of tax management in achieving the objectives of the given tax policy, this paper analyses the features of sales tax management in India and suggests possible improvements in it. In doing so, it presents the organisation for tax administration, analyses the operation of the tax including management information system (MIS) and suggests plausible improvements in both administration and operation of the tax. The policy prescriptions for improving sales tax management are particularly relevant in view of the proposed move to introduce a system of value added tax to replace sales tax in the states.||Mahesh C.

This paper reviews their use in both forms as a base-broadening accretion to the structure of conventional income taxation in place in less developed countries. The paper covers both schemes that are not sector-specific, such as minimum asset-based taxes on corporate entities, as well as sector-specific levies on the hard-to-tax sectors of agriculture, small business, and self-employed professionals. The purpose of the exercise is to extract lessons in terms of both design and administration for India, which is engaged in a process of seeking sustainable fiscal correction as a part of the stabilisation and reform process begun in mid-1991.||Indira Rajaraman

The analysis leads to the conclusion that there is substantial scope for public investment without adding to inflationary pressures. Such investment would in fact raise the overall saving ratio of the economy and reduce the investment-saving gap in the public sector. Also missing in the budgetary measures is a rational system of tariffs, taxes and subsidies based on considerations of both comparative advantage in production and comparative benefits from domestic absorption of goods and services.||Mihir Rakshit

The severe effect of economic and policy changes in the agricultural sector will be felt in the areas of agricultural trade and capital investments in agro-activities. This paper looks at the emerging evidence on these two crucial aspects of agro-sector and argues that there will be serious distortions with the emergence of the new trade regime, both internal and external, and the dominance of agribusiness corporations by way of corporate and contract farming. The penetration of the market into the rural economy will put pressure on the already marginalised sections and make small and marginal producers an assetless workforce. The only available mechanisms to reduce this impact will be producers' organisations of various types like co-operatives, informal groups and the political pressure groups.||Sukhpal Singh

28/1/1995- ||review of political economy, january 1995||4402319||Reconsidering Postmodernism: What Is New in the Old Lamp||This paper argues that the value of postmodernism derives from its power of negation. Its critique of objectivism and the 'metaphysics of presence' offers a new philosophical framework within which elements of the early critiques of enlightenment/modernity can be incorporated and given a more comprehensive form and analytic depth. However, when the concepts employed in the critique are transformed into affirmative norms, they yield an attitude of scepticism and nihilism within which every kind of 'coherent' and 'meaningful' enquiry becomes suspect. Consequently, to retain at least some of the philosophical insights of postmodernism, we need to make a distinction between its potentialities of negation and its norms of affirmation. We need also to rethink the concepts through which anti-foundationalism is given a positive content.||Gurpreet Mahajan

It argues that US imperialism has reached a critical stage in its evolution: the over-extension of the empire is causing the downfall of the domestic economy and society. Domestic economic reconstruction has been sacrificed for global corporate and financial expansion as the interests of the capitalist ruling class lie in foreign investments and global markets.||Chronis Polychroniou

Three major characteristics of classical political economy are identified: accumulation, class and the state. The agrarian question is considered, and the significance of these in its analysis is posited. With the agrarian question in mind, the importance of the comparative method is urged. Some problems associated with the comparative method are considered, and, in the political economy context, the strength of the case-oriented rather than the variable-oriented variant of the comparative approach is stressed.||Terence J.

Once a class becomes dominant, the autonomy of the bureaucracy ceases to exist and it becomes an instrument in the hands of the dominant class. In India, the growth of classes was stunted during the Moghul and British rule; in the post-colonial situation, no class was dominant. Since the Indian bourgeoisie is now in the process of establishing its dominance, Indian bureaucracy will soon lose its autonomy and power.||S. K. Das

However, like in the past, the emphasis on reducing fiscal deficits rather than increasing public savings robs the analysis much of the relevance. Also, its assertion that there is no further scope for expenditure compression and additional deficit reduction should be achieved by increasing taxes is not based on sound empirical analysis. In fact, such a recommendation may signal a spate of spending on populist schemes as has been seen recently. Similarly, attributing fiscal problems at the state level to inadequate revenue efforts is not based on facts. This can not only encourage profligacy, but also may introduce additional sources of inefficiency.||M. Govinda Rao,R. T. Shand,K. P. Kalirajan

One such structural reform suggested is the privatisation of railways. This paper examines the case for privatising Indian Railways, one of the largest rail networks in the world. The case is examined using the framework of the modern theory of contestability (which has underpinned the recent trends towards deregulation in the US), and the theory of property rights (which has provided the principal rationale for privatisation in the UK). The paper concludes that, viewed in welfare terms, considering the social burdens Indian Railways have been required to carry, the gains in productive efficiency accruing to the Railways from privatisation would be more than outweighed by losses of allocative efficiency and other non-commercial output which the country has enjoyed from the historical role the Railways have played in its socio-economic development.||M.

The period from independence up to the late 1960s was marked by a gradual liberalisation of attitude. The period from the late 1960s through to the 1970s was characterised by a more selective stance. The 1980s were marked by a certain liberalisation of policy. In 1991 India liberalised its policy regime further with respect to both inward and outward FDI as a part of reforms undertaken to increase the international competitiveness of Indian enterprises. This paper analyses the evolution of India's FDI position in these four phases of government policy and levels of industrialisation and development.||Nagesh Kumar

28/1/1995- ||special articles||4402324||Beyond 'Surpluses': Food Security in Changing Context||The present comfortable foodgrain situation should induce some hard thinking on the prevailing food security system rather than an attitude of complacency. The recent trends in agricultural production and the ongoing policy reforms for liberalisation of the economy and reduction in government deficits are the kind of changes which offer considerable scope for improvements in the food security system. It would be easier to implement such improvements when the food situation is comfortable. Further, success in reaching food to the poor depends not merely on improvements in the food security system but even more critically on the thrust of the broader development policies affecting agriculture and the rural poor. Here again, years of good foodgrain availability tend to be favourable for implementation of development policies and for focusing their benefits on the rural poor. Thus the present phase in our economy and agriculture is indeed an appropriate time to give serious thought to the past performance, present status and the priorities for the future directions of change in the food security system.||V.

Contrary to the a priori expectations, there was a sharp increase in rural poverty whereas only a moderate rise took place in urban poverty. Based on the examination of the factors governing rural and urban poverty and the supplementary empirical evidence, the paper reaches the conclusion that the economic reforms-related decisions contributed indirectly rather than being the only or the major cause of the sharp acceleration of rural poverty during the period under consideration.||Suresh D.

On the one hand, various perceptions of them in the colonial period converged in a strong disapproval and condemnation of their moral conduct. On the other hand, both in the colonial period and, more importantly, in post-colonial scholarship, the fact that some of these women were performing artistes of repute provided the ground for a feminist resurrection that separated them from those that did not belong to these privileged traditions and placed them in a newly created space that redefined and respected their freedom, autonomy and creativity. This study of the devadasi institution was undertaken with a two-fold purpose. First, it was an attempt to understand the relationship, and shifts in it, among women, religion and the state in pre-colonial and colonial south India. The second purpose was to try and disentangle this complex process, specifically to see how far the projects of colonialism, reform and revival were based on an understanding of the material reality of the practice.||Kalpana Kannabiran

They are shown to be underdeterminate. In a three-market economy they each equilibrate only one market. There are three problems: misalignment of currencies, volatility of exchange rates, and movement of hot money. The situation requires flexible relative prices of goods, appropriate money supplies, and a Tobin tax on currency transactions. Money demand functions have become unstable. In the absence of global co-ordination of national money supplies there is a case for an international agency to issue bond denominated in a basket of currencies, and to engage in open-market operation for world monetary stabilisation.||Ranjit Sau

Solutions that focus on only one of those, for instance the capital crisis in the case of Enron-type deals, are sub-optimal and defective solutions that aggravate other crises. In particular, special attention must be paid to the performance crisis of SEBs - any solution, such as Enron-type deals, that does not result in improving the technical and financial performance of the associated SEB is a wrong solution and must be rejected. Similarly, any solution that undermines, rather than strengthens, the capacity and human resources of the indigenous electrical equipment industry is an unacceptable solution. From a long-term point of view, the genuine solution to the crises of the electricity system is a shift to the new electricity paradigm, with the emphasis changing from energy consumption to energy services as an index of development.||Amulya K.

The results of the study are mixed, but in general they show that the social costs of reform, while they may have been low as compared to those in many other developing countries, are nevertheless high enough to demand a corrective course.||S.

This would mean that if the declining trend of public sector capital formation is not reversed, prospects of agricultural growth in the country are dim. This article takes issue with these contentions and claims, in particular with the hypothesis of complementarity. It attempts to provide an explanation of the behaviour of public and private capital formation in agriculture during the post-green revolution period in terms of its political economy, also examining the efficiency of capital use in agriculture in that period. The authors further argue that the relevant question is not simply investment in agriculture but for agriculture.||S. N. Mishra,Ramesh Chand

30/12/1995- ||special articles||4403624||Politics of Diversity: Religious Communities and Multiple Patriarchies||This essay reviews the current debate between maintaining religion-based personal laws and instituting a uniform civil code in the context of gender inequality and Hindu majoritarianism. It challenges the assumptions on which positions that advocate legal pluralism and defend personal laws have based their case. The essay argues that prevailing notions of community are bureaucratic, reductive, static and essentialist and defeat their own declared objective of maintaining social pluralism, critiques the enmeshing of religious community with personal laws as a form of new orientalism that is both patriarchal and ideologically laden, and argues against positions advocating reform of personal laws by state or community. The author critiques ideologies of cultural diversity that rest on assumptions of discrete homogeneous communities, on religion as the singular axis of diversity, on a conflation of religion, culture and patriarchies, and on a confusion of social disparity with diversity, as all being incapable of reckoning with existing cultural diversity. The concluding section of the essay argues against the perception of religion or religio-legal systems as the sole determinant of patriarchies. Patriarchies cut across all primordial principles of social organisation, call into question the very principle of demarcating communities and personal laws that prevails at present and cannot be fought from 'within' by an identitarian politics. Multiple yet overlapping patriarchies should underpin new common laws that take into account existing axes of social differentiation even as they transcend such differences in the realm of rights. New laws must encourage a genuine religious plurality and be based on both the differences and overlaps between existing patriarchies. Inalienable rights for all women must be established while a new type of legal particularism should be instituted responding to the situational specificities of patriarchal arrangements.

29/7/1995- ||review of political economy, july 1995||4403048||Economic Reforms as Ideology||This paper contends that the ongoing 'economic reforms' are a political ideology to shore up support for the use of power of the ruling resident non Indians (RNI). To understand an ideology one has to understand the power behind it. The existing power base is shifting from industrial to financial capital. As finance defines the power base, it promotes the ideology that makes financial capital respectable and desirable. The ruling RNI government knows well that these economic reforms define an ideology. Since they always had control of government, only minimal changes in the economy were needed. Hence, real functioning of the economy has not changed while its performance has become more depressing. A positive change will need a paradigm shift of ideas. Its underlying principle has to be integrative and not divisiveness.||Romesh Diwan

However, the current round of import liberalisation is producing an increasing number of features redolent of that earlier period. This article investigates the relationship between import liberalisation and development of industrial production, exports and technological capabilities. It concludes that import liberalism cannot be regarded as the optimum strategy for any country wishing to develop local production capabilities, and that some measure of import protection has to be in place for this development to take place. However, the case is made for a reactive government policy which can apply varying degrees of protection or liberalisation as the circumstances of external change and industrial development demand. Therefore, both the timing and phasing of policy changes will be important. Technical change and other factors are shown to have mediated some outcomes and to have constrained policy choices.||Richard Heeks

However population growth is not simply a problem of numbers; it is a problem of human welfare and development. This paper contends that population growth is not the only, or even the primary, source of low levels of living, eroding self-esteem and limited freedom in the less developed nations. Contrary to customary assumptions, population growth in conjunction with other determinants of development has on many instances promoted social change, and in the recent past has been a boon to economic growth in the newly industrialised countries. It is therefore an issue of management and optimum utilisation of present and future human resources.||Manashi Ray

In particular, China is close to the elimination of illiteracy in the younger age groups, while India is nowhere near achieving that goal. Educational disparities follow similar patterns in both countries, but tend to be sharper in India. China's lead in basic education was established during the pre-reform period, based on a strong commitment to the widespread and equitable provision of schooling facilities at an early stage of development. This contrast in educational achievements in China and India is crucial in assessing their respective development experiences and reform programmes.||Jean Dreze,Jackie Loh

This concern becomes important in the light of the evidence of the weak supply response of agricultural production. This paper examines the factors that determine exports of tea and observes that tea exports are insensitive to price incentives and to changes in world demand and decrease with increasing share of domestic consumption. It is also observed that the possibility of trade in tea links the domestic price of tea to the international price, suggesting that if trade in agricultural products is extended to essential commodities, their domestic prices are likely to rise. The experience of tea suggests that a policy of export of agricultural commodities, particularly essential commodities, cannot be recommended without caution.||T. Krishna Kumar,Ashok Mittal

These failures, in their totality, reflect the management's long-practised callousness towards miners' lives and well-being.||A. K. Roy

Mere talking of individual identities and differences among First and Third World women will not help the cause of women's emancipation in either world. Instead we should start looking for linkages between different groups of women without undermining their specific histories or the distinctions of nation, race, gender, caste and class. Sheila Rowbotham's writings should be read in the context of this need to create international links and bridges.||Vinay Bahl

Economic crisis and its handling by the creditors contributed to social and political destabilisation in the third world. Yet the commercial banks and the creditor nations insist on shirking all responsibility for the consequences of the debt crisis. The IMF and the World Bank have essentially acted as the custodians of these two players in the debt game and thus the debt strategy has served the banks well but has completely failed to free the LDC debtors from the predicament in which they are trapped. This essay is an attempt at a re-examination of some of these issues and argues that the present debt strategy is fundamentally flawed for several reasons and a radical restructuring is called for if alleviation of the debt crisis is indeed the aim.||Ashwini Deshpande

Against this background, the recommendations of the Tenth Finance Commission in its Alternative Scheme of devolution are appropriate and timely. The basic feature of the scheme, viz, the pooling of the receipts of all central taxes for the purpose of determining the share of the states, is likely to be generally acceptable. What is needed now is a suitable mechanism for formally eliciting different views on the scheme and examining these with a view to evolving a consensus.||B. P. R. Vithal

But a comparison of British India and the princely states of Baroda and Travancore, which had no separate electorates, suggests that such arrangements had less influence on the formation of communal identities than has generally been assumed. Rather, the demand for separate electorates may have been an effect rather than a cause of communalism.||Dick Kooiman
30/9/1995- ||review of agriculture, september 1995||4403270||Strategies for Agricultural Liberalisation: Consequences for Growth, Welfare and Distribution||This note summarises the results of a recently completed study which examined the impacts of trade liberalisation, agricultural input subsidy reductions and safety net programmes for India with an applied general equilibrium model with nine agricultural sectors, one non-tradeable non-agriculture sector and one tradeable non-agriculture sector and with five rural and five urban income classes. The study demonstrates the importance of accounting for large country effects in rice trade and estimates the optimal tariff/quota for rice exports for India - which is found to be just half a million tonnes of net export of rice. The results show that non-agricultural trade liberalisation is even more important for agriculture than even agricultural trade liberalisation, both of which help accelerate growth. The study concludes that a policy package involving trade liberalisation with moderate residual taiff as permitted under GATT and agricultural inputs subsidies removal accompanied by targeted safety net programmes along with stepped up investment in irrigation, with the expected additional foreign inflows materialising, produces a scenario that is superior from the point of growth, welfare and distribution and that this can be financed without raising taxes.||Kirit S.

It is argued that the reforms are guided by rules-of-thumb and the underlying general equilibrium model of the economy for which these standard rules apply is an unrealistic portrayal of most of the developing economies. The model holds good only under very restrictive assumptions, perhaps only for small economies and not large ones. Besides, while it is important to attain and maintain fiscal discipline, the IMF's approach has prolonged the process and invariably failed to yield the desired results.||Nirupam Bajpai

The analysis shows that, contrary to the claims of DPC, the levelised tariff for DPC's power will vary from Rs 3.44 per kWh to Rs 4.68 per kWh, depending on the price of oil, the plant load factor and the rupee-dollar exchange rate. For power from DPC to be viable for MSEB, the latter's average tariff will have to keep rising by over 14.5 per cent per annum over the 20-year period. And, just on account of the bloated capital costs of DPC and the abnormally high profits assured to it, MSEB will end up paying Rs 225 crore extra per year.||Girish Sant,Shantanu Dixit,Subodh Wagle

30/9/1995- ||special articles||4403278||Recent Research on Widows in India: Workshop and Conference Report||The concerns of widows cannot be dissociated from those of other single women, or indeed from those of women in general. Widows do experience special difficulties and deprivations, connected, inter alia, with the restrictions that are imposed on their lifestyle and the persistence of negative social attitudes towards them. In the context of social science research, it is right to give attention to widowhood as a particular cause of deprivation. And, in the context of social action, it is right to organise and support widows in their specific demands (e g, relating to pensions, property rights and other entitlements). But this does not mean that action has to take the form of working for or with widows in isolation from other women. The studies and personal testimonies summarised in this paper amply demonstrate that there are intimate links between the predicament of widows and a wide range of patriarchal institutions such as patrilineal inheritance, patrilocal residence and the gender division of labour. The cause of widows must be seen as an integral part of the broader battle against gender inequalities.||Marty Chen,Jean Dreze

While there are significant differences between the political economies of Kerala and Sri Lanka, a significant commonality is the presence of marxist/radical parties in mainstream politics. An unpacking of this commonality, with some critical variations inscribed within it, may contribute to making the Kerala model a little more intelligible.

If the mix was very much of their own concoction, the Chinese have learnt copiously from their own past and from the USSR as well as their own neighbours such as Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. The author's objective is not so much to chronicle the story, but to look for policy recipes for others, both developed and developing countries, underscoring the counter-productive nature of the neoliberal dogma.||Nirmal Kumar Chandra

This article examines the case of an income spreading mechanism which has been practised in the coastal encircling net fishery of Kerala for about half a century. It shows how a combination of inappropriate technology choices coming in the wake of free market policies, and a now increasingly common pattern of state patronage of rural producers, often combine to create open access conditions in common property resources and thus put eminently desirable communitarian systems of sharing and caring under great strain.||John Kurien,A.

This paper attempts to distinguish the comparative contributions of fertility decline and relative status improvement to trends in maternal mortality in India and presents evidence showing that advancement in women's demographic attainment may not necessarily involve improvement in their health and status.||Kirsty McNay

In order to release resources for higher investments in the agricultural sector, large-scale price and institutional reforms are needed to relieve the pressure of subsidies on the Exchequer. Under the circumstances, it makes much sense to improve terms of trade for agriculture and complement this by stepping up investment in agriculture through reduction in subsidies. The increased investment in agriculture appears to be a better bargain than short-sighted measures such as subsidies. This is because of the fact that cultivable land in India is in short supply and raising productivity per unit of cultivable area will require heavy investments in irrigation, rural infrastructure, research and extension. Also, investments in basic infrastructure correct for regional imbalances and promote greater equity at farm level, while subsidies tend to accentuate inequality.||Ashok Gulati,Anil Sharma

The female body is viewed as no more than a 'body-for-others', culturally constructed through media images and through women's internalisation of the gaze of the other. Thus what these women often experience as oppression is related to the denigration of a body-image and sexual identity. In conclusion, the author poses some questions regarding the possibilities of an autonomous femininity that would in fact enable these women to be free of the oppressive gaze.||Meenakshi Thapan

However, unless fundamental changes are brought about in the state fiscal administration along with proper targeting and rationalisation of the rice subsidy scheme, it is extremely difficult to cope up with the impending fiscal crisis. In a way, the present crisis should be welcomed as it has created a sense of urgency to speed up the process of the long-pending fiscal reform in the state.||J. V. M. Sarma

Such stereotypes are dangerous for they seem to mask the most frightening aspect of the emergency regime - its ability to draw all kinds of people, through fear, into participation. To ignore the active role of the thousands of men and women who competed for plots in the resettlement colonies of Delhi is tantamount to denying the generality and diffuseness of the power of the state as it seeped into the corners of everyday life, inviting strange and unnatural responses.||Emma Tarlo

04/11/1995- ||special articles||4403399||Film Studies, New Cultural History and Experience of Modernity||This analysis of the popular Bombay cinema starts with certain formulations about the audio-visual in the age of mechanical reproduction, drawing upon insights about the importance of the reproducible image in constituting a new sense of the self. The cinema's extended circulation of images afforded a framework of subjectivity that was intimately related to other mechanisms of extended imagining, and these formed the basis of a modern nationalist perception. Arguing against the idea that cinematic narration was engaged in a monolithic, unnuanced framing of this subjectivity, the author is concerned to understand the way mechanisms of narration turn back on the ostensible subject they construct to indicate the contradictory ways in which that subject is narrated. This analysis draws upon public discourses about the cinema to indicate the way reception was complicated by context.||Ravi S. Vasudevan
