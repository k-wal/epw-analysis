Inevitably conflicts and contradictions arise. This article focuses on the inherent conflicts and contradictions which come in the way of operationalising the concept of sustainable development in the context of Indian agriculture.||V. Ratna Reddy

Protesting against this invasion which will have a disastrous impact on the economy and the social life of fisherfolk, are both traditional fisherfolk as well as mechanised boat operators.||Ambrose Pinto,Berin Leekas,Latha Radhakrishnan

22/7/1995- ||commentary||4403014||Water Crisis in Earthquake-Affected Areas of Marathwada||Water should have been a primary consideration while planning the redevelopment of the earthquake-hit region in Marathwada given that water crises are annual occurrences. Instead emphasis was given only to 'seismic' considerations in the rehabilitation programme. This has inevitably led to a water scarcity which is likely to get worse.||G. K. Bhat,Aromar Revi
29/7/1995- ||special articles||4403055||Joint Forest Management: Superior Property Rights?||The forest departments in several states are collaborating with communities to regenerate forests by giving a share of the rights to revenues. This paper argues that high costs of excluding unauthorised use has compelled forest departments to accept this change in rights to forest lands. But we cannot expect forest departments to grant a meaningful role for the communities in forest management, because their primary motive is to reduce their costs.||Shashi Kolavalli
14/10/1995-21/10/1995||special articles||4403340||Public Intervention for Poverty Alleviation in Harsh Agro-Climatic Environment: Care of Rajasthan||Rajasthan is characterised by sharp regional contrasts in agro-climatic conditions as well as by fluctuating levels of rainfall and consequent frequency of drought conditions. Although there are regional variations in poverty levels, overall the state has a very low level of economic and social development, coupled with a negative record of achievements in poverty alleviation. An examination of the functioning of PAPs suggests that an emphasis on infrastructural development, especially watershed development and reforestation, along with programmes of employment and asset redistribution, is most needed in this state.||Vidya Sagar

26/8/1995- ||commentary||4403124||Constructing the 'Local': Decentralising Forest Management||While the concept of joint forest management is certainly a step forward from the centralised state-centred management systems, is it as participatory and decentralised as it has been claimed to be? What has been the experience of Tamil Nadu in implementing the concept?||Ajit Menon
19/8/1995- ||special articles||4403103||Colonialism and Environment in India: Comparative Perspective||Although colonial rule throughout the world was accompanied and supported by exploitation offorests and environmental destruction, independence has not put a stop anywhere to these processes. Rather, the disruption of the relationship between local societies and their natural resource bases has continued in the worldwide movement towards modernisation. Instead of contrasting this situation with a mythical golden age of equilibrium between society and nature, what is needed is a radical critique of capitalist expansionism, of which the colonisation of nature has been one of the major objectives.||Jacques Pouchepadass

25/3/1995- ||review of agriculture, march 1995||4402532||Planning Kerala's Irrigation Projects: Technological Prejudice and Politics of Hope||The political objective of achieving self-sufficiency in rice production in Kerala supported the planning of major irrigation projects in all the river basins of Kerala. The irrigation engineers who planned these projects showed a technological prejudice as they rarely sought alternative methods and scales of irrigation in each of these basins. This prejudice is of serious concern in a high rainfall area like Kerala, where the dam and canal-based system is 'naturally' costly and where there is a possibility of meeting the relatively small requirement of additional water through less expensive means. The objective of achieving self-sufficiency in rice and the policy of having major irrigation projects in all the basins seem to be based on the neglect of the specific agro-climatological and agro-ecological features of humid-tropic Kerala.||V. Santhakumar,R. Rajagopalan,S. Ambirajan
28/10/1995- ||special articles||4403372||Technology Priorities for India's Development: Need for Restructuring||Technology upgradation is a vital component of economic reform and is necessary to enhance international competitiveness, yet the pattern of technology funding does not reflect priorities inferred from economic development and growth objectives. An analysis of R and D expenditure in India shows that funding for technology in specific sectors is not in consonance with the size of domestic or global markets. The sectors which should be given priority - agriculture, industry, health and forestry - receive relatively less R and D funding. Thus India needs to restructure its technology priorities as well as make its R and D activities more market-oriented.||S. Chandrashekar
29/7/1995- ||commentary||4403043||Appropriating Environmental Concerns||Environmental issues have been included in the agenda of the World Trade Organisation despite the near unanimous opinion among environmental groups that liberalisation of global trade would itself be ecologically damaging. Environmental issues are already being misused to set up protectionist trade regimes that will selectively benefit developing countries.||Suman Sahai
15/7/1995- ||special articles||4402995||Economic Reform and Ecological Refurbishment: A Strategy for India||In a previous article, the degraded state of India's environment was documented, but the view that growth per se is the culprit was rejected. This article presents the case for an alternative economic strategy to SAP-'needs-oriented economic and ecological development' or NEED - which directs economic reforms to the fulfilment of basic needs, employment expansion and to a measure of environmental restoration and protection. Decentralisation and debureaucratisation of the public domain are advocated, but class and regional inequalities are recognised as formidable obstacles.||J. Mohan Rao
30/9/1995- ||review of agriculture, september 1995||4403274||Farmer Management of Public Tubewells in West Bengal||West Bengal has a large number of state-owned tubewells, catering to the needs of the vast number of marginal and fragmented landholdings. However, their poor management resulted in erratic water supplies and eroded farmers' faith in the system. The government, therefore, decided to hand-over all the shallow tubewells constructed under the World Bank scheme to local panchayat samitis. The democratic setup of the panchayati raj system was fully involved in the entire process from the allotment of tubewells to management of them. The study reveals that the overall performance of the tubewells was encouraging with the beneficiaries paying water charges on regular basis. However, delay in energisation and lack of adequate power supply during the peak requirement season led to some underutilisation of tubewells.||D. S. K. Rao

22/7/1995- ||special articles||4403022||Sonar Bangla? Agricultural Growth and Agrarian Change in West Bengal and Bangladesh||Drawing on papers presented in a workshop held in Calcutta in January 1995, this article reports on debates over the nature of the relationships between agrarian structure, agricultural growth and the state in West Bengal and Bangladesh. It scrutinises reports of rapid agricultural growth in West Bengal (and less spectacular but still significant agricultural growth in Bangladesh) since the early 1980s and expands the concept of structure to include structures of commerce, of bureaucracies, of exchange arrangements in land, water and labour, as well as changing ideologies of gender, caste and ethnicity. The local impact of the West Bengal Left Front government's agrarian reforms (including Panchayati Raj) are also analysed and trends in poverty in the two Bengals since 1980 are examined.||Ben Rogaly,Barbara Harriss-White,Sugata Bose
24/6/1995- ||commentary||4402904||Industrial Pollution and Workers' Health||The issue of occupational health is generally subsumed under the broad theme of environmental pollution and it is assumed that controlling industrial pollution automatically takes care of workers' health. A study of the leather tanning industry in Tamil Nadu underscores the problems of adopting such on approach.||Millie Nihila
24/6/1995- ||commentary||4402902||Forest and Other Sectors: Critical Role of Government Policy||Government policy with respect to forests mediates the role they play in the economy in their different aspects: as processors of the water cycle and of soil, as providers of livelihoods to and of habitats for wildlife and as suppliers of timber and other raw materials to industry. Clear policy directions are essential if forest resources are to be preserved and utilised.||Kanchan Chopra
08/4/1995- ||special articles||4402600||Magnitude of Groundwater Exploitation||Official statistics indicate a rather confusing picture of groundwater exploitation in India. As per the irrigated area figures of the Planning Commission, development of groundwater irrigation has reached disturbing levels in many states, notably UP. Gujarat, Punjab and Tamil Nadu. But the less known volumetric statistics in respect of groundwater irrigation compiled at the behest of the Central Groundwater Board are rather reassuring. Barring a dozen districts of the West Indo-Gangetic plains, no state as a whole appears to have reached the danger mark of groundwater over-exploitation. The reality is somewhere between these extremes, more likely nearer to the Board's than the Commission's assessment.||B. D. Dhawan

28/10/1995- ||special articles||4403374||Conservation in India: A New Direction||The ongoing debate about the justification, planning and management of India's wildlife protected areas between the wildlife conservationists and human rights advocates overlooks the fact that both wildlife and local communities are today equally threatened and have a common adversary in elitist state policies and the urban-industrial development process. This article argues that a reconciliation between the two is possible if local communities and government agencies evolve a partnership in conserving the habitats, with critical support from NGOs and independent researchers.||Ashish Kothari,Saloni Suri,Neena Singh
07/10/1995- ||special articles||4403305||People's Bill on Nature, Health and Education||The challenge today is to evolve a system of sustainable use of natural resources, conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of a good public health environment by creating appropriate institutions that would put to good use the potential for genuine motivation and detailed practical ecological knowledge of local communities. Several tentative moves have been made in this direction: joint forest management programmes, village level resource mapping, etc. These need to be consolidated, developed further and linked to the panchayati raj institutions. This article presents and discusses an alternative programme of action which has been formulated as the People's Natural Resource Management Bill.||P. R. Seshagiri Rao,Madhav Gadgil

27/5/1995- ||commentary||4402780||Popular Disillusionment at Root of Congress Split||With the Congress split, opportunities for political mobilisation to further the interests of the large majority of the people have increased. The challenge before the left and centrist parties is to make the most of these possibilities without allowing themselves to be beguiled by the Rao Congress to go soft on it because of the danger of the BJP fishing in troubled waters.||B.

21/1/1995- ||special articles||4402291||Transportation, Energy and Environment: A Case Study of Bangalore||Urban transportation in India is dominated by road transport where automobiles and trucks consume about 90 per cent of the total transportation energy out of which 80 per cent accounts for passenger transport. In Bangalore, an urban centre of South India, personal transport, particularly by two-wheelers, accounts for 60 per cent of total vehicle kilometres and their share in energy use accounts for 30 per cent of the total. This article, based on econometric analysis of annual data (1980-90), disaggregates passenger transport by vehicle type (two-wheelers, cars, buses, etc) and studies its impact on passenger kilometres and energy intensity. The study investigates the relation between transportation and energy consumption and its environmental impacts.||B. Sudhakara Reddy
01/4/1995- ||special articles||4402567||Whither India's Environment?||Orthodox economics has traditionally focused on the efficiency of resource allocation and avoided discomfiting questions concerning both the social equity of economic outcomes and their ecological entailments. This paper elaborates the nexus among economy, ecology and equity, using India as a case study. Key areas of the environment are surveyed and lines of causality between various economic factors and environmental degradation are analysed. In a companion paper, to appear later, alternative economic policies, directed at the fulfilment of basic needs and environmental protection, are explored.||J. Mohan Rao

14/10/1995-21/10/1995||commentary||4403326||Gaslitand Disaster: Accident or Murder?||Three distinct crimes on the part of the mines management can be identified in the Gaslitand mine disaster: the failure to prevent the waters of the river, swollen by unseasonal rains, from flowing into the mines, that to take expenditious action to rescue the trapped miners and, finally, the slow pace of dewatering of the mines which has extinguished all hope of any survivors among the trapped miners - those fortuitously saved by air-pockets - being rescued. These failures, in their totality, reflect the management's long-practised callousness towards miners' lives and well-being.||A. K. Roy

While they incorporate a more innovative and flexible approach to watershed management, they still continue to neglect important issues including gender-related problems and common property resources.||Abhas Kumar Jha

This article examines the impact of population growth and economic development separately, but with reference to the conjectured global warming between 1991 and 2100, with special reference to India.||Mahinder Chaudhry
26/8/1995- ||special articles||4403137||Evaluation of Narmada Projects: An Ecological Economics Perspective||Ecological Economics focuses on the theoretical and applied analysis of activities having potentially significant economic, ecological and social equity impacts. This paper illustrates how concepts of scale, uncertainty, and ecosystem health should be central to any decision-making and evaluation process. Disregard for these factors for the Narmada Valley projects largely invalidates the results of many previous analyses, which have typically relied on incomplete traditional cost-benefit analysis approaches.||H.
