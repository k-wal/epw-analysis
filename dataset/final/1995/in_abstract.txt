Inevitably conflicts and contradictions arise. This article focuses on the inherent conflicts and contradictions which come in the way of operationalising the concept of sustainable development in the context of Indian agriculture.||V.

Rather, the disruption of the relationship between local societies and their natural resource bases has continued in the worldwide movement towards modernisation. Instead of contrasting this situation with a mythical golden age of equilibrium between society and nature, what is needed is a radical critique of capitalist expansionism, of which the colonisation of nature has been one of the major objectives.||Jacques Pouchepadass
25/3/1995- ||review of agriculture, march 1995||4402532||Planning Kerala's Irrigation Projects: Technological Prejudice and Politics of Hope||The political objective of achieving self-sufficiency in rice production in Kerala supported the planning of major irrigation projects in all the river basins of Kerala. The irrigation engineers who planned these projects showed a technological prejudice as they rarely sought alternative methods and scales of irrigation in each of these basins. This prejudice is of serious concern in a high rainfall area like Kerala, where the dam and canal-based system is 'naturally' costly and where there is a possibility of meeting the relatively small requirement of additional water through less expensive means. The objective of achieving self-sufficiency in rice and the policy of having major irrigation projects in all the basins seem to be based on the neglect of the specific agro-climatological and agro-ecological features of humid-tropic Kerala.||V.

29/7/1995- ||commentary||4403043||Appropriating Environmental Concerns||Environmental issues have been included in the agenda of the World Trade Organisation despite the near unanimous opinion among environmental groups that liberalisation of global trade would itself be ecologically damaging. Environmental issues are already being misused to set up protectionist trade regimes that will selectively benefit developing countries.||Suman Sahai
15/7/1995- ||special articles||4402995||Economic Reform and Ecological Refurbishment: A Strategy for India||In a previous article, the degraded state of India's environment was documented, but the view that growth per se is the culprit was rejected. This article presents the case for an alternative economic strategy to SAP-'needs-oriented economic and ecological development' or NEED - which directs economic reforms to the fulfilment of basic needs, employment expansion and to a measure of environmental restoration and protection. Decentralisation and debureaucratisation of the public domain are advocated, but class and regional inequalities are recognised as formidable obstacles.||J. Mohan Rao
24/6/1995- ||commentary||4402904||Industrial Pollution and Workers' Health||The issue of occupational health is generally subsumed under the broad theme of environmental pollution and it is assumed that controlling industrial pollution automatically takes care of workers' health. A study of the leather tanning industry in Tamil Nadu underscores the problems of adopting such on approach.||Millie Nihila
07/10/1995- ||special articles||4403305||People's Bill on Nature, Health and Education||The challenge today is to evolve a system of sustainable use of natural resources, conservation of biodiversity and maintenance of a good public health environment by creating appropriate institutions that would put to good use the potential for genuine motivation and detailed practical ecological knowledge of local communities. Several tentative moves have been made in this direction: joint forest management programmes, village level resource mapping, etc. These need to be consolidated, developed further and linked to the panchayati raj institutions. This article presents and discusses an alternative programme of action which has been formulated as the People's Natural Resource Management Bill.||P. R. Seshagiri Rao,Madhav Gadgil
21/1/1995- ||special articles||4402291||Transportation, Energy and Environment: A Case Study of Bangalore||Urban transportation in India is dominated by road transport where automobiles and trucks consume about 90 per cent of the total transportation energy out of which 80 per cent accounts for passenger transport. In Bangalore, an urban centre of South India, personal transport, particularly by two-wheelers, accounts for 60 per cent of total vehicle kilometres and their share in energy use accounts for 30 per cent of the total. This article, based on econometric analysis of annual data (1980-90), disaggregates passenger transport by vehicle type (two-wheelers, cars, buses, etc) and studies its impact on passenger kilometres and energy intensity. The study investigates the relation between transportation and energy consumption and its environmental impacts.||B. Sudhakara Reddy
01/4/1995- ||special articles||4402567||Whither India's Environment?||Orthodox economics has traditionally focused on the efficiency of resource allocation and avoided discomfiting questions concerning both the social equity of economic outcomes and their ecological entailments. This paper elaborates the nexus among economy, ecology and equity, using India as a case study. Key areas of the environment are surveyed and lines of causality between various economic factors and environmental degradation are analysed. In a companion paper, to appear later, alternative economic policies, directed at the fulfilment of basic needs and environmental protection, are explored.||J. Mohan Rao

This article examines the impact of population growth and economic development separately, but with reference to the conjectured global warming between 1991 and 2100, with special reference to India.||Mahinder Chaudhry
26/8/1995- ||special articles||4403137||Evaluation of Narmada Projects: An Ecological Economics Perspective||Ecological Economics focuses on the theoretical and applied analysis of activities having potentially significant economic, ecological and social equity impacts. This paper illustrates how concepts of scale, uncertainty, and ecosystem health should be central to any decision-making and evaluation process. Disregard for these factors for the Narmada Valley projects largely invalidates the results of many previous analyses, which have typically relied on incomplete traditional cost-benefit analysis approaches.||H.
