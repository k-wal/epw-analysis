More than three-fourths of the minor irrigation potential expected to be created during the plan period is based on lift irrigation. Lift irrigation as a drought proofing mechanism is expected to make an unprecedented expansion during the Eighth Plan. This paper elucidates the distribution pattern of India's lift irrigation economy in terms of water and power sources as well as ownership, both within and across the four major hydro-geological regions of India, and brings forth certain theoretical and policy implications relevant to the current irrigation policies.||R.

The technology of subsurface drainage as a measure to control salinity and water-logging is technically and financially feasible. In the absence of an appropriate organisational set-up, the technology could not be widely adopted because its viability would be questionable. The management of saline and water-logged soils needs a community approach and collective vigilance. In this context, co-operatives may play a significant role. However, several factors will determine the success of drainage co-operatives. These are: (i) the problem of free-riders, (ii) disparity in benefits from drainage, (iii) variation in assets, caste and religion of members, (iv) participation of beneficiaries, (v) conflicting objectives between head- and tail-enders, and (vi) perception of the programme objectives. The participation score in managing saline and water-logged soils was found higher amongst poor farmers. Differential persuasion and education strategies may bring about the necessary participation to facilitate managing problem soils through co-operatives.||K. K. Datta,P. K. Joshi

It is now generally recognised that apart from making macro-economic stability, governments in developing countries must intervene in sectors like health care, education, infrastructural development and conservation of environment. This paper takes stock of what the developing countries have learned from experiments with interventionist policy and discusses some crucial issues in the development debate, namely, the role of the state vis-a-vis the market, agriculture versus industry and import substitution versus export-led growth.||Sudipto Mundle
03/4/1993- ||commentary||4399549||Farmers' Rights, Biodiversity and International Treaties||Who owns biodiversity? Can intellectual contributions that modify or record biodiversity be the instruments to establish rights to ownership over these resources? What are the modes for just and fair compensation to contributors of knowledge and genetic resources? These are questions that are central to debates surrounding the conservation and use of biodiversity and genetic resources and are directly related to implementation of the Biodiversity Convention. These questions have also been raised at negotiations on intellectual property rights (IPRs) taking place in GATT, and in the FAO.||Vandana Shiva

The paper makes an assessment of the implications of IRDP/NREP versus the land and water-related programmes for employment generation and natural capital regeneration, asset creation and environmental conservation.||Kanchan Chopra,Gopal K.

It examines the association between growth and instability and factors behind yield instability, using cropwise and disaggregated time series data. It then analyses the cost economics of Indian agriculture covering several crops and regions. This is followed by an impact assessment of watershed development programmes on dryland development in India. The authors observe that while irrigated crops and those with access to modern farm technology have dominated the growth process, dry crops and drought-prone regions like Karnataka in south India too have shared the gains of agricultural growth. But this growth process has been accompanied by higher instability in yields and increasing costs of cultivation. After analysing the factors responsible for this, the paper then discusses the various strategies and interventions needed to accelerate and promote sustained agricultural growth under diverse environments and constraints.||K.

The rural-urban disparities in access to drinking water persist and in the urban areas, in the absence of progressive pricing, a very large proportion of subsidised water is used by the higher income groups.

The logic of that metaphor has been used by states for seizing control of local commons on grounds of conservation. Report on a conference which sought to highlight research on common property systems that do function, the limits to local solutions to ecological dilemmas and the problems with state-directed environmental protection.||Subir Sinha,Ronald Herring

Such realism is necessary for a reasonable irrigation development strategy to be developed. This paper attempts to prove that major and medium irrigation potential in a fairly substantial sample of dams is determined by the variation of rainfall in the command, and it advocates inter-basin transfer of water across rainfall regions, from highly reliable to uncertain rainfall regions.||Dilip H.

05/6/1993- ||special articles||4399817||Famine Mortality||The giant misery of starvation caused by the alarming incidence of famine in the later 19th century was compounded by the appalling conditions of migration and over-crowding into which the starving poor were driven, often literally to death, conditions exacerbated by the official measures devised for famine relief. Worse, in the great famine years, by perhaps the cruellest of the many cruel ironies of famine history, rain which might have been expected to bring respite to the survivors of the drought instead intensified their suffering: epidemic malaria took its colossal toll. In other years drought, where it persisted, ironically limited mortality. But this saving grace was denied to the wretched populations of the submontane marshland and the waterlogged districts along the lower Western Jumna Canal, where irrigation, intended to solve the problem of famine, added its quota to the principal cause of famine mortality, malaria. The history of famine mortality raises many questions and the search for answers should lead to an understanding of famine more commensurate with its complexity. With the available groundwork of the detailed accounts of the outbreaks of famine in every province of British India and the manifestations of disease and the physical conditions associated with them, an epidemiological history of famine in south Asia becomes not merely desirable but a practical proposition.||Elizabeth Whitcombe

A project symbolising development has caused deprivation of people who have lived beyond 'development' strategies for centuries. As this report of the evaluation and monitoring agency for the Maharashtra submergence villages shows, the resettlement and rehabilitation process is faulty and satisfies neither the requirements of the Narmada Water Disputes Tribunal Award of 1972 or the bench-marks laid down by the World Bank's Independent Review in 1991-92.||

The ecological ideologues should be bemused no end at this wholesale disruption of the nation's economic and social agenda by the devotees of Hindutva. But irrational religiosity can be challenged, not by non-political greenpeaceniks, but only by an ideology based on rational processes of thought and backed by class power.||A. M.

While it is no doubt difficult to predict their impact with accuracy because of the complex interplay of various economic, social, political and ecological factors, it is possible to make some assessment based on past developmental trends in India and the experiences of other third world countries under similar programmes.||Miloon Kothari,Ashish Kothari

25/12/1993- ||review of agriculture, december 1993||4400590||Ground Water Overexploitation through Borehole Technology||In Karnataka state, as in many other parts of the country, well irrigation came into prominence since the 1960s. Since then rapid increase of wells and pumpsets took place. This resulted in sharp decline of water levels, which is more evident in the low rainfall, hard rock areas of the state, particularly in the four south-eastern districts of Bangalore, Chitradurga, Kolar and Tumkur. Detailed study of two small watersheds in Malur taluka of Kolar district and Davanagere taluka of Chitradurga district was conducted in February 1993 to understand the serious implications of water level decline in hard rock areas of Karnataka. Farmers tackled the problem of declining water levels by constructing bore wells, which actually triggered even more rapid decline of water levels because these structures, by virtue of their depth, are capable of yielding more water than the conventional dug wells. As a consequence, dug wells became dry and investment on them along with the pumpsets became infructuous. Thus, large number of farmers who had assured dug well irrigation a few years back are now deprived of irrigation because they did not have resources to attempt boring after the dug well became dry, or because the bore well they attempted did not prove successful. Such farmers have now switched over to dryland farming and the poorer among them are supplementing their meagre and uncertain farm income through agriculture labour.||D. S. K. Rao
