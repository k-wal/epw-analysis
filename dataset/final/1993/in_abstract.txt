The paper makes an assessment of the implications of IRDP/NREP versus the land and water-related programmes for employment generation and natural capital regeneration, asset creation and environmental conservation.||Kanchan Chopra,Gopal K.

But it will only aggravate the crisis, as it is financially, socially and environmentally unsustainable.||Shripad Dharmadhikary
03/7/1993-10/7/1993||commentary||4399931||Common Property, Collective Action and Ecology||Much modern discourse on environmental degradation takes place under the shadow of the 'tragedy of the commons'. The logic of that metaphor has been used by states for seizing control of local commons on grounds of conservation. Report on a conference which sought to highlight research on common property systems that do function, the limits to local solutions to ecological dilemmas and the problems with state-directed environmental protection.||Subir Sinha,Ronald Herring
20/2/1993-27/2/1993||------||4399417||Calcutta Diary||The money reportedly set aside for completion of the structure of the Ram Lala at Ayodhya could rehabilitate, several times over, the hundreds of thousands of villagers threatened with displacement because of the Narmada Valley-Sardar Sarovar projects. The ecological ideologues should be bemused no end at this wholesale disruption of the nation's economic and social agenda by the devotees of Hindutva. But irrational religiosity can be challenged, not by non-political greenpeaceniks, but only by an ideology based on rational processes of thought and backed by class power.||A. M.

The most challenging aspect of such a project is the effectiveness of inter departmental co-ordination. This study attempts a cost-benefit evaluation of Kandi watershed development project on socio-economic, environmental and execution aspects.||Karam Singh,H. S. Sandhu,Nirmal Singh,Balbir Kumar

While it is no doubt difficult to predict their impact with accuracy because of the complex interplay of various economic, social, political and ecological factors, it is possible to make some assessment based on past developmental trends in India and the experiences of other third world countries under similar programmes.||Miloon Kothari,Ashish Kothari
