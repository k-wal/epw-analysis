This paper discusses this issue with a view to suggesting a possible approach to moving towards VAT in a large federal economy such as India. The author discusses the various approaches to VAT in relation to other forms of direct and indirect taxes and describes how certain other federal economies have grappled with VAT. The issues associated with the switch-over to VAT in the Indian situation are then analysed and a possible model for VAT in India is proposed.||S. Gurumurthi

While most of the discussions on economic reform see growth as more or less an assured product of appropriate stabilisation and reform policies, this paper argues that simultaneous attempts toward stabilisation and economic liberalisation may lead neither to macro stability nor to the restoration of sustainable growth. In fact, the objective of stabilisation is in conflict with the objective of re-igniting growth in the economy. Different economies with different institutional relationships and varying lines of causality in their economic systems require different approaches to stabilisation and structural reform. A case-by-case approach is required with no prior bias in favour of liberalisation.||Nirupam Bajpai

The national policy on education (1986) and its subsequent appraisals in 1991 and 1992 seem to be tailor-made to suit the new economic policy.

Hindutva is not a response to 'pseudo'-secularism.

11/9/1993- ||special articles||4400142||Aspects of Structural Adjustment in West Africa and South-East Asia||Structural adjustment programmes in the 1980s and early 1990s have focused on using trade, fiscal and monetary policies to restore balance of payments equilibrium and stimulate growth in developing countries. These have taken shape against a background of global recession and severe external debts which started emerging over 1979-81. The policies have been underpinned by a shift in emphasis from state to market forces in organising economic activity. The agricultural sector has been expected to play a major role in this process, in order to boost output and foreign exchange. This paper explores aspects of structural adjustment in Nigeria, a major west African country, and the newly industrialising countries of south-east Asia, and the implications for development. The paper is divided into four sections. Section I outlines the background of structural adjustment and development. Section II looks at the impact of structural adjustment on growth and equity in Nigerian agriculture. Section III examines the factors which enabled the newly industrialised countries of south-east Asia to minimise the impact of the global recession, and hence the need for adjustment programmes. Section IV discusses the key insights for development which emerge from the analysis.||Sumit Roy

First, the fiscal stance is deflationary. Secondly, capital spending by government is down. For each of these reasons it is not at all clear that a recovery will be triggered or that private investment will take off. As far as the role of budgets go, perhaps, this one may be accurately described as non-inflationary. But then inflation does have other crucial determinants. Since the budget's book-keeping has been much lauded it bears mentioning that the revenue deficit is still with us, and growing. Apparently, the government's macro-economic adjustment programme is yet to catch up with its own consumption. Finally, for exports we have been provided with an enthusiasm rather than a strategy.||Pulapre Balakrishnan

The advantages that a literate population offers to the growth of a market economy form a central theme of this paper. At a different level, the discussion covers the implications of becoming literate in terms of 'what is there to read'.

Given its philosophical thrust it tries to understand the internal structure of the Marxian corpus of thought. To this effect it identifies the two mutually incompatible elements coexisting in Marx. The fact/value dichotomy or the dichotomy between science and morality is the expression of this incompatibility. Historically, the attempts to resolve this dichotomy have by and large failed because of their one-sided and dogmatic approach. These approaches seek to resolve this conflict by eliminating one in favour of the other and thereby they commit what may be described as either/or fallacy. These approaches grossly distort the complex conceptual system that Marxism represents. As against this, this article attempts to show that the resolution of fact/value dichotomy is possible by reconstructing Marx's concept of science on the one hand and his concept of morality on the other.||A.

The structure of the discussion in the paper is as follows. First, it considers the origins, the dimensions and the implications of the crisis in the economy. Second, it outlines the strategy of macro-economic stabilisation and structural reform adopted by the government in terms of its rationale. Third, it analyses the problems of adjustment and transition. Fourth, it examines the evidence on stabilisation, with a focus on the short term, to consider inflation and the balance of payments. Fifth, it explores the medium-term consequences of fiscal adjustment and structural reform for output and employment. Sixth, it highlights and evaluates the assumptions implicit in the strategy adopted by the government. Seventh, it draws together some conclusions that emerge in an attempt to outline the contours of an alternative view.||Deepak Nayyar

The amount of insurance per farmer was very low and less attractive in terms of compensation received. Therefore, the authors suggest that crop insurance scheme be made applicable to all the cultivators compulsorily and provide protection by guaranteeing 80 to 90 per cent yield in different tehsils according to the degree of risk. However, within the tehsil, insurance schemes can be uniform in terms of level of guarantee, premium and payment of indemnity.||M. M. Patil,S. G. Borude

It is, as a consequence, looked upon as stagnant. However, the informal sector can also be seen as being constantly built upon and transformed by people's own organised responses to given situations, often at times of crisis. This article aims to examine street vending as an informal sector activity undertaken by women in general and in the context of Chile from this perspective. Moreover, women in street vending challenge cultural values and beliefs that reinforce the stereotypes. Thus the street as a physical and symbolic space becomes the scenario upon which women defy the values which reinforce their subordination.||Lorena Nunez

The author first reviews the theoretical literature dealing with the distributional effects of stabilisation and structural adjustment programmes. This is followed by a brief survey of the empirical experience of countries in different parts of the world with respect to the social consequences of economic reforms. Finally, with the help of these theoretical and empirical insights, the issue is discussed in the context of the Indian economy using whatever limited data are available.||Ajit Kumar Singh

The current adjustment strategy makes sense only if it is seen as a combination of measures that hem the system in ways that render the rate of growth dependent on the confidence of international capital in the domestic economy. If current levels of confidence persist, then whenever net IMF inflows run out, growth would automatically be reduced to levels that equate the current account deficit to new foreign capital inflows. Thus the discipline that this strategy imposes is one that forces the system to tailor its needs to the requirements of international confidence. How meagre those needs are is left to the uncertain dynamics of international capital.||C. P. Chandrasekhar,Jayati Ghosh

More is wrong with India than just the planning of her resource generation and allocation. What India needs to do most is to focus, above all else, on devising radical and innovative strategies that can yield and sustain 5-7 per cent annual growth rate in the value of output of the agricultural sector; and recent experience suggests that in nations which have secured anywhere near such high growth rates, the state and its institutions of economic development have done more than just orthodox economic planning. This seemingly unachievable goal can be achieved, but only by redesigning the chemistry between the state and our institutions of economic development-our legal framework, our markets and our economic organisations in the private, public, co-operative and informal sectors. In Part I, the Indian agricultural and rural development policy; and in Part II, how it actually operates, are reviewed. Part III assesses the performance of the Indian state as a 'player' in the development process; in contrast, in Part IV, we highlight the contribution of institutions of development as 'players'. Part V explores what all is involved in rolling back the present 'awkward' state and rolling forth the 'subtle' state.||Tushaar Shah

We find that the structure of the industry has undergone a qualitative change. The industry, after decontrol, is characterised by a competitive outcome in terms of price and profit performance. An enquiry into the nature of inter-firm heterogeneities suggests that major differences arise out of technical factors. The performance of firms across strategic groups is different, with firms operating relatively new and large plants appearing to have an advantage. The persistence of this performance differential is likely to depend on how quickly the strategies adopted by these firms is matched by the other firms.||Subir Gokarn,Rajendra Vaidya

The technology of subsurface drainage as a measure to control salinity and water-logging is technically and financially feasible. In the absence of an appropriate organisational set-up, the technology could not be widely adopted because its viability would be questionable. The management of saline and water-logged soils needs a community approach and collective vigilance. In this context, co-operatives may play a significant role. However, several factors will determine the success of drainage co-operatives. These are: (i) the problem of free-riders, (ii) disparity in benefits from drainage, (iii) variation in assets, caste and religion of members, (iv) participation of beneficiaries, (v) conflicting objectives between head- and tail-enders, and (vi) perception of the programme objectives. The participation score in managing saline and water-logged soils was found higher amongst poor farmers. Differential persuasion and education strategies may bring about the necessary participation to facilitate managing problem soils through co-operatives.||K. K. Datta,P. K. Joshi

It is now generally recognised that apart from making macro-economic stability, governments in developing countries must intervene in sectors like health care, education, infrastructural development and conservation of environment. This paper takes stock of what the developing countries have learned from experiments with interventionist policy and discusses some crucial issues in the development debate, namely, the role of the state vis-a-vis the market, agriculture versus industry and import substitution versus export-led growth.||Sudipto Mundle

This article discusses the socially structured and often sanctioned forms of indirect agency in their specific articulation of consent and resistance as significant signs of the ways in which men and women make their history or are inhibited from doing so.||Kumkum Sangari

First, there is the issue of restoring growth under conditions of macro-economic equilibrium, the major stated objective of the structural adjustment programmes (SAPs) and the neo-liberal agenda. Second, there is the social dimension of SAPs, as even in the most successful cases of economic reform the social impact has been generally negative. The third dimension of SAPs identified and discussed here is the strategic (intellectual and political) response of groups and organisations in civil society. This issue is of critical importance in both theoretical and political terms, as it relates to the need to reformulate an alternative strategy to the SAP.||Henry Veltmeyer

A Polemical Essay||Was the Soviet experiment doomed from its inception, as the 'totalitarian' school of western scholars has maintained? Their main arguments are: the seizure of power in 1917 was an anti-democratic coup d'etat leading necessarily to a one-party state, Stalin was the logical heir to Lenin, and industrialisation through forced collectivisation was the corollary to the dogma on state planning; even when growing weaknesses came to light, every attempt at radical reform, political or economic, from within came to nought because of the incompatibility with the monopoly power of the party-state. This article questions each of these assertions by exploring the political alternatives to the actual course of history that emerged at some crucial moments, the Soviet debates on alternatives to command planning; the factors leading up to perestroika and why it failed, and finally the meaning of democracy and 'legitimacy' in the Soviet context.||N.

Each new eruption of hostility recalls the bitter and divisive erosion of social relations between Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs. Official and historical accounts of Partition see it as the unfortunate outcome of sectarian and separatist politics and as a tragic accompaniment to the promise of freedom. This article, a perspective from the margins, attempts to piece together the fractured reality of the time through social histories and tries to communicate an experience of Partition through women who were destituted in one way or the other by the events. The material is presented in three voices: the voice of the government, bureaucrats and members of parliament, the women themselves and of the social workers to whom the work of rehabilitation and resettlement of recovered women was entrusted.||Ritu Menon,Kamla Bhasin

Among the simulated policy interventions, redistribution of land by itself is least effective in reducing poverty. The most important policy intervention for poverty alleviation is the complete package of land with a pair of bullocks and a minimum of eight years of schooling. Increasing education levels, providing a pair of bullocks, increasing irrigation by 40 per cent and increasing wage rates are equally effective in reducing poverty in the semi-arid tropics.||R. P.

This paper shows that by the PPP criterion, the currencies of developing countries are undervalued, not overvalued as the conventional wisdom maintains. It proves that trade with such undervalued currency implies an adverse unequal exchange. For foreign capital now there are two channels of profit: production, and trade. Gains from unequal exchange deters foreign direct investment. Nowadays the volume of asset transaction far outstrips the merchandise trade in world markets. This paper argues for an extension of the PPP measure to include assets as well as current products. The UN International Comparison Programme ought to take note of this aspect.||Ranjit Sau

While the first objective has yielded some interesting and important insights, the second has led to results which have been, at best, problematic, and, at worst, tediously neo-antiquarian and remarkably unremarkable in their banality.

It examines the association between growth and instability and factors behind yield instability, using cropwise and disaggregated time series data. It then analyses the cost economics of Indian agriculture covering several crops and regions. This is followed by an impact assessment of watershed development programmes on dryland development in India. The authors observe that while irrigated crops and those with access to modern farm technology have dominated the growth process, dry crops and drought-prone regions like Karnataka in south India too have shared the gains of agricultural growth. But this growth process has been accompanied by higher instability in yields and increasing costs of cultivation.

The results suggest that while the most important determinants are parental education and economic status, family size has a consistent effect on the situation of children and their gender roles in particular. The situation of daughters in small families continues to be unchanged and in some ways worse: They are no more likely to be educated than those in large families and with the shrinking labour supply of sons, shortfalls are taken up by daughters, and especially older daughters, who, at the cost of securing an education, now spend considerably more time than both girls in large families and their brothers in small families in working in non-domestic activities.||Shireen J.

Underlying this most unsettling discontinuity in the modern era is not just pervasive globalisation and its various concomitants, such as consumerism and commercialisation of diverse human endeavours through their marketisation, but a basic crisis of vision, a decline of engagement with Utopias, an end of 'alternatives' in the real and comprehensive sense of the term. Not just the erosion of alternative centres of power and systems of 'development' and governance (the collapse of both the socialist and the third world poles) but, though partly related to that, erosion of ideological perspectives, frameworks of knowledge and modes of consciousness.||Rajni Kothari

Competing imports have displaced entire segments of industry oriented towards the internal market; producers often transform themselves into importers. The plight of rural producers is even more dire; the onslaught against the peasantry has intensified. The apparent beneficiaries of an internationalised economy, such as the assembly operations, the auto and computer industries, the financial intermediaries and tourism, are certainly generating attractive profits for their owners and sizeable volumes of 'non-traditional' exports, but they do not create sufficient employment opportunities to meet the needs of the labour force, nor will they redistribute income since they are tightly controlled by a small financial elite.||David Barkin

However, influential critics soon dismissed the relevance of the new theories to practical policy, especially in developing countries. This paper argues that imports of developing countries are frequently supplied under conditions of imperfect competition, and that consequently the environment for strategic import policy exists. This is first illustrated by indirect empirical evidence, and then with reference to historical and institutional features of developing countries' import trade, reinterpreted in the light of modern theories of industrial organisation.||Aditya Bhattacharjea

27/11/1993- ||review of industry and management, november 1993||4400447||Uneven Development of Engineering Companies in India: Spatial Dimension of Competitive Advantage||This paper examines the spatial dynamics of the process of industrialisation in India. The engineering sector is regarded as the propulsive force at the core of this process and the focus of analysis here is, therefore, on the profile of development and the changing spatial configuration of the public limited companies in that sector. The theme is addressed within the framework of the discourse on the competitive advantages of industry. A detailed analysis of the performance of 840 engineering plants across the country yields significant region-specific and location-specific variations. It also yields strong evidence to show that the historically determined macro-economic and macro-social processes which create the building blocks of competitive advantage for industry are also inherently space-differentiating. In conclusion, the paper argues that a clearer understanding of the ways in which competitive advantages become, and stay, embedded in space over long periods, and an explicit incorporation of that understanding in the industrial policy framework, will become increasingly crucial for the management of a liberalised economy.||Suranjit K.

The war in the Persian-Arabian Gulf was a case in point, for it was less the result of a failure of international diplomacy than a deliberate strategy of the US government to exacerbate a crisis as a pretext for intervention. At stake were not merely the price of oil, human rights, or military victory. Of far more fundamental importance were, and still are, the sustained recycling of petrodollars into the western industrialised states, support for faltering US economic and financial dominance, and reassertion of US military and political hegemony in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union as a countervailing superpower. This retrogression to colonial-style armed force signals a new era in which the only remaining superpower will seek to enforce by any means necessary its economic centrality and political pre-eminence in the face of underlying economic weakness.||Sharat G.

As part of the former, investment from the central government budgetary resources has been relatively reduced. We estimate that had the investment been maintained at the historical average rate relative to gross domestic product, and one-third of the additional output were collected as tax, the entire budget deficit of 1993-94 could be covered. The budget for 1993-94 is designed to consummate structural reform. Custom duties have been lowered. We demonstrate that the expected gain in balance of payments would be eroded in part as the foreign suppliers would now raise their prices in response to lower tariff.||Ranjit Sau

Drawing upon a case study undertaken in Dindigul district in Tamil Nadu this paper describes the conditions of women workers in this hazardous industry and raises the question of whether the current pattern of industrialisation without regard to the impact of certain hazardous industries on workers should be encouraged.||Millie Nihila

06/11/1993- ||special articles||4400383||The 'Beshya' and the 'Babu': Prostitute and Her Clientele in 19th Century Bengal||In all its various manifestations, the profession of prostitution reflects the domination of the male over the female. This is particularly true in a capitalist society where, like other wage workers in a system that thrives on intensification of division of labour and specialisation of skills, the prostitute is condemned to the exclusive role of a specialist in sexual entertainment. Stripped of all emotional and intellectual attributes, she becomes the female body. Reduced to a source of purely utilitarian needs, her body is required to produce the regular nocturnal fantasy of pleasure that deceptively fills up the vacuity of the soul of the alienated worker who comes to her as a client. This paper examines the transformations that the profession of prostitution and its clientele underwent with the introduction of new commercial and administrative relations in the 19th century colonial Bengal.||Sumanta Banerjee

Partisanship has to take into account a multi-faceted nationalism, all aspects of which were complicit with power and domination even when they critiqued western knowledge and challenged colonial power. This article contends that colonial structures of power compromised with-indeed, learnt much from-indigenous patriarchy and upper caste norms and practices which, in certain areas of life, retained considerable hegemony. Legislative activity on Hindu marriage issues in the last few decades of the century forms the discursive field for this exercise.||Tanika Sarkar

As a natural corollary, we have this new face of imperialism-the continued exploitation of the developing countries, not by the flow of capital for the extraction of raw materials, but by direct intervention in the production patterns in the developing countries in order to ensure market access for the products and services of the developed countries. This can be achieved, and has so far been achieved, by the co-option of the elite in the developing countries by the forces of modern capitalism.||Arun Ghosh

The size and internal efficiency of the synthetic fibre producers will determine the substantial growth of India's garment export industry in the future. Therefore, while the long-term policy should be aimed at strengthening and diversifying our domestic textile base, the short-term solution will have to centre around facilitating the import of fabric.

The employment elasticity in the manufacturing sector turns out to be as low as 0.2. Further, the employment growth in the private organised manufacturing has been negative during the 80s. Employment projections for the 90s based on the sectoral employment elasticities in the 80s reveal that there is a substantial addition to the volume of unemployment in the first two years of the structural adjustment programme. Even a very optimistic growth scenario fails to eliminate the backlog of unemployment by the end of this decade. This is mainly due to the dominance of the primary sector in the employment structure; whereas the major focus of the structural reform is on the growth of manufacturing sector.||B. B.

This would imply assisting them to implement the programmes of economic reform that they have launched, and to create a trade and investment environment for them so that their development efforts can be sustained through increased resource flows and foreign exchange earnings. At the same time, aid and development policies will have to continue to serve their traditional objective of supporting long-term development programmes of building infrastructure and financing projects of substantial social benefit such as investment in rural development, health, nutrition, education and poverty alleviation. This paper elaborates on these aspects of aid and development policies in the 1990s. The author first relates these policies to their traditional objectives and then spells out the implications of the new objectives for their design. Finally, the potential source of resources for implementing aid and development policies in the altered international economy of the 1990s is analysed.||Arjun Sengupta

These processes had a direct bearing on communal representation and reservations at the ideational and pragmatic levels as functional imperatives of the colonial administration. Central to the discourse on communal representation and reservation of this period, the related administrative process and the non-brahmin response to these were the statistics collected from time to time. These made the non-brahmins and the British officials increasingly aware of the structural cleavages in south Indian society of brahmins versus non-brahmins, Hindus versus Muslims, and so on. Such awareness in turn sharpened these cleavages, pitted the non-brahmins against the brahmins and gradually paved the way for the non-brahmin movement.||P. Radhakrishnan

This notion is manifested in the present sexist housing and settlement policies which are rooted in the recommendations of several public service review commissions in the past. Gender stereotypes are used to marginalise women and discriminate against them in public housing and settlement networks and their special needs remain unidentified. This article focuses on urban housing in Kampala city, mainly because the scramble for land, housing and settlement is in the urban world where it is warranted by the scarcity of resources against an ever increasing population.||Hilda Ntege

The main drawback of both these approaches lies in this attitude to nationalist ideology. This paper suggests a different approach on the basis of a case study-the genesis and development of Hindu nationalism as ideology. Emphasising the relevance of the 'invention of tradition' in illuminating the emergence of the Hindu nationalist ideology the essay presents the hypothesis that it is possible to treat this ideology as a sub-category of this invention process, a sub-category called 'strategic syncretism'-syncretic because it has been culled from cultural values of groups perceived as being antagonistic to the Hindu community and strategic because it underlies an ideology that seeks to dominate the 'others' in terms of prestige as well as on a concrete socio-political plane.||Christophe Jaffrelot

Hidden under its apparent simplicity there are many complex facets, failure to recognise and take account of which may result in the wrong kind of globalisation. Given the structural characteristics of a typical less developed economy, it is essential that the notion of competitiveness is grasped in its full complexity before an appropriate reform package is presented. Unfortunately, there are reasons to suspect that this awareness is particularly lacking in the current Indian context.||Kalyan K. Sanyal

It distinguishes between two kinds of discriminatory effects when the female is at a disadvantage-those effects which are due to behaviour which is consciously or directly discriminatory and part of some larger 'strategy' and those effects which are due to behaviour conditioned by calculations not directly related to effecting a sex differential in welfare, except in some long-term historical or institutional sense. This distinction is important because the intervention-points suggested to narrow the gender gap are different in the two cases.||Alaka Malwade Basu

The finance minister is aware that fiscal imbalances are still large and that the economy is still vulnerable to external shocks and that, therefore, there is no room for complacency. Nevertheless, by exuding so much quiet confidence, he is creating a general mood of complacency. Reduced customs and excise duties have added to this mood, creating expectations that next year not only will these indirect taxes be further reduced, but also direct taxes will be reduced. This may be politically wise in the short run, but may prove disastrous in the long run, not much longer than the end of the century.||V. M. Dandekar

It claimed the equal validity of all cultures and questioned theories of progress culminating in Europe. It then reinterpreted Russian history to locate the origins in the Mongol dominion of the 13th-15th centuries. As such Russia is multi-cultural from the beginning for which they advocated the strategy of the 'symphonic personality' inspired in part by Dostoevskii's 'polyphony' in his novels.

Yet it is difficult to find even a single theoretical article on the historical or contemporary forms of feminist internationalism. There is, also, limited historical or contemporary research directly on the problem. It is therefore necessary to first ask why this might be so and then suggest how the vacuum might be filled. The extensive literature around the subject does provide a sufficient basis for such theorising. There also exists a relevant body of feminist and other emancipatory writing which could contribute to the construction of such a theory. There remains a need for identifying the various possible fields for specialised research, and rubrics for possible overviews. We also need theoretically-informed studies of cases, types, forms and axes of international solidarity with and between women.||Peter Waterman

10/4/1993- ||special articles||4399586||Dissection of a Bold Budget||Barring adverse harvests or oil price movements, the 1993-94 budget is likely to increase the industrial growth rate, without significantly increasing inflation. The balance of payments situation may, however, deteriorate, resulting in downward pressure on the rupee, necessitating intervention by the RBI to stabilise the exchange rate. The resource mobilisation assumptions underlying the budget projections for 1993-94 appear to be slightly optimistic. Nevertheless, the likely increases in customs and excise revenues and direct tax receipts should cover the effects of the duty concessions. There is some uncertainty, however, about the ability of public enterprises to raise enough resources through market borrowings to implement plan outlays. In terms of the aim of longer term structural adjustment, the fiscal policy of the government appears to be successful in reducing government borrowing, but unsuccessful in stepping up investments, particularly in infrastructure. Detailed aspects of tax policy are appraised and some suggestions for administrative initiatives and for insurance market reform are offered.||Arindam Das-Gupta,Dilip Mookherjee

The budget is soft on the affluent sections of the population and harsh on the states.

Three issues particularly brought new sections into the public arena. The Deorala sati, the Mandal commission and the Ayodhya temple issue. This article examines communal violence in Jaipur with special reference to the 1990 incidents through three narratives: (1) the ideology and organisation of the BJP in Rajasthan and its supporting organisations, (2) the orientation of the state apparatus especially the police, and (3) the regional print media. These three narratives, it is argued here, constitute a master narrative which frames individual consciousness and action and threatens to become hegemonic. Instances of individuals trying to protect those attacked are indices of resistance to the communal ideology, and counter and challenge boundaries constructed by begemonic ideological framework grounded in otherness.||Shail Mayaram

More than 1.5 million ethnic Tamils from south India were enumerated in 1931 in other (mainly British) colonies where they had poured in during the previous one hundred years. A typical feature of Tamil emigration was the 'kangani' system in which labour recruitment from India and supervision on the plantations were in the hands of Tamil headmen. Tamil workers were sent mainly to the newly developed plantations, but they were also active in the urban economy. Ceylon, Malaya and Burma were the main recipient countries of Tamil labour. Other colonies (including French ones) received only several thousands of workers. After independence former colonies with strong local pressure groups tried and got rid of what they saw as disturbing legacy of the British period. In this paper an attempt is made to interpret migration processes in terms of migratory cycle. The cycle of migration streams is divided into three phases: perfect regulation, growing independence, government-controlled termination. These stages of the cycle correspond to the progressive constitution of a permanent migrant community in receiving countries. Such a pattern can help analyse other examples of international labour migration in the contemporary situation.||Christophe Z. Guilmoto

In theory it generates a very complex dynamics. The equation is estimated with quarterly data of US dollar relative to the SDR, 1974-1991. It is utilised to forecast the value of dollar up to the first quarter of 1995. The dollar, it appears, will be in the upswing in the near future. It will remain all through at a higher level than presently. Hence, the Indian rupee, if made fully convertible, would depreciate relative to dollar.||Ranjit Sau

What the Indian Muslims need, however, is not sympathy but understanding, based on a sociological study of their differentiated and pluralist society. Tracing the vicissitudes of the Muslim psyche and politics since partition, the author argues that such a study is indispensable for evolving an insight into the neglected but vital ethnic dimension of the Muslim urge for self-identity.||Balraj Puri

But does this tendency of technology import generate efficient utilisation of inputs when the process is becoming more capital deepening as reflected in rising capital coefficients? This study aims at revealing some interesting phenomena regarding the performance of Indian manufacturing industries over the period 1974-75 to 1985-86. First, the growth of output in individual industries and their corresponding changes in capital coefficients have been studied. Second, a decomposition analysis has been done to find out the factors responsible for the rise in capital-output ratio. Finally, the question of efficiency is examined from the relationship between capital-labour ratios and labour productivities by a comparative static analysis over different time spans. The study shows that while output grows at a very moderate rate, capital coefficients, on the other hand, rise at remarkably high rates. But this increasing capital coefficients fail to produce higher labour productivities across industries. Hence inefficiency of input used is the order of Indian industries during the period under review.||Dipankor Coondoo,Chiranjib Neogi,Buddhadeb Ghosh

However, as explorations on the experiences of women during Partition show, it is difficult to arrive at general conclusions about women, history and their agential capacity. Women have often played out multiple and overlapping identities. An understanding of agency also needs to take into account notions of the moral order which is sought to be preserved when women act, as well as the mediation of the family, community, class and religion. The focus of this paper is on the related questions of women's agency and violence. It first looks at particular incidents that took place before Partition in Rawalpindi, in March 1947. The second section examines how the newly formed nation state dealt with the question of women after Partition and the third, through memoirs and personal accounts, the relationships between women who worked on behalf of the state with the state, and the women they worked with.||Urvashi Butalia

17/7/1993-24/7/1993||special articles||4399965||Multiplication of Nations? Political Economy of Sub-Nationalism in India||The nationality formation process in India has reflected itself in multiple ways: in the growth of respective vernacular literature, agitation to establish particular languages as official languages of particular areas, movements of backward nationalities to break away from an advanced nationality and earn recognition for themselves, the movement of a particular nationality group, which was separated from the parent nationality and was living amidst a different cultural group as a result of administrative unitisation, to rejoin the cultural mainstream and, lastly, the movement of groups which are still at a tribal stage of development but have struggled against the exploitation and encroachment of outsiders to have a province of their own to minimise exploitation and encroachment. In a country where capitalism is slowly reaching new areas and awakening new cultural groups to life, the stream of sub-nationalistic uprisings seems to be unending. New demands and aspirations continue to surface, some of which are demanding complete independence, not just self-rule. The Indian nationality question cannot be studied in exclusion of these aspects because the culmination of this process can alone prove whether India has been a nation-in-the-making or a nation-in-the-unmaking.||Sajal Nag

05/6/1993- ||special articles||4399817||Famine Mortality||The giant misery of starvation caused by the alarming incidence of famine in the later 19th century was compounded by the appalling conditions of migration and over-crowding into which the starving poor were driven, often literally to death, conditions exacerbated by the official measures devised for famine relief. Worse, in the great famine years, by perhaps the cruellest of the many cruel ironies of famine history, rain which might have been expected to bring respite to the survivors of the drought instead intensified their suffering: epidemic malaria took its colossal toll. In other years drought, where it persisted, ironically limited mortality. But this saving grace was denied to the wretched populations of the submontane marshland and the waterlogged districts along the lower Western Jumna Canal, where irrigation, intended to solve the problem of famine, added its quota to the principal cause of famine mortality, malaria. The history of famine mortality raises many questions and the search for answers should lead to an understanding of famine more commensurate with its complexity. With the available groundwork of the detailed accounts of the outbreaks of famine in every province of British India and the manifestations of disease and the physical conditions associated with them, an epidemiological history of famine in south Asia becomes not merely desirable but a practical proposition.||Elizabeth Whitcombe

This policy framework is being used extensively and indiscriminately by these multilateral agencies for setting instruments of conditionality for lending. As this problem is seriously affecting the lives of a very large number of the poor in the developing countries, the subject should no longer be confined to the economic and bureaucratic corridors, but should be taken to the proverbial common man in the street.

While the PSEs' internal resources in financing their investment increased distinctly, the same for the private corporate sector declined, both converging to similar levels by the end of the 80s. A statistically significant trend increase in the PSEs' capacity utilisation is also discernible for 1978-79 to 1990-91. These results, strengthening our earlier findings, seem to question the implicit premises of the ongoing reforms of the public enterprise sector in India.||R. Nagaraj

The essay begins by critically examining the reforms, especially with respect to the international sector, the divestiture plan and programmes for basic needs.

In contrast the inadequacy of an integrated historiography of crime and public order in the Indian context has stood out sharply. The present paper seeks to fill the gap by constructing a quantified chronology of crime and criminality between 1864-1912 covering Bengal proper and each of its five revenue administration divisions.||Arun Mukherjee

On the other hand, they have made very little effort, so far, to harmonise their economic policies. Their economic policies, adopted under domestic political and economic compulsions, have only contributed to the fragmentation of the inherited common economic space.

The recent lowering of the rate of inflation and the increase in the growth rate of the economy have more to do with a good monsoon than with the NEP. The industrial sector continues to be in the grip of a recession. Foreign exchange reserves are high because of borrowings and the industrial recession. Evidence also points to growing disparities, rising unemployment, deterioration in living conditions of the majority of the people, de-industrialisation, deteriorating environment, loss of food security, decline in technological capability and decline of the public sector. With opening up, the economy has become far more unstable than earlier and the impact of this will fall on the already marginalised in society.||Arun Kumar

It may be convenient for the IMF and the World Bank to blame successive governments in Dhaka for their failure to implement reforms and for current Bangladeshi regimes to attribute the poor results to the malfeasance of their predecessors. But a decade of economic stagnation needs more substantive and less self-serving diagnosis if Bangladesh is to join the ranks of a resurgent South Asian region, let alone its more dynamic neighbours to the east.||Rehman Sobhan

To combat the baleful symptoms of this, the military is more likely to use the factor of Yeltsin's political debt to it to garner revenues and personnel, to consolidate its role as arbiter of scarcity in the localities or, internationally, to push for an upward revision of the conventional armed forces terms on Russian deployments in the Caucasus than to urge a militarised polity.||Arup Banerji

This paper develops a framework to explore the structural configuration in the Indian automobile industry in terms of investment strategies deployed by various constituent firms.

Strategic investments on research and development, plant expansion and modernisation, material and machine tool import dependence and capital intensity are analysed through innovative indexing of data.

12/6/1993- ||special articles||4399844||Marxism: The Dilemma of Critique||The possibilities of inscribing revolutionary ideas, advanced at the level of critique, into material conditions are today debated with unprecedented urgency. To talk of the ever-renewed agility of contemporary capitalism does not mean that as a determinate, historical specification of tendencies of forces, capitalism no more acts as a ceaseless mechanism of expropriation. Indeed, it refers to its powerful 'ideological semiotic' through which it explains its hierarchical and corporatist power structure in the mystificatory terms of meritocracy and expansion, and retains its hegemony over competing radical projects. In contrast, as the results of the experiments of eastern communism are becoming known, the Leninist response of smashing the state apparatus stands today as an unquestioned negative utopia. Together, they bring to bear in a cruel way the important fact that there exists neither a linear process of social integration nor a simultaneous contradiction between the growth of consciousness in political organisations on the left and the development of capitalism. This paper questions the tradition of critique in Marxism and focuses on its manifold dilemmas. Towards this aim, it examines a variety of contemporary readings on Marxism and post-Marxism and attempts to trace the controversies surrounding Marxism's enlightenment ideal of offering critique from the standpoint of higher rationality.||Manas Ray

This paper is an attempt to address this question through a linguistic analysis of some of the categories used in the context of caste, and argues that though caste existed among Muslims in traditional rural Punjab, caste labels became increasingly important only to the extent that the individual was able to acquire an identity independent of the clan or lineage to which she or he belonged.||Pervaiz Nazir

It tests this hypothesis by information on the numerical presence of women in different echelons of the power edifice and their political aspiration.

25/12/1993- ||review of agriculture, december 1993||4400590||Ground Water Overexploitation through Borehole Technology||In Karnataka state, as in many other parts of the country, well irrigation came into prominence since the 1960s. Since then rapid increase of wells and pumpsets took place. This resulted in sharp decline of water levels, which is more evident in the low rainfall, hard rock areas of the state, particularly in the four south-eastern districts of Bangalore, Chitradurga, Kolar and Tumkur. Detailed study of two small watersheds in Malur taluka of Kolar district and Davanagere taluka of Chitradurga district was conducted in February 1993 to understand the serious implications of water level decline in hard rock areas of Karnataka. Farmers tackled the problem of declining water levels by constructing bore wells, which actually triggered even more rapid decline of water levels because these structures, by virtue of their depth, are capable of yielding more water than the conventional dug wells. As a consequence, dug wells became dry and investment on them along with the pumpsets became infructuous. Thus, large number of farmers who had assured dug well irrigation a few years back are now deprived of irrigation because they did not have resources to attempt boring after the dug well became dry, or because the bore well they attempted did not prove successful. Such farmers have now switched over to dryland farming and the poorer among them are supplementing their meagre and uncertain farm income through agriculture labour.||D. S. K. Rao

05/6/1993- ||------||4399806||Calcutta Diary||These are obviously revolutionary times. Connotations of corruption and moral turpitude are undergoing a swift sea-change. The fervid debate in the Lok Sabha on the motion of impeachment of the judge adorning the nation's highest judiciary, who has given a new interpretation to the concept of carpet-bagging, bears this out.||A. M.
05/6/1993- ||special articles||4399818||Rational Expectations and Price Behaviour in India||It has been claimed that a principal proposition of the New Classical Macro-economics, namely, the neutrality of anticipated monetary growth under rational expectations, is applicable to the Indian economy. I provide evidence to refute this view. The results presented here bear a greater claim being based, as they are, upon superior modelling and more acceptable econometric practice. They suggest, among other things, that the monetary authority in India cannot be certain of containing inflation solely by implementing a pre-announced reduction in the money growth rate, leave alone being able to do so costlessly.||Pulapre Balakrishnan

N. Ghosh
11/9/1993- ||commentary||4400132||Politics of Religious Hate beyond the Bills||There are several valid reasons to examine and perhaps modify many of the provisions of the two deferred bills before enacting them into law, but to object per se to changes in the law because of a claimed preference for an undefined 'political' answer to the religious sectarian challenge is neither sound policy nor sound politics. Meanwhile, there are two important legislative changes that the government has not considered so far and which it can introduce independently of these bills.||Anil Nauriya

18/9/1993- ||commentary||4400160||A Year of Drought?||In the absence of a positive policy regarding rain water conservation, the 'natural' process of development destroys mechanisms of storage, retention and recharge. All of this is part of the phenomenon of 'drought', whether or not there is a monsoon failure.||K. Balagopal

18/12/1993- ||russia: the time of troubles||4400557||Privatisation in the Russian Federation||In exploring some of the contributory causes, mechanisms and impediments to privatisation in the Russian Federation, this paper argues that the process has been borne forward by the strength of apredominantly political calculus. By grounding the programme in the free distribution of vouchers, the government has hoped to replace conservative directors of the Soviet-era with a shareholding citizenry and thereby impart an irreversibility to the reform process as a whole. The redistribution of state property is occurring in the absence of a requisitely clear legal framework, of external controls over management by shareholders and of mature financial institutions. This has furthered a novel form of bureaucratic dominance over state industry and quasi-criminal primacy over the distributive network. Consequently, this pivotal reformist strand has gained a formal, numerical success but lacks the attributes to underpin economic transformation in the direction of genuine private management.||Arup Banerji
03/4/1993- ||commentary||4399551||CSIR and Technological Self-Reliance||Government policies on technological research and development have played little role in encouraging self-reliance. There is an urgent need to take corrective action so that the efforts and capabilities of institutions such as the CSIR can be harnessed towards achieving this end.||S. R. Valluri
