The paper examines the case of Tungabhadra sub-basin in south India and finds that it has made little progress in practical terms with regard to intra- and inter-sectoral allocation of water. The concept of IWRM in Tungabhadra is relatively new and water management has been performed mainly at the state level. As a result, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have their own set of different water governance regimes — water policies, laws and legislations, institutions and practices — with relatively little interaction between them.||S MANASI,INGRID NESHEIM,K J JOY,SUHAS PARANJAPE,K V RAJU,NAGOTHU UDAYA SEKHAR

The Indian economy will enter the Twelfth Plan period in an environment of great promise, but the next five years will also be a period of major challenges. The economy has done well on the growth front during the Eleventh Plan, but, going by the information that is at least currently available, not so well on inclusion. Much of what needs to be done to accelerate gdp growth during the Twelfth Plan will be done by the private sector, but the central and state governments have a crucial role to play in providing a policy environment that is seen as investor-friendly and is supportive of inclusive growth. Four critical challenges facing the economy in the Twelfth Plan, which are perhaps more serious than they were at the start of the Eleventh Plan, are those of (a) managing the energy situation, (b) managing the water economy, (c) addressing the problems posed by the urban transformation that is likely to occur, and (d) ensuring protection of the environment in a manner that can facilitate rapid growth. In addition, the efficiency in implementation of projects on the ground needs to be greatly improved.||MONTEK S AHLUWALIA

It undermines the foundational position of forests, prepares them to become a playground for profits and minimally serves the interests of the marginalised tribal and forest dwellers. The paper describes the basic features of labour teleology and the notion of foundational position in its historical context. It then proceeds to describe the historical process of labour teleology in India and its impact on the forest. It locates FRA 2006 in the development of capitalism and goes on to show that by destroying the foundational position of forests, this Act turns forests into an ecological service provider for capitalism.||SAVYASAACHI

This paper explores the social, political and environmental implications of not counting girls as household members and drinkers of water. It tries to find answers to the following questions: What are the implications of girls' non-payment for the cost of drinking water in a shared system? What might girls' non-payment mean in terms of the gendered sustainability goals of the project? What are the implications for women's and girls' political subjectivity, especially where natural resources are concerned? The paper also addresses a gap in the political ecology literature with respect to the gender dimensions of neo-liberal processes in the water sector by suggesting a variety of impacts when girls are excluded from water payment.||KATHLEEN O'REILLY

The decision raises serious questions of economics, politics and the subregional development strategy. For Bangladesh, the key question is no longer whether it should allow transit rights to Indian goods but what is in its best strategic interests. This can only be done after a suitable assessment of the economic and broader strategic issues. At the purely economic level, the most important questions relate to the (a) demand for transit; (b) most suitable modes of transport; (c) time and cost savings, and the benefit sharing between India and Bangladesh. At the strategic level, it is important to understand the deeper concerns of India, the north-eastern states and Bangladesh that have a bearing on the transit debate. There are a number of bilateral issues of national importance that remain unresolved, including watersharing, marine boundary demarcation and insecure borders. Bangladesh has to therefore evaluate its response to the Indian demand for transit based on both economic and strategic considerations. This study is an attempt to combine both kinds of perspectives in order to define Bangladesh's policy response in the wake of the 2010 agreement.||K A S MURSHID

Forest rights implementation has been sluggish with rampant violations and large-scale denial of rights, mostly by the forest bureaucracy, the revenue and tribal departments. An analysis of the legal provisions under various Acts reveals that none of the 39 notified Critical Tiger Habitats have obtained the consent of the forest dwellers and the gram sabhas, and are thus illegal. An elitist conservation policy, which has so far targeted only the tribals, has resulted in illegal encroachment and activities in the tiger reserves by the State.||C R BIJOY

However, a complex entwining of caste and gender has consistently defined water allocation and access among users and entrenched fractures in the structure and culture of the policy-implementing and regulatory institutions. Contrary to popular assumptions, both official welfare-based supply and recent neo-liberal policies and interventions hinge on a tokenistic, segregated and apolitical mention of gender and/or caste concerns which, when translated into action, have often reinforced existing inequities. Based on the above observations, this paper argues that subsequent changes in domestic water policies have only served to exacerbate an enduring unequal social order around water in India.||DEEPA JOSHI

It delineates how the riverbed has changed from being a neglected "non-place" to prized real estate for private and public corporations. It argues that the transformation of an urban commons into a commodity is not only embedded in processes of political economy, but is also driven by aesthetic sensibilities that shape how ecological landscapes are valued. However, the commodification of the riverbed must confront the fact that the Yamuna is an ecological entity with dynamics that can defy attempts at domestication.||AMITA BAVISKAR

In light of the recent debates surrounding the formulation of ecotourism guidelines for tiger reserves, this article undertakes a critical analysis of some of the ecotourism policies and programmes of the Indian government so far. It evaluates the ecotourism discourse specifically within the paradigm of sustainable development, which forms its legitimising base. The fragmented nature of ecotourism policies and practices and the resultant trade-offs unearthed, are then traced back to the contradictions and vagueness inherent in the very conceptualisation of ecotourism as a tool of sustainable development. This shows that revisions in guidelines, without a critical evaluation of the underlying conceptual basis, will not sufficiently address all the lacunae entailed.||SUCHISMITA DAS

This empirical analysis signifies the concerns for the livelihoods of farmers, when the cost of depletion is disproportionately borne by the resource-poor farmers as they are unable to invest in capital and technology and are hence denied the benefits of groundwater irrigation that is subsidised by free electricity. This situation is perpetuated with further scarcity leading to unequal economic returns and, finally, takes the most exploitative form where the "large landlords" also emerge as "water lords" through surplus accumulation, forcing the small and marginal landholders to become landless agricultural labourers.||ANINDITA SARKAR

This meant that analyses shifted away from labour, production relations and surplus value extraction typically grounded in Marxian modes of analysis, in favour of those focused on environmental sustainability, livelihood sustainability and a discourse on poverty. During this period, women's labour has been mobilised at an unprecedented scale and concentrated in the most exploitative jobs to fuel economic growth in fisheries. Even as industrial fisheries thrive on the labour of poor women, new analyses and new forms of organising are needed to fundamentally challenge this exploitation. Capital cannot be left unfettered to do as it pleases, but must be forced through stringent regulation to heed other considerations apart from profitability alone. Donor aid is, however, driving the non-governmental organisation increasingly towards conciliatory, mediatory roles, incapable of seeking solutions outside the framework of capital.||NILANJANA BISWAS

While the policy initiative of introducing quotas for women in public bodies is welcome and necessary, it is certainly not sufficient for the success of decentralisation in a society ridden with discrimination based on class, caste and patriarchy, and where the culture of political patronage is dominant. The presence of vibrant social and political movements that propose alternative cultural, social and political paradigms would be a necessary foundation for major social changes. The success of decentralised water governance is constrained by the conceptualisation of the larger reform in water at one level and the notions of the normative woman, community, public and the private domains, and institutions at another. Unless all of these are altered, decentralised processes will not be truly democratic.||SEEMA KULKARNI

Using data on human casualties and damages suffered by the houses as dependent variables, and different meteorological, geophysical and socio-economic factors as independent variables, this study estimates a cyclone damage function to bring out the mitigating effects of the mangrove vegetation. The results show that mangroves did significantly reduce the occurrence of human deaths and the extent of damage to residential houses.

The content analysis of 968 news items shows that 36% of the coverage goes to issues of violence, accidents, crime or disasters. Less than 28% is about agrarian themes while 15% is about hunger, suicides, malnutrition, distress migration, displacement, or farmers' movements.

Strategies to respond to groundwater overuse and deteriorating water quality must be based on a new approach involving typologising the resource problems and redefining the institutional structure governing groundwater. This approach is based on the notion of groundwater as common property. The complex nature of groundwater problems in India implies that a detailed understanding of regimes in different hydrogeological settings and socio-economic situations is the prerequisite for sustainable and equitable management. Further, the management strategies should be specified keeping aquifer-scales in mind. For the adoption of this new approach, reforms are needed in how we assess groundwater resources, map aquifers, monitor quality and in the legal and institutional framework for groundwater governance. A national programme of groundwater management based on this process-specific approach is needed to address the challenge.||P S VIJAY SHANKAR,HIMANSHU KULKARNI,SUNDERRAJAN KRISHNAN

This also led to a change in the perceptions of the local people in the context of conservation of forests and wildlife as it created socio-economic and cultural vulnerabilities. This paper examines the causal factors which influence the changing perceptions of the local people towards state-created national park areas. The main aim of the study is to identify the significance of non-wood forest products for forest dependent people living in rural ecosystem spaces. The case study here is of Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh.||ANANYA MUKHERJEE

However, the overall impression is that they are capital-intensive and suited to large farms. In this context, a study was undertaken in nine states, mainly to examine the actual area covered compared to the potential area and to understand the adoption level of MI as well as to analyse the cost and returns under different farm categories. The results indicated that only about 9% of the MI potential is covered in the country. Key suggestions include reduction in capital cost of the system, provision of technical support for operation after installation, relaxation of farm size limitation in providing subsidies and the establishment of a single state level agency for implementation of the programme.||K PALANISAMI,KADIRI MOHAN,K R KAKUMANU,S RAMAN

However, since methodological details of the wii surveys are not available in the public domain, a technical assessment of the reliability of these survey results is not possible.||K ULLAS KARANTH

Many issues are much more than what they seem because they symbolise many other viewpoints. Water disputes in the region are a typical example of the scarcity dilemma acquiring the overtones of a security dilemma. However dire the mutual needs of nations that face a water crisis, they are also caught in a vortex of geopolitical forces. The only way out of this "us" versus "them" circle is evolving a knowledge system on water resources that is interdisciplinary and one that dispenses with the colonial engineering models of development.||NARENDRA KUMAR TRIPATHI

Investigating strategies of being and belonging deployed by the urban poor in the Delhi basti of Nangla Matchi, which was demolished in 2006, this paper explores three varied individual biographies as sites of meanings regarding processes of the state, the unstable contexts of livelihoods, and histories of intra-national displacement. The paper also seeks to make an ethnographic contribution to studies of the urban margins by examining the overlapping careers of "margin" and "centre" as cultural, political and economic contexts. The life-stories described in this paper thus concern the ways in which the metropolises of power, comfort, pleasure, and hygiene are built over and through the provinces of powerlessness, pain, suffering and displacement.||SANJAY SRIVASTAVA

But this package of laws is incomplete without a fundamental right to participate in decisions relating to development, welfare, and conservation. Such a right, and concomitant responsibilities, should be enshrined in the Constitution, and be enforceable through one or more laws.||ASHISH KOTHARI

Key programmes implemented in 20 villages during 2009 were studied using rapid scientific assessment methods. An indicator approach was adopted to analyse environmental services such as water for irrigation and improvement in soil quality. The status of environmental services before and after implementation of the activities was examined and vulnerability indices were constructed and compared. The activities were found to have reduced the vulnerability of agricultural production, water resources and livelihoods to uncertain rainfall, water scarcity and poor soil fertility.||RAKESH TIWARI,H I SOMASHEKHAR,V R RAMAKRISHNA PARAMA,INDU K MURTHY,M S MOHAN KUMAR,B K MOHAN KUMAR,HARSHAD PARATE,MURARI VARMA,SUMEDHA MALAVIYA,ANANYA S RAO,ASMITA SENGUPTA,RUTH KATTUMURI,N H RAVINDRANATH

A scrutiny of the methodology of the report suggests an overvaluation of social benefits and undervaluation of social costs. The report also deviates from received practices in environmental valuation of forest benefits. Its conclusions therefore are inaccurate and state policy must be cautious while allowing activities that may cause irreversible damages to Goa's natural wealth.||PRANAB MUKHOPADHYAY,GOPAL K KADEKODI

There are a number of scholars and activists who tend to valorise premodern wisdoms without critically evaluating their sociocultural context and realising how deeply they were embedded in the social hierarchy of their times. There has been, of course, a great deal of stress lately on a kind of"eco-golden age". This is clearly a case of an "anachronistic projection of modern phenomenon on to the screen of tradition". Seen from such a perspective, all pre-industrial societies would exhibit a kind of harmony with nature. However, most of the times, it was the demographic and technological factors that made these societies less harmful to the environment. It was not that they wished to protect the whole canopy of nature. This reappraisal demonstrates how precepts and rites, culture and customary practices and state policy interact to lay the bases of water harvesting traditions. Social customs are the necessary conditions for sustaining these traditions, while local autonomy in resource management is the critical sufficient condition but it never results in equitable access for all.||SHRI KRISHAN
