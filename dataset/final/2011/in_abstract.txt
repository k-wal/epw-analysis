It undermines the foundational position of forests, prepares them to become a playground for profits and minimally serves the interests of the marginalised tribal and forest dwellers. The paper describes the basic features of labour teleology and the notion of foundational position in its historical context. It then proceeds to describe the historical process of labour teleology in India and its impact on the forest. It locates FRA 2006 in the development of capitalism and goes on to show that by destroying the foundational position of forests, this Act turns forests into an ecological service provider for capitalism.||SAVYASAACHI

Even as competing lobbies continue to push for the de-notification of its status as an ecologically fragile region and removal of the Dahanu Authority the environmentalists walk a tight rope attempting to protect the natural resource base of the region.||MICHELLE CHAWLA,GEENTANJOY SAHU

This paper explores the social, political and environmental implications of not counting girls as household members and drinkers of water. It tries to find answers to the following questions: What are the implications of girls' non-payment for the cost of drinking water in a shared system? What might girls' non-payment mean in terms of the gendered sustainability goals of the project? What are the implications for women's and girls' political subjectivity, especially where natural resources are concerned? The paper also addresses a gap in the political ecology literature with respect to the gender dimensions of neo-liberal processes in the water sector by suggesting a variety of impacts when girls are excluded from water payment.||KATHLEEN O'REILLY

We also need to understand how to increase and sustain the capability of people, economies and nature to deal with change. And for this, science, policy and practice need to fashion modes of working together. They are themselves three components of a structure that can help us to move forward in a sustainable and dynamic manner. The argument here is that a systems approach using some notions from resilience theory will provide pointers towards how this can happen.||KANCHAN CHOPRA

Neither the Uttar Pradesh nor the Madhya Pradesh government has made efforts to address the basic issues of ecological degradation, agricultural modernisation and rural indebtedness. The demand for a separate state only serves to satisfy political ends and is no solution for the multiple problems of Bundelkhand's farmers.||A K VERMA

The reports do not preach to the committed environmentalist who already values nature. They are geared instead to the sceptical public administrator and to the practical businessperson, aiming to make these actors realise - by means of convincing examples - that economics should go beyond its existing boundaries.||PUSHPAM KUMAR,JOAN MARTINEZ-ALIER

At a point of time when a natural seismic occurrence has shaken the stability of an already unpredictable Himalayan ecosystem, it is important to revisit the concept of hydropower projects as a green, clean and safe option.||KANCHI KOHLI

The United Nations is best placed to support a common understanding on patterns of resource use that are in principle common for all by generating strategic knowledge, also leading to deepening coherence of the global agenda.||MUKUL SANWAL

However, the prior consultations on the notification have led to a higher level of awareness about coastal issues among the fishing communities, government officials and the general public, all auguring well for its enforcement.||CHANDRIKA SHARMA

It delineates how the riverbed has changed from being a neglected "non-place" to prized real estate for private and public corporations. It argues that the transformation of an urban commons into a commodity is not only embedded in processes of political economy, but is also driven by aesthetic sensibilities that shape how ecological landscapes are valued. However, the commodification of the riverbed must confront the fact that the Yamuna is an ecological entity with dynamics that can defy attempts at domestication.||AMITA BAVISKAR

In light of the recent debates surrounding the formulation of ecotourism guidelines for tiger reserves, this article undertakes a critical analysis of some of the ecotourism policies and programmes of the Indian government so far. It evaluates the ecotourism discourse specifically within the paradigm of sustainable development, which forms its legitimising base. The fragmented nature of ecotourism policies and practices and the resultant trade-offs unearthed, are then traced back to the contradictions and vagueness inherent in the very conceptualisation of ecotourism as a tool of sustainable development. This shows that revisions in guidelines, without a critical evaluation of the underlying conceptual basis, will not sufficiently address all the lacunae entailed.||SUCHISMITA DAS

This empirical analysis signifies the concerns for the livelihoods of farmers, when the cost of depletion is disproportionately borne by the resource-poor farmers as they are unable to invest in capital and technology and are hence denied the benefits of groundwater irrigation that is subsidised by free electricity. This situation is perpetuated with further scarcity leading to unequal economic returns and, finally, takes the most exploitative form where the "large landlords" also emerge as "water lords" through surplus accumulation, forcing the small and marginal landholders to become landless agricultural labourers.||ANINDITA SARKAR

The geographic distribution of this expansion is highly uneven, showing clustering in certain coal-mining states, and further within districts and regions. By backing independent power producers through comprehensive memoranda of understanding, state governments have forsaken the communities that will bear the environmental, health and livelihood impact of these thermal clusters.||KANNAN KASTURI

This meant that analyses shifted away from labour, production relations and surplus value extraction typically grounded in Marxian modes of analysis, in favour of those focused on environmental sustainability, livelihood sustainability and a discourse on poverty. During this period, women's labour has been mobilised at an unprecedented scale and concentrated in the most exploitative jobs to fuel economic growth in fisheries. Even as industrial fisheries thrive on the labour of poor women, new analyses and new forms of organising are needed to fundamentally challenge this exploitation. Capital cannot be left unfettered to do as it pleases, but must be forced through stringent regulation to heed other considerations apart from profitability alone. Donor aid is, however, driving the non-governmental organisation increasingly towards conciliatory, mediatory roles, incapable of seeking solutions outside the framework of capital.||NILANJANA BISWAS
9/4/2011-15/4/2011||notes||41152321||Saffronisation of the Holy Cow: Unearthing Silent Communalism||The principles of environmentality are employed in this study to look at how law, science and policy can mould environmental subjectivities of people to conflicting ends. The study locates the environment and animalrights debate within the complex of underlying exclusivist Hindu nationalist philosophy. This case study of Karnataka Prevention of Slaughter and Protection of Cattle Bill 2010, which is considered a direct attack on the dietary practices of the minorities, is an extension of the critiques of religious-environmentalism and showcases the machinations of a fundamentalist metanarrative that obscures environmental thought. This silent form of communalism tends to go unnoticed when couched in scientific or politically correct language.||SMITHA RAO

They are expected to generate a continuous flow of environmental services in the long run, along with maintaining their quality. This essay elucidates the conditions required for the successful implementation of PES schemes and considers how well they may do in the Indian context. It foresees a number of formidable challenges in the schemes producing the desired outcomes in India.||BHAGIRATH BEHERA,PULAK MISHRA,NARAYAN C NAYAK

Yet, a perusal of the proposal suggests that it has a number of limitations and therefore has to be rejected.

Key programmes implemented in 20 villages during 2009 were studied using rapid scientific assessment methods. An indicator approach was adopted to analyse environmental services such as water for irrigation and improvement in soil quality. The status of environmental services before and after implementation of the activities was examined and vulnerability indices were constructed and compared. The activities were found to have reduced the vulnerability of agricultural production, water resources and livelihoods to uncertain rainfall, water scarcity and poor soil fertility.||RAKESH TIWARI,H I SOMASHEKHAR,V R RAMAKRISHNA PARAMA,INDU K MURTHY,M S MOHAN KUMAR,B K MOHAN KUMAR,HARSHAD PARATE,MURARI VARMA,SUMEDHA MALAVIYA,ANANYA S RAO,ASMITA SENGUPTA,RUTH KATTUMURI,N H RAVINDRANATH

A scrutiny of the methodology of the report suggests an overvaluation of social benefits and undervaluation of social costs. The report also deviates from received practices in environmental valuation of forest benefits. Its conclusions therefore are inaccurate and state policy must be cautious while allowing activities that may cause irreversible damages to Goa's natural wealth.||PRANAB MUKHOPADHYAY,GOPAL K KADEKODI
25/6/2011-8/7/2011||------||23018815||Water Harvesting Traditions and the Social Milieu in India: A Second Look||India has a variety of local community traditions of water harvesting. There are a number of scholars and activists who tend to valorise premodern wisdoms without critically evaluating their sociocultural context and realising how deeply they were embedded in the social hierarchy of their times. There has been, of course, a great deal of stress lately on a kind of"eco-golden age". This is clearly a case of an "anachronistic projection of modern phenomenon on to the screen of tradition". Seen from such a perspective, all pre-industrial societies would exhibit a kind of harmony with nature. However, most of the times, it was the demographic and technological factors that made these societies less harmful to the environment. It was not that they wished to protect the whole canopy of nature. This reappraisal demonstrates how precepts and rites, culture and customary practices and state policy interact to lay the bases of water harvesting traditions. Social customs are the necessary conditions for sustaining these traditions, while local autonomy in resource management is the critical sufficient condition but it never results in equitable access for all.||SHRI KRISHAN
