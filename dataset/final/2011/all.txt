This trend reached a new high when the apex court recently "ordered" the central government to distribute foodgrains, found rotting for want of storage facilities, to the poor and hungry. The prime minister had to intervene to make it clear that the court was stepping into the domain of policymaking, an area meant for the executive.||ANURAG K AGARWAL

There has been a neglect of state institutions and decisions by the executive are taken not under consultation with the assembly but as decreed by a new religious math-temple-resort complex that has come to wield power and influence. Democratic processes have been sidelined and people's movements have been corrupted. The uneven growth of the state economy that has accompanied these processes holds out the danger of Karnataka becoming a land of deep inhumanity.||A R VASAVI

It would appear at first sight that one can rely entirely on common sense to carry it out. But that would be a mistaken notion. While inflation policy does require judgment and intuition, it is essential that these be backed up with statistical information and an understanding of economic theory. This paper tries to bring together the formal analytics that underlie inflation policy. It surveys some of the standard ideas and also questions some of them and, in the process, tries to push outwards the frontiers of our understanding.||KAUSHIK BASU

The Indian Evidence||Notwithstanding the wide recognition that movements in relative prices and inequality affect welfare comparisons between households, there is a dearth of literature incorporating them in welfare analysis. Changes in relative prices open up a divergence between nominal and real expenditure inequalities that will persist even if all nominal expenditures are deflated by a household invariant price index. In a period of rising inequality, a comparison of summary welfare measures based on mean or median expenditure, even if inflation adjusted, will give us a misleading picture of changes in living standards. This paper provides evidence for India in the post-reform period. The results confirm that in a period of significant relative price changes and rising inequality, the omission of these factors leads to overstatement of the welfare gains. Another observation is that relatively affluent states do not do all that well if we focus on inequality or on their food consumption alone.||ANKITA MISHRA,RANJAN RAY

This paper endeavours to provide empirical evidence to this question based on five case studies: three compulsory mergers and two voluntary mergers of recent origin. An index of stock success and an index of flow success assess the performance impact on the balance sheets and income of these banks. There is evidence that one of the transferee banks associated with a compulsory merger appears to have registered underperformance after the event, though there are incipient signs of turnaround in the recent period. Merger was a performance booster for the other transferee banks. Based on these findings, the paper concludes that the approach adopted by the Reserve Bank of India delivered value to the banking sector.||PRASHANT SARAN,TULASI GOPINATH

It extends Giorgio Agamben's formulation of the "permanent state of exception" to examine how member states of supranational organisations partially delegate their own capacity to declare health emergencies of varying scale and scope. It goes on to ask whether the structures of consciousness about the dangers of global disease and utility of promised disease control that was embedded in the will to expansion of classic empires have now been transformed into a new mechanism of control on behalf of a different type of translocal force.||CINDY PATTON

In discussing the conflicting interests of local politics and urban development, this article places the definition and understanding of what is "urban" in the context of the 74th constitutional amendment, and also looks at the expectations from and the progress on the reforms agenda of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission. Further, the article addresses the high economic stakes and challenges involved in metro governance, while arguing that these cannot be dealt with under the general rubric of Union-State-Municipality. International experience is relevant in this regard not for the structural models followed, but because unlike in India, the subject of urban governance in most cities around the world has been a matter of serious debate and action.||K C SIVARAMAKRISHNAN

On the other hand, the text put out by the Anna Hazare team meets in substantial measure the requirements necessary for a body that can effectively tackle corruption in high places. However, while the government bill is on the spot in seeking to cover only corruption at the top, the Hazare text loses focus by attempting to deal with too many things – bribery, maladministration and misconduct. Where the NGO bill gets it right is in outlining the processes, powers and jurisdiction of the Lokpal. It should now be possible to work towards establishing a constitutionally valid, efficient, workable and sustainable legal mechanism to combat corruption.||SRIRAM PANCHU

The media is a significant source of information: out of 27 meetings in which villagers speak up, the media is cited in nine. But the "thinness" of information on entitlements in the media makes it easy for gram panchayat members to refute legitimate claims. The information deficit in the public sphere, arising from media apathy and political collusion, translates into inability of the poor to assess local governments. While the role of the media in strengthening the functioning of electoral democracy is acknowledged, media indifference to deliberative democracy limits poor people's capacity to translate immediate demands for goods and services to aspirations for a good life.||SWATI BHATTACHARJEE,RAGHABENDRA CHATTOPADHYAY

Though the film deals with similar issues of crime, corruption in police and politics, and rural poverty as its predecessors, it adopts a different attitude. While acknowledging corruption in the institutions of the State, it still treats it with much greater respect and depicts politics as a space in which hope still exists.||M K RAGHAVENDRA

The paper examines the case of Tungabhadra sub-basin in south India and finds that it has made little progress in practical terms with regard to intra- and inter-sectoral allocation of water. The concept of IWRM in Tungabhadra is relatively new and water management has been performed mainly at the state level. As a result, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh have their own set of different water governance regimes — water policies, laws and legislations, institutions and practices — with relatively little interaction between them.||S MANASI,INGRID NESHEIM,K J JOY,SUHAS PARANJAPE,K V RAJU,NAGOTHU UDAYA SEKHAR

Today the term -rooted in obligation and reciprocity -is used throughout India by scholars, media personnel and political parties to refer to the exchange of benefits and favours to citizens in return for their political support. Vote banks in Karnataka are reviewed for similarities and differences between the 1955 definition and modern operations in Indian electoral politics. While the structure of vote banks remains largely unaltered, three changes in Indian politics have shaped the meaning of obligation and reciprocity in modern vote banks: the rise of party competition, changes in identity politics, and economic growth and reform.||MARY E BREEDING

Its principal defect is that it attaches an arbitrary mark-up to the historical market price to determine compensation amounts. This will guarantee neither social justice nor the efficient use of resources. The Bill also places unnecessary and severe conditions on land acquisition, such as restrictions on the use of multicropped land and insistence on public purpose, all of which are going to stifle the pace of development without promoting the interests of farmers. We present an alternative approach that will allow farmers to choose compensation in either land or cash, determine their own price instead of leaving it to the government's discretion, and also reallocate the remaining farmland in the most efficient manner. Our proposed method involves a land auction covering not only the project site but also the surrounding agricultural land.||MAITREESH GHATAK,PARIKSHIT GHOSH
12/11/2011- ||special articles||41319408||Regulatory Freedom under GATS: Financial Services Sector||The 2008 financial crisis and the rescue of big firms, costing trillions of dollars to taxpayers, has created a strong global push for the restructuring and re-regulating of big banks and financial firms. This has produced two reactions: on the one side, heavy lobbying by banking and financial firms to block reforms and weaken enforcement. On the other side, a campaign by some northern NGOS, one or two members of the World Trade Organisation, and the latest by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, about the General Agreement on Trade in Services posing impediments for reform and the need for rule changes to overcome them. This paper finds the campaign to change GATS misguided and meritless. The GATS provides near-total freedom to regulate the financial services sector for prudential reasons and to ensure the integrity and stability of the financial system. The changes being proposed will be against developing country interests, mess up the GATS and impact its integrity as a viable trade agreement.||B K ZUTSHI

Indian small and medium enterprises in food and other agriculture-related products, some intermediate goods, and light manufacturing products are also likely to suffer. But import liberalisation in intermediate goods will encourage multinational corporations to undertake production rationalisation across the region in the transport equipment, machinery, chemicals and iron and steel sectors. This could lead to India's deeper integration in production networks in such sectors. All this, combined with the neglect of the development needs of domestic agriculture and a manufacturing base for the expected gains in service sector liberalisation with ASEAN, is likely to make India's employment and livelihood issues even more challenging.||SMITHA FRANCIS

Farmers and other landholders are unwilling to relinquish their means of production to capitalists. This has led to a proliferation of pitched battles across India against all kinds of land acquisition. The Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill (2009) and Resettlement and Rehabilitation Bill (2009) therefore need to be examined carefully. The proposed amendments to the Land Acquisition Act will only facilitate the State's new role as the land broker-in-chief. The Resettlement and Rehabilitation Bill will help the Land Acquisition Bill in "rationalising" dispossession by ensuring a more secure and predictable corporate access to land.||MICHAEL LEVIEN

This paper attempts to examine the degree of empowerment and autonomy across different characteristics like place of residence, religion, caste, education, type of employment and wealth quintiles at the individual as well as the regional levels.

This path was neither a full continuation of the colonial modern nor a restoration of the feudal-traditional. Drawing on progressive ideas from India's "renaissance" and freedom struggle within the Indian "renaissance" and nationalism, this education policy was meant to unleash the potential of India's civilisation by a process of intellectual decolonisation. Unfortunately, in the past few decades, this unfinished agenda has been dumped by successive governments.

Missing in the frenzy was any effort to arrive at an understanding of what "corruption" meant to the people joining the protest. Also lacking was a sense of tolerance for alternative views on a complex social phenomenon. Far from reflecting the complex and multilayered anxieties that underpin the growing popular restiveness with governance processes, the media chose to present a singular authoritarian point of view as the true and authentic voice of all Indians.

Financialisation is an important factor among the recent trends. There is strong evidence of correlation among the markets for different financial assets, including stocks/shares, commodities and currencies. Falling asset prices in other financial market segments may thus be more important for explaining the recent surge in food prices than supply constraints or changing demand and other factors underlying longer-term gradual upward price trends.||JOMO KWAME SUNDARAM

Literacy rates have increased sharply between 2001 and 2011; some of the low performing rates have shown strong improvements, the others have not. The dismal picture in the 2011 Census is that even as the overall sex ratio has improved due to better adult female mortality, that of the child sex ratio has further deteriorated. High mortality among girl children and sex selective abortions have pushed the child sex ratio down in all but three states.||K NAVANEETHAM,A DHARMALINGAM

It was passive resistance, which is always "a preparation for active armed resistance". The violence which had lain repressed had erupted on the eve of Independence. Gandhi's insight seems to have left academic wisdom and popular memory unaffected. This study of two "twin" fasts by Gandhi is part of a larger attempt to use that insight to make sense of his 30-odd years in India and of his undying faith in non-violence.

There are differing opinions on the factor proportions in its exports. Some argue that exports continue to be labour-intensive, while others have found a reallocation in favour of more skill-based and sophisticated exports. This paper is an attempt to address the ongoing debate. The study finds that post-2001 China's exports have diversified. The major finding is that, based on the competitiveness analysis, the share of hi-tech manufactures has increased, while the share of unskilled labour-intensive products has gone down during 2001-06. Post-2001 hi-tech products command a share of 32% in China's total exports and 43% in China's total imports. This is indicative of the fact that imports of hi-tech parts and components are assembled in China to be exported as finished hi-tech goods.||GEETHANJALI NATARAJ,ANJALI TANDON

As conceived, the transformatory potential of NREGA is limited.

It begins with the origins of discrimination in historical perspective, and explains how discrimination leads to exclusion, to show that embedded injustice is an outcome of the process. The conception of justice evolved over a long period of time that spanned centuries if not millennia. Yet, it is clear that the quest for social justice, driven by political democracy mostly through affirmative action, essentially surfaced during the second half of the 20th century. This leads into a discussion on the logic, the necessity and the limitations of affirmative action to highlight what else is needed. And a dose of reality is imparted to the story with a tale of three countries, even if the focus is on India. In conclusion, the paper draws some lessons from experience to contemplate the future.||DEEPAK NAYYAR

The Indian economy will enter the Twelfth Plan period in an environment of great promise, but the next five years will also be a period of major challenges. The economy has done well on the growth front during the Eleventh Plan, but, going by the information that is at least currently available, not so well on inclusion. Much of what needs to be done to accelerate gdp growth during the Twelfth Plan will be done by the private sector, but the central and state governments have a crucial role to play in providing a policy environment that is seen as investor-friendly and is supportive of inclusive growth. Four critical challenges facing the economy in the Twelfth Plan, which are perhaps more serious than they were at the start of the Eleventh Plan, are those of (a) managing the energy situation, (b) managing the water economy, (c) addressing the problems posed by the urban transformation that is likely to occur, and (d) ensuring protection of the environment in a manner that can facilitate rapid growth. In addition, the efficiency in implementation of projects on the ground needs to be greatly improved.||MONTEK S AHLUWALIA

This phenomenon of constituting and naming social formations and the misrecognitions it gives rise to are most instructive in a discussion of the urban commons. This paper analyses Eenadu, a 1982 Telugu film that is centrally concerned with crowds, to illustrate how cinema brings the mass gathered before the screen face-to-face with a version of itself on the screen, framing a new mode of political participation pivoted on the popular appeal of larger-than-life superstars.||S V SRINIVAS

Judicial reasoning tends to accord an inordinate degree of importance to an absolutist reading of the "sanctity of life" principle. But this tenet has already been compromised to such an extent as to render its continued influence tenuous at best. Moreover, the ethical and jurisprudential foundation for extending the right to die to encompass assisted suicide or active euthanasia in controlled circumstances already exists in the present framework. However, patients incapable of ending their lives are unjustly pre-empted from availing of the right to die in its plenary form.||SUSHILA RAO

While public policy has shown some response to this phenomenon, there is scope for improvement of the coverage of the programmes. Health insurance schemes like the Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana cover only conditional hospitalisation expenses. This paper argues that treatment cost incurred on ailments not requiring hospitalisation is also a substantial burden on the urban poor. Based on a case study of 150 slum households in south Delhi with a history of treated ailments within a specific recall period, the study estimates the degree and distribution of this burden across socio-economic and disease characteristics in the sample. The paper argues for a more holistic approach in social safety nets like the RSBY, and for explicitly including uncovered healthcare payments in measurement of the poverty lines for a more accurate estimation of the marginalised.||SAMIK CHOWDHURY

It totally ignores the patient's interests and turns on the legal concept of "next friend". This concept is in the context of a person who is unable to maintain a suit on her own behalf due to disability and is akin to a "guardian" legally representing a "minor". The Court considered the nursing staff to be Shanbaug's "next friend". The total denial of recognition of the right to autonomy and self-determination of a person incompetent to consent, and the usurpation by guardians or the State of determining the best interests of the patient is a hazardous course of action.||RAKESH SHUKLA

These aggregate trends are used to infer: (a) the dominant relations of production under which the vast majority of the Indian working people labour, and (b) the predominant ways in which the surplus labour of the direct producers is appropriated by the dominant classes. This summary account is meant to inform and link up with ongoing attempts at radically restructuring Indian society. Part I, published this week, covers agriculture, while Part II, to be published next week, inquires into the "informal" industrial sector.||AMIT BASOLE,DEEPANKAR BASU

This paper explores the social, political and environmental implications of not counting girls as household members and drinkers of water. It tries to find answers to the following questions: What are the implications of girls' non-payment for the cost of drinking water in a shared system? What might girls' non-payment mean in terms of the gendered sustainability goals of the project? What are the implications for women's and girls' political subjectivity, especially where natural resources are concerned? The paper also addresses a gap in the political ecology literature with respect to the gender dimensions of neo-liberal processes in the water sector by suggesting a variety of impacts when girls are excluded from water payment.||KATHLEEN O'REILLY

The labour share in value added of India's organised manufacturing sector has been on a downward trend, from 0.6 in 1980 to 0.26 in 2007. The study also finds that real wages have increased minimally during the period analysed — well below labour productivity — while the real profit rate and unit capital costs have increased substantially. The analysis questions policy recommendations that advocate wage moderation, which result from simply looking at the evolution of the ULC, and that blame the loss of competitiveness on high or increasing wages.||UTSAV KUMAR,JESUS FELIPE

The riots have to be located against the backdrop of the socio-economic changes that London has undergone during the last few decades.

The imperial imaginations of the medieval Arab dynasties, the colonial British, and now the United States have been dominated by this anxiety. We have to plant our historiographical feet in the frontier space of present-day Afghanistan, Pakistan and north India to see the concerns which emerge from within a regional imagination, in a regionally specific conversation and in regional stories. Situating ourselves in the frontier reveals varied perspectives that are invisible to the imperial eye. To pay attention to the localised production of history and memory is to decontextualise the only context that appears relevant -the imperial one. This shift in perspective reveals that the oft-designated "frontier" has a centrality all of its own.||MANAN AHMED

The decision raises serious questions of economics, politics and the subregional development strategy. For Bangladesh, the key question is no longer whether it should allow transit rights to Indian goods but what is in its best strategic interests. This can only be done after a suitable assessment of the economic and broader strategic issues. At the purely economic level, the most important questions relate to the (a) demand for transit; (b) most suitable modes of transport; (c) time and cost savings, and the benefit sharing between India and Bangladesh. At the strategic level, it is important to understand the deeper concerns of India, the north-eastern states and Bangladesh that have a bearing on the transit debate. There are a number of bilateral issues of national importance that remain unresolved, including watersharing, marine boundary demarcation and insecure borders. Bangladesh has to therefore evaluate its response to the Indian demand for transit based on both economic and strategic considerations. This study is an attempt to combine both kinds of perspectives in order to define Bangladesh's policy response in the wake of the 2010 agreement.||K A S MURSHID

These concerns are the relationship between faith and modernity and that between revelation, plurality of beliefs and culture which have led toa number of political positions. This paper highlights the features of six influential positions through the writings of one significant thinker from each tradition. Every one of these thinkers responded differently to two overarching concerns. They either engaged with the philosophical principles of modernity, or thought that modernity as a set of skills could be grafted onto the foundational principles of Islam or that a different world could be created by picking out the principles ingrained in the Islamic tradition.||VALERIAN RODRIGUES

This suggests that capital inflow actually crowded out domestic investment, thereby generating a surplus of domestic saving in recipient countries. This paper seeks to explain why such crowding-out might occur. A simple open-economy model is developed to show that crowding-out can be seen as an unavoidable consequence of substantial capital inflow, and that growth of foreign currency reserves is a corollary of crowding-out. The implication is that by allowing unrestricted inflow of foreign private capital, developing countries do not augment investment. They end up undermining their domestic investors, lending their own savings to developed countries and increasing their dependence on foreign investors for sustaining economic growth. Maintaining controls on capital flows is a good policy stance.||AJIT K GHOSE

Failure to implement these laws is one of the major problems confronting the prevention of communal violence.

Middle-class students who are backed by certain cultural capital fare relatively better. Cultural capital informs the relationship between schooling and the family/social structure and also shapes the teacher's role in how she or he negotiates with students from different backgrounds. Differing cultural capital is not reflected either in the nature of textbooks or in the nature of the teachers 7 training.

Official memory sites like museums, monuments and memorials not only reflected but also shaped ethnic relations to a great extent. The emerging states in the region have assiduously favoured the historical imagination of a politically dominant community, which is masculine, and remains persistently insensitive to the marginal "others" in the state. This, on the one hand, encouraged the dominant community to assimilate and thereby produced ethnonationalism around that notion of shared pasts. On the other, it generated a sense of neglect in the minorities who responded with vernacular memorials to embody their historical imagination and likewise developed their own ethnic nationalism around it. This parallel rise to prominence of often competing ethnonationalisms within the region, or sometime within the state, has thereby produced violent forms of contestation often dangerously imbued with fissiparous tendencies.||JANGKHOMANG GUITE

In India, for instance, faced with growing misery in the midst of accelerating growth, the standard response has been that such "exclusion" will disappear if the growth rate can be further accelerated. The proposition that an acceleration of the growth rate in the capitalist segment will be accompanied by an increase in unemployment in the economy as a whole, which is the basic element underlying poverty (as Marx had recognised), cuts at the foundation of all such claims.||PRABHAT PATNAIK

It filters the unfounded claims, which arise from a poor understanding of how the PDs and NREGS function, from the genuine ones. On the latter, there are several demanding conditions that need to be met in order to reap marginal benefits. A hasty linking of the PDS/NREGA with the UID can be very disruptive. Therefore, other cheaper technological innovations currently in use in some parts of the country to fix existing loopholes in a less disruptive manner are explored.||REETIKA KHERA

The right over the natural resources of Assam has been an issue of contention between the central government and Assam in post-independence India. The discovery of a new oilfield in Assam immediately after independence led to conflicts not only between the Assam and the central governments, but also between the Government of India and the Assam Oil Company and its equity holder, the Burmah Oil Company, since there were moves to nationalise minerals. Though the conflict between Assam and the government of India started over the location of the refinery, the debates in the public sphere and in the Assam legislative assembly raised larger issues like the rights over natural resources, the question of Assam's development and the centre's role in it and the relation between the centre and the state.||DITEE MONI BARUAH

Poor Indians with homes in rural areas are no longer simple peasants or rural wage labourers. They are also dependent on migrant wage labour, on working in the rural non-farm economy and on petty commodity production and trade in the capitalist economy. This calls for revisiting the relevance of categories such as "poor peasant", "middle peasant", "rich peasant" by exploring the significance of the links that almost every single rural household seems to have (for its reproduction) with the wider economy beyond the village confines.||ALPA SHAH,BARBARA HARRISS-WHITE

India's relatively high consumption is due in part to a historically low or no tax on bidis and an inefficient, complex system of taxing cigarettes. In the context of planned tax reforms in India, we provide specific recommendations to raise tobacco taxes and to adopt a simpler and more efficient tax administration that would curb smoking. We estimate that raising the tax as a percentage of retail price from 7% to 33% for bidis and from 43% to 58% for cigarettes would conservatively lead to about 14 million smokers quitting and 27 million children never starting, thereby saving some 69 million years of healthy life over the next 40 years. The increase would also raise about Rs 73 billion or an additional 1.2% of current government revenue, while incurring no or minimal economic harm. Modest action on tobacco taxes in India might well save millions of lives.||PRABHAT JHA,EMMANUEL GUINDON,RENU A JOSEPH,ARINDAM NANDI,RIJO M JOHN,KAVITA RAO,FRANK J CHALOUPKA,JAGDISH KAUR,PRAKASH C GUPTA,M GOVINDA RAO

An understanding of the out-of-pocket expenditures required for cancer care can improve the healthcare delivery process in India, both for the patients and families on the one side, and the health professionals and administrators on the other. This study estimates the expenditures borne by the surveyed patients for diagnosis and initial cancer-directed treatments as direct and indirect costs. Out of the one million newly diagnosed cancer patients per year in India, nearly 50% are suitable for curative cancer-directed therapy. It will be a highly justifiable approach to make financial provision for those cancer patients who cannot meet treatment costs and may be denied the benefits of cancer care.||BIDHU KALYAN MOHANTI,ABHIROOP MUKHOPADHYAY,SANGHAMITRA DAS,KULDEEP SHARMA,SOUMITRA DASH

In spite of continuous efforts towards improving the methodology of the BPL census, a significant difference between the "estimated" and the "identified" poor still persists. Against this backdrop, this paper attempts to develop an alternative method based on "vulnerability criteria" for the identification of the poor. Estimation shows that the prescribed criteria not only reduce the exclusion error significantly, but also suggest inclusion of a larger number of vulnerable households in the BPL list. Because of the data limitations, this exercise remains tentative. Nevertheless, it sets the possibility of further exploration to address the issue of large-scale errors.||MOTILAL MAHAMALLIK,GAGAN BIHARI SAHU

Questions of timeliness, weights in the price index, accuracy of food price measurement, and inclusion of the prices of services are relevant to the choice of measure. This paper looks at detailed price data, expenditure patterns of households and the composition of different price indices available in India, and discusses policies on inflation measurement in other countries. Under present conditions of measurement, the consumer price index for industrial workers, despite some serious deficiencies, is preferable to both the wholesale price index and the GDP deflator as the headline inflation rate. Thus, macroeconomic analysis and policy thinking need to move away from a focus on the WPI to the CPI-IW.||ILA PATNAIK,AJAY SHAH,GIOVANNI VERONESE

It thus leaves out the large majority of women in the unorganised sector. A new scheme such as the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana which is being piloted in 52 districts implicitly recognises the need to compensate for wage loss due to maternity and provide support for the mother and child's nutrition. However, a series of exclusionary clauses mar the objectives of the scheme. This paper attempts to demonstrate the misguided "targeting" of this scheme. The Planning Commission is preparing to scale it up at the national level in the Twelfth Plan, perhaps with the same set of incentives and disincentives as are currently spelt out in the pilot phase document. The data clearly shows that if these exclusionary clauses remain they will "victimise the victim".||LAKSHMI LINGAM,VAIDEHI YELAMANCHILI

The Mumbai Metropolitan Region is one of the most important growth engines for India as it accrues tremendous revenues to the central and the Maharashtra state governments. The paper assesses the performance of the governance system in MMR which resembles a polycentric governance system — a system that has been heralded as being greatly suited to metropolitan regions by several scholars. It recognises that metropolitan governance is but a concept, since in reality it comprises a loose bundle of multiple actors and organisations. For sharper focus, the paper studies the interactions between the only two (dominant) public organisations in governance — Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority.

This has contributed to the increase in India's overall savings rate. Using firm level data of public limited companies for the period 1998-99 to 2006-07, this paper employs a random effects model to study the determinants of private corporate sector savings. The empirical results of the panel regression indicate that corporate tax rate, availability of external funds, cost of borrowings, interest burden and value of production as a percentage of manufacturing expenses are the major determinants of corporate savings during the period. Dividing the sample into large and small firms based on their sales in 2006-07, we find that the significance of determinants varies considerably between these two firm groups.||RAMESH JANGILI,SHARAD KUMAR

Its mandate is to suggest a strategy for universal health coverage rather than a universal healthcare system. The latter would be geared to a progressive socialisation of healthcare based on human rights. Universal coverage, on the other hand, would mean a system that will continue to be dominated by the logic of the market.

Using the 2004-05 Employment-Unemployment Survey along with the Consumer Expenditure Survey, it estimates that the extension of minimum wages at existing levels could improve the earnings of 73 to 76 million low-paid salaried and casual workers. It also shows that if an extended minimum wage is perfectly enforced, it would substantially reduce inequality, poverty and the gender pay gap, even if there are some disemployment effects.||PATRICK BELSER,UMA RANI

Once their utility was over, they were dismissed by their employers and left stranded in a foreign country. This article examines this tension-ridden interaction between the contemporary English society and certain sections of the Indian immigrant underclass in England in the 19th century.

The sector's performance has been about the same before and after the economic reforms in the early 1990s. The reforms that brought a dramatic acceleration of growth in urban sectors have essentially had no effect on agriculture. Slow agricultural growth has had ill-effects on food security, food price inflation and poverty reduction because of the inadequate level and composition of public expenditure. Agricultural education, research, extension and a wide range of ancillary public institutions have also suffered. Agricultural growth always demands massive public goods provision and that in turn requires a radical reorientation of central, state and district government activities. This paper advocates a new integrated, technology-led strategy to pull out of, what looks like, a vicious circle that agriculture is now caught in.||BHUPAT M DESAI,ERROL D'SOUZA,JOHN W MELLOR,VIJAY PAUL SHARMA,PRABHAKAR TAMBOLI

Building such accommodation is the responsibility of the developer; managing it thereafter is in the hands of a different agency, and subsidising the families that live there is a third function separated from the first two.||SHIRISH B PATEL

The AIBP needs to be taken back to the drawing board and redesigned, based on the Accelerated Power Development and Reform Programme, which encourages and supports states to undertake management reform, promote accountability, restructure incentives and improve all-round performance of power utilities. This will accelerate irrigation benefits more than simply funding more dams and canals as the AIBP has done all along.||TUSHAAR SHAH,MAHENDRA SINGH

But mere legislation cannot bring about reforms, without accompanying mass struggles to get them implemented by the executive agencies and grass roots movements to change social habits. The forces of corruption which are deeply embedded in our society will not give up easily, and are powerful enough to frustrate and resist the provisions of any Lokpal Bill.

It is also an example of the new patterns of segregation of India's urban population on class and ethno-religious lines albeit by using the politically correct language of landownership rights.

Relative to the one currently in use, the application of the proposed methodology appears to be more beneficial in general to social groups such as scheduled tribes, most backward classes and mahadalits, as well as those landowning households that might suffer from specific debilitating conditions. However, in some cases it is less sensitive to Muslims, non-mahadalit scheduled castes and agricultural labourers. These observations are based on the results of a census survey covering 4,500 households in 18 rural wards of Bihar and West Bengal. By comparing the subset of households classified as poor according to the 2002 and the 2009 methodologies, the paper analyses "moving in" and "moving out" of poverty lists according to occupational categories, caste groups and landowning profile of the poor.||INDRAJIT ROY

A categorical breakdown is proposed to improve upon these studies, and a simple alternative procedure, the pipeline method, is then estimated to properly correct for selection bias. The results indicate that SHG participation has an impact on assets, livestock income, and salaries. Applying more advanced methods, training is also found to have a positive impact on assets, and empowerment is found to increase with SHG participation.||RANJULA BALI SWAIN,ADEL VARGHESE

It is estimated that a total of $213.2 billion was shifted out of India between 1948 and 2008, or about 17.7% of India's GDP at end-2008. Applying rates of return on these assets based on the short-term us Treasury bill rate, the total gross transfers of illicit assets by Indian residents amount to $462 billion at the end of 2008. Over this period, illicit flows grew at a compound nominal rate of 11.5% per annum while in real terms they grew by 6.4% per annum. An important finding is that illicit flows from India are more likely to have been driven by a complex interplay of structural factors and governance issues than they are by poor macroeconomic policies. There are reasons to believe that the cumulative loss of capital is significantly understated because economic models can neither capture all sources for the generation of illicit funds nor the various means for their transfer.||DEV KAR

This arrangement was affected by the World Bank's entry into the domain of urban-sector funding in 1975, which, despite stiff resistance from the implementing agencies, eventually managed to change the focus of local policies and to a great extent delink the TNSCB from political influence. The effects of this can be seen in the TNSCB'S current housing policies.||NITHYA RAMAN

The implicit subsidy for households below the poverty line from PDS foodgrains alone is roughly equivalent, in many states, to a week's NREGA wages every month. The revival of the PDS can be traced, in large part, to a renewed political interest which manifests itself in state initiatives such as expanded coverage, reduced prices, computerisation of stock management, etc. A large majority of the respondents preferred to receive in-kind food transfers rather than cash transfers, except in Bihar where the PDS is still in very poor shape. Their testimonies, and the survey findings, point to many good reasons to be wary of a hasty transition to cash transfers. Further improving the PDS seems like a more sensible way forward.||REETIKA KHERA

With ethical complexities and challenges emerging in modern medicine, bioethics seeks ways in which people in societies can work together under the provision of medical care and research. The argument is conducted by means of a brief history of bioethics. The field is supposed to provide an insight into the issues of moral community, and into how society understands political authority and its appropriate exercise. As a social movement, bioethics developed in the mid-20th century as a critical discourse, a response to felt inhumanities in the system of healthcare and biomedical research.||VIJAY KUMAR YADAVENDU,DEEPAK KUMAR

Several factors were involved in the rise of disability movements in the late 1980s and 1990s. Among these was a much more accountable state policy, the strong presence of women's movements, and the interest and push of international agencies, the presence of which created a more conducive space for the political mobilisation of marginalised groups such as the disabled. The passing of the Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 owes much more to international pressure than to lobbying and protests by disability rights groups. The disability rights movement in India is still trying to register its presence in the public sphere. It has, however, undoubtedly touched the lives of masses of disabled persons and pushed for a more disabled-friendly environment in the country.||NILIKA MEHROTRA

A close examination of the objectives of the subsidies in fertiliser and kerosene and the implications of the shift raises some challenging questions. While there is no doubt that India will have to move to a greater use of cash transfers, it may not necessarily be the best option in all cases.

Ideally, estimates of calorie consumption and the assessment of food security would be similar under a wide variety of assumptions, and the range of estimates would be quite small. However, this paper, which estimates the calories consumed per Indian household using the 61st round of the National Sample Survey, finds that the assessment of food security varies significantly under slightly different assumptions. Given the significant amount of measurement error in estimates of calories consumed, it is important to analyse not only household consumption surveys, but also aggregate food availability studies and health surveys collecting anthropometric measures that accompany undernourishment, such as stunting.||SHARAD TANDON,RIP LANDES

The globalised economy, hegemonised by immaterial labour, creates conditions for these new towns to culturally secede from their national or regional location and align themselves with the global cities. However, the condition of post-coloniality, characterised by capital and its wasteland, manifests itself in the new towns as the slow but inevitable encroachment of the excluded population on these new zones of exclusivity.||RAJESH BHATTACHARYA,KALYAN SANYAL

It also considers the converse of this question - can an analysis of the centrality of a particular kind of state formation to the making of empire help us understand some of the deeply undemocratic imperatives and neocolonial ambitions of the postcolonial nation state today? It argues that crucial modes of governance, particularly the relation between the militarised state and its subject populations that characterised colonial empires, extend to the present moment. In addition, it examines the situation of Jammu and Kashmir to show how the government of independent India has renewed both colonial legislation and colonial attitudes to deal with challenges to its authority, particularly from populations at its peripheries who wish to choose their own form of national political formation.||SUVIR KAUL

In Indian cities unprecedented and unregulated growth, incremental land use change, privatisation and chaotic civic infrastructure provisioning are fracturing resources created over centuries and reducing the right to the city to mere right to housing and property, thus short-changing the concept's transformative potential. Urban actors need to draw inspiration from the way social movements world over including in India have deployed the notion of the commons as a defence against corporate exploitation of biodiversity. Envisioning the right to the city as the fundamental human right, a demand for a just and sustainable social order where collective resources are respected and regenerated to support life, entails a democratic approach to the creation of knowledge about our cities. Such knowledge creation is necessarily a collaborative effort involving citizens who are differentially located in relation to the commons -policymakers, neighbourhood residents, workers and academic researchers.||ANANT MARINGANTI

With the British invasion the picture began to change gradually. Opening up of the Brahmaputra Valley in 1826 brought about two major changes in the mode of surplus extraction. One, colonial capital flowed into tea plantations, along with indentured labourers from mainland India. Though immensely profitable for the planters, this had a limited impact on the larger peasant economy of Assam. A more fundamental second change — spurred by the revenue of the colonial state, infusion of merchant capital and immigration of peasants from East Bengal — started a process of land alienation, commercialisation and indebtedness. In time, the agrarian economy of Assam started to resemble, and become firmly integrated with, the rest of the subcontinent. This essay examines a few aspects of this economic change.||DEBARSHI DAS,ARUPJYOTI SAIKIA

First, the IEC had no impact on enrolment, but households who were part of the household survey sample and therefore received information closer to the enrolment period were 60% more likely to enrol. Second, there is little evidence that the insurance company selectively enrolled healthier households. Instead, hospital claims were lower for households who received the IEC and for households who received both the survey and the IEC, suggesting that the marginal household enrolled was in fact healthier. Implications for the programme and its evaluation are discussed in the light of these findings.||JISHNU DAS,JESSICA LEINO

What these events suggest is that there is a growing crisis and contradiction within and between the institutions of the state in Pakistan and these crises and contradictions, evaluated differently, might offer a completely divergent narrative.

Communities that were dependent on particular commons could become less dependent, or abandon those commons. New communities of interest might emerge. Examining the transformation of a lake in Bangalore, this paper argues that in the community struggle towards creating and claiming commons, claiming the sphere of planning is fundamental. Further, the making or unmaking of the commons involves the making or unmaking of communities and vice versa. In the case of the Rajapalaya Lake studied here, this occurred and occurs at the interface where democratic struggles and bureaucratic systems meet.||JAYARAJ SUNDARESAN

One is a non-profit website while the other is a for-profit one and their approaches differ to an extent. However, the ideological divide is very thin and both are complicit in and contribute to the digital imperialism that "produces" the subaltern online. The writers suggest that reflecting on this might be a step towards imagining alternative modes of online inclusivity.||RADHIKA GAJJALA,ANCA BIRZESCU

While natural rubber productivity has grown rapidly, that of coconuts has barely increased over time. This paper seeks an explanation for this differential performance in terms of relative rates of diffusion of new technologies facilitated by their respective Sectoral Systems of Innovation. The SSI of rubber consists of an articulated regulatory policy mechanism which ensured that the new technologies that were generated by the research arm of the regulatory body itself were adopted by the farmers. Contrary to this, in coconuts there appear not much evidence of diffusion of new technologies and its SSI is characterised by a lack of cohesiveness with a multiplicity of actors operating at sub-optimal scales. However, some concerted efforts have been made over the last 10 years or so to develop new technologies and its diffusion among farmers and this has started bearing fruit in the form of increases in productivity, specifically since 1995-96.||SUNIL MANI,V SANTHAKUMAR

This coincided with a change of government and heightened public concerns about the adverse impact on poverty of the economic crisis. Federal as well as provincial governments demonstrated an unprecedented level of commitment to cash transfers and other programmes aimed specifically at the poor and vulnerable. The federal government's Benazir Income Support Programme was protected by law, and became the first targeted cash transfer programme to reach up to 7% of all households. It is too soon to say that social protection in Pakistan has finally turned a corner since the future course of public policy is vulnerable to political turbulence. This paper argues for measures that will signal that there has indeed been an irreversible paradigm shift.||HARIS GAZDAR

The reforms were expected to result in a high growth rate coupled with a structural change towards high technology industries. This paper analyses data on 60 three-digit industries, reclassified into four technology-intensive subgroups, for the period 1980-81 to 2005-06. Dividing this period into the pre-reform (1980-81 to 1991-92) and the post-reform (1992-93 to 2005-06), the paper uses the single kinked model to reveal a slower trend growth rate of value added for about 77% of the industries in the post-reform period. Further, the study does not find any significant structural transformations within the organised manufacturing sector, which is still dominated by relatively low technology industries. The results thus refute the neo-liberal optimism regarding reforms. In an increasingly technology-driven world, promoting industrialisation isa multidimensional complex task that requires a constructive role of the government.||SWATI MEHTA

Its members have gone through a vast range of emotions during the last two decades, from self-hatred to self-righteousness. Liberalisation of the economy has created for this class an excitement of many kinds. It has meant the freedom to pursue the quest for wealth without guilt and, at the same time, it has meant feeling set adrift from tradition and the culture it signifies. Life under the regime of liberalisation has also meant seceding from the physical spaces that constitute the shared habitation of the rich and the poor, by creating selfenclosed townships.||KRISHNA KUMAR

Peasant movements were successful in raising the support prices for the apple crop in the early 1990s. Small landholdings and low productivity, coupled with the withdrawal of state support have raised the cost of production substantially, and denied remunerative prices to the poor and marginal growers.

Such perspectives, most recently articulated by Akhil Gupta, forget that state power often operates through precisely such a critique of the chaotic nature of government in the present, which it contrasts with the unified, coherent institution it attempts to create in the future. The language of fragmentation is a product of modern governance. This article traces the origins of modern state practices in India to the anxious efforts of colonial officials to govern a society they had little emotional connection with. The estranged relationship of colonial officials with Indian social practices allowed them to produce a "progressive" form of rule that lived in the future, and abandoned any attempt to meaningfully engage with India's present day.||JON E WILSON

A government-appointed committee (the Rangarajan Committee) has also given its response to these proposals. Both these proposals agree on the desirability of a universal NFSA but finally propose targeting at the poor as defined by the Tendulkar Committee. This has been justified in view of the constraints set by foodgrain procurement and management. This paper argues that a universal NFSA is not only desirable, it is also a more efficient and feasible way to ensure food security for all. While presenting a critique of some of the assumptions made by these two proposals, this paper also offers an alternative which is near universal and feasible without using below poverty line targeting that has proved to be a colossal failure. This alternative, based on the results of a recent pilot for the BPL Census and which takes on board the concerns of its detractors, can be a way forward to a universal NFSA.||HIMANSHU,ABHIJIT SEN

When Maruti started operation in 1983, it was a turning point in the passenger car market. Prior to this, there was a tendency for the assemblers of automobiles to produce parts and components in-house. The "tierisation" of subcontracting evolved from the operations of Maruti. Value chain governance in the industry shifted from integrated firms to captive units. With economic reforms, the subcontractors of Maruti began supplying their products to other assemblers too. The transformation was from captive value chains to relational value chains. Small and medium enterprises manufacturing auto-components that started business in the 1980s and the 1990s have grown. In the process, small enterprises have expanded to become medium and large enterprises. But in spite of a rapid growth of production, new entrants to the auto-component industry declined in the 2000s. The necessity of high technology led to a significant hike in the initial investment required and raised barriers to entry. But the existing SMES actively set up new units.||SHUJI UCHIKAWA

The Indian jute industry has been globally significant since colonial times and enjoyed a "major industry" status. Under globalisation it is found that the key structural ratios like labour productivity, capital intensity and total factor productivity have been increasing. But the falling trend of capital productivity with low growth of capitaloutput ratio signifies the general deterioration of the quality of investment and its improper utilisation over time. The lower ratio of value added to output also indicates the use of cost-ineffective technology by the industry. At the organisational level, this low value added to output also signifies smaller factory sizes and increasing horizontal integration within the sector.||ANUSRI PAL,PINAKI CHAKRABORTI

However, a complex entwining of caste and gender has consistently defined water allocation and access among users and entrenched fractures in the structure and culture of the policy-implementing and regulatory institutions. Contrary to popular assumptions, both official welfare-based supply and recent neo-liberal policies and interventions hinge on a tokenistic, segregated and apolitical mention of gender and/or caste concerns which, when translated into action, have often reinforced existing inequities. Based on the above observations, this paper argues that subsequent changes in domestic water policies have only served to exacerbate an enduring unequal social order around water in India.||DEEPA JOSHI

In light of the recent debates surrounding the formulation of ecotourism guidelines for tiger reserves, this article undertakes a critical analysis of some of the ecotourism policies and programmes of the Indian government so far. It evaluates the ecotourism discourse specifically within the paradigm of sustainable development, which forms its legitimising base. The fragmented nature of ecotourism policies and practices and the resultant trade-offs unearthed, are then traced back to the contradictions and vagueness inherent in the very conceptualisation of ecotourism as a tool of sustainable development. This shows that revisions in guidelines, without a critical evaluation of the underlying conceptual basis, will not sufficiently address all the lacunae entailed.||SUCHISMITA DAS

Over the last decade, a number of PPPS providing maternal health services have come into existence but few have been evaluated. This paper examines whether PPPS with the for-profit private sector which provide maternal health services have contributed or are likely to contribute to making quality maternal health services accessible at affordable prices to the poor and marginalised sections of the population, as envisaged by policymakers. The limited evidence indicates that they have not increased either availability or physical access to services for a vast majority of women living in rural areas. The investment of substantial government and donor resources in PPPS without robust evidence on their contribution to reduction of maternal mortality does not appear justified.||T K SUNDARI RAVINDRAN

There is also an ongoing debate about whether and how the 2007-08 price spike might have been driven by financial speculation in commodity markets, and the role it is playing in the current episode of excessive price volatility. This note critically examines the debate.||ANIS CHOWDHURY

Given that the flow of agriculture credit has not necessarily been inclusive in the last decade, this analysis points out that while deciding on the targets for the Twelfth Five-Year Plan, it is important to address the regional and size imbalances. It is also important to recognise the need to synchronise the flow of credit with the agricultural seasons so as to optimise its impact on agricultural production.||NIRUPAM MEHROTRA

On the Politics of Development Economics||It could possibly be sheer historical coincidence that development economics as a distinct branch of economics was born at a time when the cold war was blossoming. But the question as to what has subsequently happened to the fate of the sub-field along with the trajectory of the cold war - the great "intangible" battle fought mainly in the spheres of ideology, economics, politics and propaganda between the capitalist and socialist blocs - cannot be similarly left as a historic fluke. A detailed substantive academic attempt at examining/establishing the latter apprehension has so far remained suspended or sometimes just taken for granted in most retrospective accounts of development economics. This paper makes a systematic study of the issue and argues that the evolution of development economics has been heavily mediated by international politics and that development economics, as it exists in the post-cold war era, entails a great delusion in relation to its original purpose, promise and priorities.||ARUP MAHARATNA

Defining the ideal national character or identity is a matter of political contestation, and so competing visions of nationalism can define the educational curriculum quite differently. In the light of this understanding, this study of textbooks maps how the conceptual triad of nation, education and gender is reflected in textbook content. It explores the historical (and from this, political) context of the languages and how this influences the vision of the nation that particular language textbooks create. It also examines how this historical context is reflected in the physical and emotional landscapes conjured up in the different language textbooks; in the way the other - the Muslim - is constructed.||DIPTA BHOG,PURWA BHARADWAJ,DISHA MULLICK

At the all-India level, diversion of PDS grain remains a serious issue; however there are interesting contrasts at the state level. Based on trends in monthly per capita purchase of PDS grain and estimated diversion, states are categorised into three groups "functioning", "reviving" and "languishing" states. The paper also discusses the possible reasons for the improvement in the PDS in the reviving states and questions the assessment of the PDS as uniformly and irreversibly dysfunctional.||REETIKA KHERA

People in the largest cities have achieved the greatest gains, followed by people in small towns and villages close to towns. Further away, in villages located more than five kilometres from the nearest town — home to more than half of the entire population of India — inflation-adjusted per capita incomes fell between 1993 and 2005. The steepest declines were experienced by the lowest income groups. Rising inequality is a natural result of these spatially distributed trends. The debilitating effects of "distance from town" need to be countered by connecting outlying villages with more and better physical and social infrastructures.||ANIRUDH KRISHNA,DEVENDRA BAJPAI

While this process generated an environment for the proletarianisation of women on a global scale and facilitated the corporations in minimising their responsibilities towards labour, it also affected the bargaining capacity of labour. Eventually women proletarians started organising and registering their resistance. Women's non-governmental organisations and transnational feminist networks came forward to facilitate the women proletarians' movement against the dominant mode of production. This movement, however, was more inclined towards "quiet" resistance. This article analyses the significance of this "quiet revolution".||ANAMIKA PRIYADARSHINI

It gives the government complete power to acquire land for any "public purpose" while the courts have virtually adopted a handsoff attitude and allowed all kinds of land acquisitions for private companies. The proposed Land Acquisition Amendment Bill makes it much easier for the government to acquire land for any private company, is nonparticipatory in nature and has escape clauses as far as giving jobs to the displaced or the provision of "land for land" is concerned.

This empirical analysis signifies the concerns for the livelihoods of farmers, when the cost of depletion is disproportionately borne by the resource-poor farmers as they are unable to invest in capital and technology and are hence denied the benefits of groundwater irrigation that is subsidised by free electricity. This situation is perpetuated with further scarcity leading to unequal economic returns and, finally, takes the most exploitative form where the "large landlords" also emerge as "water lords" through surplus accumulation, forcing the small and marginal landholders to become landless agricultural labourers.||ANINDITA SARKAR

The aim of this paper is to understand the fundamentals of our foodgrains market and policy that lead to this situation and to suggest policies for rectifying this. The central argument of the paper is that it is imperative that we look at the entire system of food production, food procurement and the release and distribution of food. Trying to correct one segment of this complicated system is likely to end in failure. The paper argues that there are two different motives for foodgrain procurement by the state – to provide food security to the vulnerable and to even out foodgrain price fluctuations from one year to another. Further, how we procure the food has an impact on how we release the food, and vice versa. Inspired by the sight of foodgrains going waste, it is often made out to be that our central problem is that of poor foodgrain storage. This paper disagrees with this popular view. While we no doubt should improve our storage facilities, it is important to be clear that this in itself will not lower the price of food. To achieve that we need to redesign the mechanics of how we acquire and release food on the market.||KAUSHIK BASU

But it holds that the vernacular version had to navigate the structures of language and a social structure in which caste was an important feature to make itself comprehensible to other intellectuals, trade union leaders and workers. It was in this process that its strategy of obscuring caste subjectivities and creating a new identity of class found its greatest success and also its ultimate failure.||JUNED SHAIKH

This meant that analyses shifted away from labour, production relations and surplus value extraction typically grounded in Marxian modes of analysis, in favour of those focused on environmental sustainability, livelihood sustainability and a discourse on poverty. During this period, women's labour has been mobilised at an unprecedented scale and concentrated in the most exploitative jobs to fuel economic growth in fisheries. Even as industrial fisheries thrive on the labour of poor women, new analyses and new forms of organising are needed to fundamentally challenge this exploitation. Capital cannot be left unfettered to do as it pleases, but must be forced through stringent regulation to heed other considerations apart from profitability alone. Donor aid is, however, driving the non-governmental organisation increasingly towards conciliatory, mediatory roles, incapable of seeking solutions outside the framework of capital.||NILANJANA BISWAS

Efforts to get government help in combating this erosion passed through different stages of peaceful agitation and ultimately took a political character. People's resistance used oil blockade as an effective means of getting government attention. Unfortunately, the state's response has mostly been ad hoc and geared towards temporary measures to lift the oil blockade. This article has two objectives: to portray the nature of the problem of erosion in Rohmoria and to show the history of the peoples' movement and the state's response.||SIDDHARTHA KUMAR LAHIRI,JULI BORGOHAIN

Its members are not paid and it does not accept donations from any corporate entity, foreign funding agency or the government. However, this means that its members must have other sources of income. The group runs the risk of the commercialised media proving more attractive to those of its members who are either not politically committed enough or are looking for wider recognition.

This paper looks at the implementation of the scheme in Karnataka, drawing on a large survey of eligible households and interviews with empanelled hospitals in the state. Six months after initiation in early 2010, an impressive 85% of eligible households in the sample were aware of the scheme, and 68% had been enrolled. However, the scheme was hardly operational and utilisation was virtually zero. A large proportion of beneficiaries were yet to receive their cards, and many did not know how and where to obtain treatment under the scheme. Moreover, hospitals were not ready to treat RSBY patients. Surveyed hospitals complained of a lack of training and delays in the reimbursement of their expenses. Many were refusing to treat patients until the issues were resolved, and others were asking cardholders to pay cash. As is typical for the implementation of a government scheme, many of the problems can be related to a misalignment of incentives.||D RAJASEKHAR,ERLEND BERG,MAITREESH GHATAK,R MANJULA,SANCHARI ROY

Yet today, countries such as Bangladesh possess some of the most productive, mechanised and labour-intensive agricultural industries in south Asia. This paper reopens these debates in the light of: (1) the highly diverse patterns of rural mechanisation that have taken place in Bangladesh, India and Nepal since the 1980s; (2) current renewed interest in rural employment and rural economic growth; and (3) changes in global trade patterns.||STEPHEN BIGGS,SCOTT JUSTICE,DAVID LEWIS

The more salient of such objections are discussed, and models for implementing cash transfers based on existing technology and infrastructure are proposed. However, in conclusion, it is recommended that instead of centralised dismantling of the public distribution system, the decision on the means of delivery should be left to the states.||ASHOK KOTWAL,MILIND MURUGKAR,BHARAT RAMASWAMI

The availability for the first time of comparable all-India nutritional data for men and women enables us to examine the empirical basis of this belief. The analysis suggests that a huge gender gap in iron deficiency anaemia coexists with an absence of a gender gap in chronic energy deficiency. While gender gap in anaemia is a combined outcome of biological and social factors, the absence of gender gap in CED goes along with a stark socio-economic inequity in India.||SUNNY JOSE

While the policy initiative of introducing quotas for women in public bodies is welcome and necessary, it is certainly not sufficient for the success of decentralisation in a society ridden with discrimination based on class, caste and patriarchy, and where the culture of political patronage is dominant. The presence of vibrant social and political movements that propose alternative cultural, social and political paradigms would be a necessary foundation for major social changes. The success of decentralised water governance is constrained by the conceptualisation of the larger reform in water at one level and the notions of the normative woman, community, public and the private domains, and institutions at another. Unless all of these are altered, decentralised processes will not be truly democratic.||SEEMA KULKARNI

The relationship can be situated within the wider framework of an unstable structure (the Bengali bhadralok society in this case) and a multifaceted agency (the individual Rabindranath who inhabited that society), and the complementary role of the two in responding to and affecting on each other. Over a span of almost a century, Rabindranath played a twin role - one, as a creative artist, and the other, what we today define as a "public intellectual". During this period, he was pulled apart by bhadralok denigrators and hagiographers, and the reactions ranged from scorn to deification. This history of the contradictory reconstruction of Rabindranath's image by the Bengali bhadralok society reflects the social conflicts, intellectual debates and political pulls and pressures that had churned up and transformed that society during the last century — traversing great historical events like the anti-colonial national movement in India and the two world wars.||SUMANTA BANERJEE

The decision culminated nearly a decade of an intense tussle within the World Bank between the central and regional offices and between the India division and those in charge of resettlement; between the World Bank and transnational and national non-governmental organisations; between the World Bank and the Government of India and the Government of Gujarat; between the board and the management of the institution; and across many other areas of conflict. For the World Bank the Narmada issue was a defining moment in its relations with NGOS. There were also two lasting outcomes — a greater disclosure of information and the establishment of the independent Inspection Panel. However, even as issues relating to rehabilitation and environment are now integral to World Bank appraisals, there remain doubts within the institution about the importance of such concerns.||ROBERT H WADE

Being a targeted anti-poverty intervention, the SGSY prescribes quotas for women (40%) among the eligible poor and also mandates that 50% of self-help groups formed in an administrative block under the scheme be women's SHGS. This essay, through the prism of the SGSY scheme, attempts to understand how policy seeks to "mainstream" rural women from low-income households into market-oriented economic activities that seemingly facilitate a linear movement out of poverty. It examines how women themselves perceive the SGSY policy and the entrepreneurial identities it proposes they assume, and how selected women swarozgaris strive to engineer a fit between the imperatives of policy and their divergent life circumstances.||K KALPANA

While India can, and should, develop a system that will best suit its unique needs, it is clear that a more enforceable, practical system for dealing with conflict of interest is needed. Public disclosure of interests - including investments, employment and business ties - for members of both houses would be a constructive and trust-building first step.||ERICA LEE NELSON

Looking ahead, it points out that the ILO and India face common challenges arising from the increasing inequalities caused by globalisation, the difficulty of implementing a universal social and labour policy in an economy where the bulk of workers are outside the formal sector, and the need to better integrate social and economic policy across different arms of government. These problems call for improved patterns of organisation, influence and dialogue at the national level, but they also define an international agenda for the ILO.||GERRY RODGERS

Against the background of the current paradigmatic shift of development communication from state-led to market-led development, and a comparative study of news agencies in China, India and Russia, it argues that there is scope for rearticulating the role and significance of news agencies, even within a flawed, hierarchical system, that is more positive than what the old discourse might have indicated.||OLIVER BOYD-BARRETT

The contribution that the agency can make to a member country regarding employment generally takes the form of assistance in developing approaches, strategies and programmes, rather than direct action. As such, it has significantly influenced Indian policy on the subject. On the other hand, the ILO has gained substantially from India's expertise and experience in formulating its own approaches and applying them to employment promotion policies and programmes in other developing countries.

We analyse the auction design employed in the spectrum allocation for third generation and broadband wireless access services, assessing its success on the parameters of revenue realisation, efficiency, post-auction market structure, and impact on consumers. While the auction has been successful in mobilising revenue for the government, and has created little adverse impact for the consumers by maintaining the level of competitiveness in the mobile services market, these gains seem to have been offset by the loss in efficiency as well as a higher complexity of bidding strategies. In making the Lowest Accepted Bid a preferred pricing rule, the government accorded primacy to revenue realisation over maximising allocational efficiencies. Thus we propose alternative design elements which would have served the stated objective of enhancing allocational efficiencies better.||ALOK KUMAR

Farmers in semi-arid regions actively manage fertility and other soil properties through a wide range of practices that are based on local resources and knowledge. Empirical data reveals farmers' soil fertility management options are being undermined by government policies that give more priority to chemical fertiliser-based strategies. It is argued that equal importance should be accorded to farmers using organic and farmers using inorganic methods. By doing so, we not only maintain the soil in a healthy condition but also support the livelihoods of millions, especially small and marginal farmers.||B SURESH REDDY

It contrasts the old problematic of state socialism and ideology with another problematic that it calls "desireology", a new discipline that firstly emphasises the importance of understanding Hegel — the philosopher par excellence of the European Enlightenment and the French Revolution — and then transforms this understanding in the theories of the Leninist party and the revolutionary dictatorship of the proletariat.||MURZBAN JAL

The need to provision welfare within an accumulation regime premised on global competition, fiscal austerity and marketisation, and a simultaneous need to reduce labour costs and to ensure social security, to exclude and include labour appears paradoxical. Does this emphasis on social welfare by the local state imply resistance to or accommodation of the current growth paradigm? How does such welfare provisioning influence livelihood strategies of labour embedded in global production networks and subject to flexibilisation? What are the new spaces of mobilisations that the regulatory imperatives open up? This paper addresses these questions through a microlevel study of worker livelihoods and state regulation in Tiruppur in Tamil Nadu that has been integrated into global networks of commodity production through garment exports.||M VIJAYABASKAR

The share of the corporate sector in industry characteristics such as number of employees, total emoluments, gross output and value added has increased since the early 1990s, with a corresponding decline of the public sector. Moreover, in absolute terms, the manufacturing GDP of the corporate sector grew at a faster rate compared to the public and household sectors since 1999-2000. Indian manufacturing is thus increasingly being led by the private corporate sector. However, the share of compensation to workers and employees in corporate income has steadily declined, pointing to the limited benefits accruing to employees from corporate growth.||J DENNIS RAJAKUMAR

A paradigm shift in the way we understand, represent and experience the world subserves a new and aggressive corporate teleology. Technological convergence and digitisation, which held an initial promise of and potential for democratisation, collapse into vertical integration and monopolisation. In the process, cultural sovereignty is abstracted into a homogenised, make-believe, global marketplace, which reduces every individual to a consumer and excludes the real and abiding concerns of vast swathes of humanity. An intellectual resurgence must counter the counterfeit revolution of the information era.||SASHI KUMAR

This caused severe distress to farmers, a majority of whom sold their produce at less than the minimum support price. A record procurement of the rabi crop by state agencies could not mitigate the crisis, which has become an annual phenomenon. The lopsided policy of the Food Corporation of India in Andhra Pradesh of procuring rice instead of paddy is the root cause of the problem.||R V RAMANA MURTHY

The ingenious ways in which he does this through the aesthetic form of his poetry enables us to décolonise indigenous thinkers, and give them back their ability to articulate their own identities. The material they provide helps us change the terms of the conversation about modernity.

Using data on human casualties and damages suffered by the houses as dependent variables, and different meteorological, geophysical and socio-economic factors as independent variables, this study estimates a cyclone damage function to bring out the mitigating effects of the mangrove vegetation. The results show that mangroves did significantly reduce the occurrence of human deaths and the extent of damage to residential houses. Areas with mangrove protection are seen as having fewer fully collapsed houses and more partially collapsed houses. They are also found to have been more effective in reducing deaths than in reducing the damages to static properties.||SAUDAMINI DAS

Predictably, reactions from both the government as well as the LTTE'S supporters have been of denial or a selective acceptance of the report.

Even this low count could be misleading because most rural news is not about the farmers/villagers or about their concerns related to land, livestock, resources or farming. The content analysis of 968 news items shows that 36% of the coverage goes to issues of violence, accidents, crime or disasters. Less than 28% is about agrarian themes while 15% is about hunger, suicides, malnutrition, distress migration, displacement, or farmers' movements. The English newspapers had more coverage of rural distress than the Hindi ones. The authoritative sources quoted most often in the routine news tend to belong to the establishment.||VIPUL MUDGAL

In the area of women's health, the situation is further complicated by the fact that policy processes have to straddle a treacherous fault line between target-driven population-control goals on the one hand, and issues of individual reproductive rights and general well-being on the other. Most recent discussions of women's health policy in India argue that over time, such policies and the programmes associated with them are today more inclusive and sensitive to the articulated and apparent needs of the women concerned than they earlier were. Through a historical study of the relevant policymaking processes and discussions with those who intervene in such processes, this paper seeks to widen the debate on the subject by questioning the above views. Further, the paper argues that the trajectory of change has never been simple or linear. Policy shifts over time reflect the greater or lesser influence of a range of actors – including international donor agencies and pharmaceutical companies as well as the health and women's movements – apart from the ideological aims of the party in power. All these influences serve to constantly blur and shift the loci of policy emphases along non-linear trajectories, even if the core concerns remain relatively unchanged.||HARINI NARAYANAN

Whatever the overt reasons given for grouping, what underlies it is the assumption that all people in a given area, whether civilian or combatant, are potentially hostile. Grouping is thus an act of war rather than effective counter-insurgency. This article describes the process of grouping, forced labour, surveillance and starvation in the camps. While descriptions of the process of grouping are consistent, people's opinions vary on its implications for their own lives, depending on their past and current location.||NANDINI SUNDAR

Although MNES brought their subcontractors from their home countries during the 1980s, they started procurement from local suppliers to meet the targets of local content. Local suppliers accumulated relation-specific skills through subcontracting. As the domestic demand expanded rapidly in the 1990s, production volume exceeded the level required for subcontractors to secure economies of scale. More foreign assemblers and component manufacturers entered the Indian market. Strengthened competition encouraged foreign and local assemblers to improve supply chain management. The econometric estimation in this paper finds a significant and positive correlation between improvement of labour productivity of suppliers and total factor productivity growth rates in six machinery industries. The result of the estimation confirms the effects of backward linkage. Rapid expansion of domestic demand and competition are determinant factors of development of subcontracting. But the range of subcontracting is limited to a part of the organised sector.||SHUJI UCHIKAWA

Based on a primary survey, it was found that in the initial phase of the crisis, workers trimmed their spending on their social life. This was followed by a reduction in expenditure on health and education. As the crisis persisted, they were left with little alternative but to cut down expenditure even on essentials like food, shelter, clothing, etc. Further, distress caused by unemployment and a drastic reduction of incomes exacerbated domestic conflict, violence and depression, the brunt of which was experienced by women and children. The study finds that the impact of the crisis varied between gem polishing and construction industries and it was more severe for workers in the lowest income group in both industries.||S MOHANAKUMAR,SURJIT SINGH

This reveals that the agreement may cause a significant increase in India's imports of plantation commodities from the ASEAN countries, which is mostly driven by trade creation rather than trade diversion. The proposed tariff reduction may lead to some loss of tariff revenue to the government. However, the gains in consumer surplus outweigh the loss in tariff revenue resulting in a net welfare gain. Simulations based on both the models yield broadly similar results regarding the magnitude of total increase in imports. During the years to come, the plantation sector will have to realign the production structure according to the changing price signals. It is thus important to devise appropriate adjustment assistance schemes for plantation workers who might face displacement.||C. VEERAMANI,GORDHAN K SAINI

This paper attempts to revisit the concept of welfare through a discussion of ration card forms and practices from 1940 to 1960, a period that covered the late years of colonial rule when this document was first introduced and the early post-independence years when its purpose, form and function were furiously debated.

8/1/2011-14/1/2011||special article||27918012||India's Groundwater Challenge and the Way Forward||The groundwater crisis is acquiring alarming proportions in many parts of the country. Strategies to respond to groundwater overuse and deteriorating water quality must be based on a new approach involving typologising the resource problems and redefining the institutional structure governing groundwater. This approach is based on the notion of groundwater as common property. The complex nature of groundwater problems in India implies that a detailed understanding of regimes in different hydrogeological settings and socio-economic situations is the prerequisite for sustainable and equitable management. Further, the management strategies should be specified keeping aquifer-scales in mind. For the adoption of this new approach, reforms are needed in how we assess groundwater resources, map aquifers, monitor quality and in the legal and institutional framework for groundwater governance. A national programme of groundwater management based on this process-specific approach is needed to address the challenge.||P S VIJAY SHANKAR,HIMANSHU KULKARNI,SUNDERRAJAN KRISHNAN

It enjoyed mass support particularly of the local Catholics. The rival party was the pro-establishment Partido Ultramarino. The violence that ensued in Margao in 1890 during the municipal elections is known as the 21 September Revolt. It lasted for a mere 20 minutes though the military firing killed 12 persons on the spot besides injuring many more. Protest meetings were held not just in Goa but also in Bombay, Poona, Karachi and Zanzibar. Even the Canadian and American press condemned the brutality and carried news on the "Goa Revolution". This article brings out the history of that revolt in the context of the working of colonialism in Goa.||SHARON DA CRUZ,MAX DE LOYOLA FURTADO

The need to retain a degree of control over the operations of the investee companies in Indian hands is one of the justifications for the caps. In early 2010, the government specified the methodology for calculating indirect foreign equity in order to remove ambiguities in calculating the extent of FDI in a company. This paper argues that the percentage of shares or proportion of directors on the board does not necessarily represent the extent of control and therefore more direct intervention would be required if the policy objectives are to be achieved.||K S CHALAPATI RAO,BISWAJIT DHAR

By claiming that Lenin had internalised Hegelian dialectics as "the algebra of the revolution", the paper views Leninism as the sublation (Aufhebung) of centralism to mass politics, where organisation and the masses cease to exist as binary halves, but have been synthesised as "the union of free individuals". It encounters two terrains: (1) Marx's revolutionary humanism, and (2) dialectics that views concepts and ideas in the matrix of contradictions and conflicts and thus in permanent-revolutionary transitions. It consequently argues that Leninism has to be seen in the light of Lenin's encounters in the Philosophical Notebooks, rather than in a dogmatic and fetishised understanding of democratic centralism that began with the Stalinist counter-revolution.||MURZBAN JAL

Local leaders, arguing for or against separate states, are often seen as acting without intent and merely playing politics. This article argues that this is so because of a federal division of responsibility which facilitates state-level politicians to discount responsibility for their stance and encourages them to focus solely on short-term goals. The central government intervention in the debate about Telangana has meant that regional politicians have become less able to discount the future and have instead begun to engage with somewhat greater intent.||LOUISE TILLIN

The fact that India could not see itself through the eyes of Husain and, instead, interpreted his epiphanic invocation and celebration of our civilisational diversity as something narrow and divisive, points to the rapid thickening and blocking of our national arteries, constricting the openness we so hypocritically assume as our cultural credo and hastening the spread of iron in the soul.||SADANAND MENON

This paper analyses the present urban development policies with a focus on coverage at the state and size-class levels, the extent of equity and effectiveness of the programme. It works out the interdependencies of infrastructural investment in the public sector with those of socio-economic indicators. The study shows that only 58% of the urban population has been covered under JNNURM, the coverage being high in the developed states and metropolitan cities. Of the 5,161 towns/cities, 4,207 are yet to be covered. An analysis of the funding pattern clearly brings out the big city bias. The phenomenon of large-scale underutilisation of the funds and inability of the smaller urban local bodies to prepare detailed project reports and generate matching resources can be addressed by making special provisions for unconditional general grants, especially those in the economically backward states. This will certainly help in making the growth process more inclusive, where the urban poor would be partners in the developmental process.||DEBOLINA KUNDU,DIBYENDU SAMANTA

The analysis suggests that the euphoria about high employment growth during 1999-2004 was not justified nor does the concern about jobless growth in the subsequent years capture the changes in employment structure. A long-term analysis of employment trends reveals that changes in the employment pattern and workforce structure have been sluggish and do not conform to the standard employment-output relationship. The analysis also flags certain issues which have a bearing on the comparability of employment data before and after 1993-94. Large fluctuations seen after 1993-94 appear to be a result of the movement in and out of labour force of a substantial section of the population which is vulnerable and in the informal sector in a phase of rising overall rates of economic growth. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the results of the recently released 2009-10 survey.||HIMANSHU

There are a few practical and realistic alternatives to functioning outside the modern international banking system, which is based on interest payments. The so-called Islamic banks in India only hoodwink depositors by paying them no interest while profiting from investing their money elsewhere for interest.||ATHER FAROUQUI

This fact has important consequences for household living standards. In this paper the author explores significant changes in the 1990s and early 2000s that appear to have occurred as a result of out-of-pocket spending on healthcare in 16 Indian states. Using data from the National Sample Survey on consumption expenditure undertaken in 1993-94 and 2004-05, the author measures catastrophic payments and impoverishment due to out-of-pocket payments for healthcare. Considerable data on the magnitude, distribution and economic consequences of out-of-pocket payments in India are provided; when compared over the study period, these indicate that new policies have significantly increased both catastrophic expenditure and impoverishment.||SOUMITRA GHOSH

The study implies that restrictive monetary policy might be of only limited relevance in controlling non-food inflation. Public policy aimed at minimising the impact of input cost shocks might work better in the long run. In the meanwhile, the restrictive monetary policy followed by the Reserve Bank of India might worsen the downturn that has begun in January 2010.||NEERAJ HATEKAR,ASHUTOSH SHARMA,SAVITA KULKARNI

This article utilises the frame of reference in Johan Galtung's theory of violence to explore the interaction between cultural, direct and structural violence against Muslims. It points out how direct violence reinforces structural violence, and how cultural violence is used to justify both direct and structural violence on Muslim men, women and children. Consensus to such violence is found in a new understanding of the "self" forged in opposition to a common "other". The Gujarat pogrom of 2002, the most recent, massive and extensive use of violence against Indian Muslims, serves as a good example because it contained within it the multidimensional forms of violence defined by Galtung.||TAHA ABDUL RAUF

However, due to unseasonal rains, the production of onions declined by about 20% in the three major growing states during 2009-10 and 2010-11. The recent sharp rise in the prices of onions can be attributed to a decline in kharif production on account of unseasonal rains at harvest time in the major onion producing states, a reduction in the minimum export price and consequent increase in exports during November 2010 and a holding back of stocks by traders.||PURUSHOTTAM SHARMA,K C GUMMAGOLMATH,R C SHARMA

The decision-making system is seen to be ad hoc, and not sufficiently transparent or participative. The DPR suffers from serious methodological and analytical errors, and has exaggerated the benefits from the proposed project. This analysis, along with the experience from other cities, suggests that cities are increasingly seeking single large, big-budget solutions to their urban transport problems without exploring the many simpler, cheaper and more effective options available.||ASHOK SREENIVAS

For nearly two centuries these poems have circulated whenever there has been a major crisis in, what may be called, the psychic world of south Asian Muslims. The first recorded appearance was in 1850, after the "Jihad" movement of Syed Ahmad had failed in the north-west, followed by serial appearances after the debacle of 1857, the dissolution of the Ottoman Caliphate and the failure of the Khilafat and Hijrat movements in 1924, the Partition of the country and community in 1947, and the Indo-Pak war of 1971-72. Curiously, these poems have re-emerged in Pakistan in 2010, and have found wider circulation on the internet. This paper traces the evolution of these poems since 1850, contextualises their appearances and offers some explanation for their hold on the minds of the Urdu-knowing Muslims of south Asia.||C M NAIM

This paper makes a systematic effort to assess the performance of the family welfare programmes vis-à-vis the trends in expenditure. The trends in key performance indicators for India and selected states reveal that progress has been slow and limited in the post-RCH policy regime. Child immunisation coverage has decelerated, and the increase in the contraceptive prevalence rate and institutional delivery coverage have stalled. Consequently, the pace of reduction in the total fertility rate and infant mortality rate has slowed. Overall, the progress in key programme indicators is found to be incommensurate with rising expenditure.||P AROKIASAMY,CHANDER SHEKHAR,K SRINIVASAN,SRINIVAS GOLI

Recent conservation interventions by the State with the creation of national parks governed by rules and regulations entailed a loss of use and access rights to forest areas and produce for the local people. This also led to a change in the perceptions of the local people in the context of conservation of forests and wildlife as it created socio-economic and cultural vulnerabilities. This paper examines the causal factors which influence the changing perceptions of the local people towards state-created national park areas. The main aim of the study is to identify the significance of non-wood forest products for forest dependent people living in rural ecosystem spaces.

However, the overall impression is that they are capital-intensive and suited to large farms. In this context, a study was undertaken in nine states, mainly to examine the actual area covered compared to the potential area and to understand the adoption level of MI as well as to analyse the cost and returns under different farm categories. The results indicated that only about 9% of the MI potential is covered in the country. Key suggestions include reduction in capital cost of the system, provision of technical support for operation after installation, relaxation of farm size limitation in providing subsidies and the establishment of a single state level agency for implementation of the programme.||K PALANISAMI,KADIRI MOHAN,K R KAKUMANU,S RAMAN

The unfolding political scenario in Karnataka calls for a return to its founding moments as a linguistic state. In the early 1950s, Kengal Hanumanthaiah developed the idea of a "composite state" partly in order to channelise the discontent within Mysore about the possible loss of (caste) power but equally to provide an alternative matrix (that of development) within the expanded state. What were the roots of that alternative to the (linguistic) state that was being imagined, and have the recent political developments been a realisation of that imagined "composite state" or its demise? This article attempts to frame these questions through a return to the legislative assembly debates of the early 1950s.||JANAKI NAIR

Simultaneously, women are now, to a significant extent, organised in self-help groups. Through these about one-fourth of the households can access loans for small entrepreneurship or, rather more frequently, for smaller emergency/consumption loans. There has also been increased participation of women in the non-agricultural labour market and the emergence in Tamil Nadu of a rudimentary "barefoot" welfare state. In this article we report from a 25-year panel study of 213 agrarian households in six villages in Karur and Tiruchirapalli districts.||STAFFAN LINDBERG,VENKATESH B ATHREYA,R VIDYASAGAR,GÖRAN DJURFELDT,A RAJAGOPAL

The term social exclusion is multidimensional although its western use in a selective way about markets promoting equality separates it from the Indian emphasis on social justice as linked to ending discrimination of dalit groups. The concept of social exclusion is inherently problematic as it faces three major challenges in India: the first relates to the historical discrimination of certain groups and their exclusion; the second is about the political economy of the excluded; and the third questions the way in which equality responses are restricted within the framework of social exclusion.||VIDHU VERMA

Long before Yeltsin hauled the red flag down, this class-in-formation had already occupied positions of control over major productive assets; however, legally sanctioned property relations constrained it, and thus it could not systematically appropriate the surplus product. Convinced that Soviet relations of ownership stood in the way of economic development, leaders of the nomenklatura and their allies overwhelmed the demoralised and disorganised remnants of workers' power.||MARKAR MELKONIAN

These regimes utilise specific and connected racial and gendered ideologies and practices at their social and territorial borders - in the us-Mexico borderlands, the West Bank and Gaza, and the Kashmir Valley. They exercise militarised and masculinised forms of control, surveillance and dispossession that illuminate the contours of national political subjectivities and the uneven construction of citizenship. These imperial democracies militarise all domains of social life, and discipline or imprison not just abandoned and criminalised communities, but all state subjects. The essay suggests that an alternative vision of connectivity and solidarity requires building ethical, cross-border feminist solidarities that confront neoliberal militarisation globally.||CHANDRA TALPADE MOHANTY

It is this empiricisation that is far more worrying than the election defeat itself. In a period when many have abandoned the concept of imperialism, the CPI(M) remains steadfast in its adherence to this concept; as long as the concept and the project remain valid, the historical relevance of the party remains unimpaired. But if the party does not arrest the process of empiricisation it has been experiencing and finally ends up accepting the hegemony of bourgeois theory, then it will get supplanted by some other communist formation subscribing to a theoretical position similar to what it has today.||PRABHAT PATNAIK

In all countries of the world, relatively few firms participate in world trade, thus suggesting that besides country level barriers to trade, characteristics of a firm such as its size and productivity are relevant for participation in trade. Using firm level data, this study attempts to model and estimate the decision of Indian firms on their participation in trade. Firm heterogeneity is an important determinant of the decision to export. Exporting firms are significantly larger, more R&D-intensive, low wage-intensive, more productive and more profitable than non-exporting firms. The multinomial results reveal that the probability of survival of new firms in export markets is lower when compared to those which have been exporting in the previous years.||T N SRINIVASAN,VANI ARCHANA

The present essay offers a very brief evaluation of the methodology of poverty identification advanced by an Expert Group of the Planning Commission in 1993, and undertakes more elaborately what is essentially a critical assessment of the 2009 Tendulkar Committee's approach to specification of the poverty line.||S SUBRAMANIAN

Despite what its mandate would suggest the ILO (like India) has chosen to treat only certain selected rights as "fundamental" at the expense of issues such as those relating to conditions of work, wages and social security, which are equally constitutive of what it terms "decent work".

Historians need to unpack the complex and contradictory matrix that gave rise to Bengali nationalism, and the mixture of racism and hysteria that spurred the Pakistan Army on to a path of atrocities. This is essential for Bangladesh to decipher its post-liberation trajectory, and for Pakistan to excavate the roots of its current crises. Among several new books on the war is Sarmila Bose's Dead Reckoning, carrying a bizarre and shrill agenda of absolving Pakistan of allegations of a genocide. What we are left waiting for is a deep investigation into 1971—about the nature of violence, crisis bargaining, unintended consequences, and history's orphans. People's actions during war are always a combination of contradiction, heroism and failure of nerve; they are a fundamental aspect of being human. Bangladesh is still waiting for that human history of 1971.||NAEEM MOHAIEMEN

This essay does not suggest that humanity can once and for all overcome the imperial impulse, but emphasises making it unjustifiable in theory and untenable in practice. In other words, "taming" the imperial impulse, or understanding its rationale in ways that make empire unimaginable and imperial ideology unsustainable. This requires deliberate strategies, concerted action and deploying and supplementing existing normative and institutional resources for upholding the rule of law and protecting human rights everywhere. Instead of resorting to unilateral and extra-institutional "humanitarian intervention", it proposes that whatever political will and resources any state is willing to devote to protecting victims around the world should be directed at enhancing collective institutional action through the United Nations.||ABDULLAHI AHMED AN-NA'IM

Hence, blaming larger procurement and a higher MSP alone for the soaring wheat prices between 2008 and 2010 is an oversimplification of the problem. The experience with wheat procurement in the recent past suggests that foodgrain procurement at a lower MSP may not always be feasible. Finally, it is shown that the inability of the government to utilise the abundant wheat stocks for the benefit of the consumers during the recent phase of high foodgrain prices was due to the poor offtake of the grain allotted to the states, not to the operations of private trade via the government's open market sales window.||STHANU R NAIR,LEENA MARY EAPEN

It finds that once one looks at actual dependency — the ratio of nonworkers to workers — not only is this still very high, it has probably worsened in recent times. Moreover, it might worsen further if we achieve the highly desirable goal of eliminating child labour and the ultimately justifiable goal of reducing old-age labour, unless there is a major rise in working age labour force participation and/or productivity.||ALAKA MALWADE BASU

By analysing the speeches of the key actors and reactions of ordinary men and women, it is argued that the lack of international interest and the heavy burden that India faced due to the 10 million refugees it hosted explain the timing of and impetus for military intervention, an action with repercussions that are experienced even today.||NAVINE MURSHID

To stop the accumulation of reserves and thus minimise China's welfare and capital losses, the simplest solution would be for the People's Bank of China to end intervention in the foreign exchange market. Ending central bank intervention in currency markets is a complex issue. But the economic and welfare costs of China's slow pace in adjusting the exchange rate are very high and will only increase by the day. It is time for China to consider allowing the yuan to float freely, while reserving the right to intervene when it must, and tighten the management of cross-border capital flows which has become permissible under the Group of 20's agreements.||YU YONGDING

However, qualitative data collected as part of the probe Revisited survey in 2006-07 reveals that the expanded school market has become a new locus along which existing social inequalities are being reproduced and entrenched. An analysis of the dynamics of schooling choice in a village in Rajasthan attempts to answer the following questions. One, what determines schooling choice? Two, what is the relationship between the expanded school market and schooling quality within and between government and private schools? The paper thus provides a rich and detailed account of how an expanded school market changes the institutional culture within which parents make decisions about schooling and how education is affecting patterns of social disadvantage.||ELIZABETH HILL,MEERA SAMSON,SHYAMASREE DASGUPTA

The half-truths of forensics and the machinations of the police have succeeded in the trial, and 31 men, unfairly made to bear the burden of proof and denied vital witnesses, have been sentenced either to death or life imprisonment.||NITYA RAMAKRISHNAN

The ostensible reasons for the bill, viz, to address the low gross enrolment rate, and the poor quality and shortage of educational institutions in the country constitute the justificatory rhetoric that hides the agenda of opening the national higher education sector to world trade.||RAJAN GURUKKAL

Such low and even negative population growth in large cities and their core areas needs further investigation, since it raises concerns about exclusionary urbanisation.||AMITABH KUNDU

Despite a bill pending in Parliament since 2007, there has been little effort by political parties to evolve a consensus on acquisition of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes. The law as at present and also the provisions of the pending bill do not leave any scope for resistance other than on the issue of compensation. The UP government's new policy on land acquisition is an improvement but more needs to be done.||AVINASH KUMAR

Pakistan's modernity is structured along two axes: neo-liberal nationalism and right-wing radical nationalism. While the neo-liberal nationalism axis depicts an authoritarian and top-down model of economic and political development marked with the expansion of a national security-obsessed middle class and ruling elite, the right-wing radical nationalism axis denotes the growth of religious radicalism and militancy as symbols of geopolitical modernity that are anti-imperialist in nature. This analysis argues that liberalism is one of the many consequences of modernity, but not the only one. The meeting point of both trajectories has resulted in turning Pakistan into a hybrid-theocratic state which encapsulates a mix of economic neo-liberalism, pockets of social liberalism, formal theocracy and larger spaces experiencing informal theocracy.||AYESHA SIDDIQA

They strove for a new social order by writing and protesting against caste, untouchability, the indignity of the sudras and women, and all exploitative features of the sanskritic order. Puri, the great pilgrimage centre and the heart of Jagannata culture was the nucleus of their movement. It is in their works that we see most clearly the far-reaching transformations in social hierarchy, and what may be called "modernity", which began to take shape in medieval Orissa.||BASANTA KUMAR MALLIK

This, no doubt, is due to the electoral value that ows retains for Democrats seeking to get re-elected next year. The challenge for the left will be to continue to garner sympathetic media coverage and attention, while also finding ways to propose a specific policy platform that represents a challenge to Obama's corporatist, pro-Wall Street agenda.||ANTHONY DiMAGGIO,PAUL STREET

The place of aborigines in the political space of the settlement was further unresolved. The newcomers in the Andamans spent six years on a literal and conceptual beach: the limited space between the ship and the jungle. Not knowing how to integrate the Andamanese into the ideology of their intrusion, and unable to sustain the vision of a permanent civilisation in the islands, they fell into a state of panic and dispersed. This paper argues that the failed settlement represented a conceptual and logistical limit of the late 18th century imaginary of the offshore colony.||SATADRU SEN

Subjective Expectations on Education in Rural India||This paper presents the first results of a study conducted on subjective expectations that parents have about the costs and returns to education. This is done by using a detailed child-level dataset from the three villages of Dokur (Mahbubnagar district, Andhra Pradesh), Kalman and Shirapur (Sholapur district, Maharashtra). The perceived returns differ by region, gender of the child and caste, with girls and members of the scheduled caste and the tribe categories being at a disadvantage.||ANNEMIE MAERTENS

But is this enough to turn around a system of behaviour in government and among citizens that has evolved over a long period of time? It is clear that inputs and incentives do not automatically translate into higher participation in education. Within the system, "business as usual" is accompanied by apathy, while new opportunities and innovations seem to generate energy and can activate both citizens and front-line government workers to behave differently.||RUKMINI BANERJI

This essay analyses that conflict in terms of its impact on the legacy of Jawaharlal Nehru. It explains the roots of Nehru's interest in China, his hopes for relations between the two new nations, the origins of the border dispute, and its escalation into a full-fledged war. Nehru's policies are assessed from the viewpoint of his critics and admirers. The deeper structural reasons for the conflict between India and China are analysed. Finally, the essay also speaks to the shadow cast by the war of 1962 on the geopolitics of the present day.||RAMACHANDRA GUHA

In an integrated global economy, it is essential that the major economies coordinate their policies. But coordination does not imply simultaneous stimulus withdrawal from all G20 countries. Indeed, a phased withdrawal is probably the best guarantee against the risk of a negative global shock leading to another recession in the event of a simultaneous stimulus withdrawal from all G20 countries. Hence, this paper argues that each country needs to set the timing, scale and composition of its stimulus withdrawal keeping in mind its own macroeconomic outlook.||SUDIPTO MUNDLE,M GOVINDA RAO,N R BHANUMURTHY

Colonial census officials, working with concepts of varna and jati, struggled unsuccessfully to define and classify these into castes on a single pan-India list, where each caste had to be discreet, homogeneous and enumerable. The history of caste enumeration in the Indian census illustrates how difficult it is to capture indigenous social hierarchies and identities under the term "caste". We embark on a new caste census without having addressed many of these challenges.||PADMANABH SAMARENDRA

There are a number of scholars and activists who tend to valorise premodern wisdoms without critically evaluating their sociocultural context and realising how deeply they were embedded in the social hierarchy of their times. There has been, of course, a great deal of stress lately on a kind of"eco-golden age". This is clearly a case of an "anachronistic projection of modern phenomenon on to the screen of tradition". Seen from such a perspective, all pre-industrial societies would exhibit a kind of harmony with nature. However, most of the times, it was the demographic and technological factors that made these societies less harmful to the environment. It was not that they wished to protect the whole canopy of nature. This reappraisal demonstrates how precepts and rites, culture and customary practices and state policy interact to lay the bases of water harvesting traditions. Social customs are the necessary conditions for sustaining these traditions, while local autonomy in resource management is the critical sufficient condition but it never results in equitable access for all.||SHRI KRISHAN

The case of workers in the Shenzhen special economic zone in south China is representative of this trend. When agriculture was deprioritised there was an exodus to the cities. The "peasant workers" in Shenzhen are forced to pay taxes and fees in their native villages but are not officially accepted as urban workers and cannot enjoy the urban-based facilities that the latter do. They work in abysmal conditions for long hours and are not paid regularly. Moreover, any protest leads to instant job loss.||SWAPNA BANERJEE-GUHA

It was subsequently argued that the higher productivity of smallholdings would disappear with the adoption of superior technology, modernisation and growth in general. However, close to half a century later, National Sample Survey data from the initial years of the 21st century show that smallholdings in Indian agriculture still exhibit a higher productivity than large holdings. These smallholdings however show lower per capita productivity and the incidence of poverty is widespread. Strategies for Indian agriculture and smallholding households should include reducing the inequality in land distribution and promoting off-farm work in the rural areas itself. The strategy of improving the crop land-man ratio by facilitating migration from rural India has not worked and will not work. The lives of smallholding families can be improved only by building on their higher per acre agricultural productivity and by promoting off-farm rural employment.||RAMESH CHAND,P A LAKSHMI PRASANNA,ARUNA SINGH
