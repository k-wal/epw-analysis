In view the paucity of ex post evaluation studies, this impression still persists. The validity of this impression is probed in this paper with the aid of data thrown up by a recent important survey in the command of the Kal Irrigation Project, a major irrigation work in the Konkan region known for its very high rainfall. It is found that returns to irrigation can be substantial despite there being gross underutilisation of irrigation potential occurring primarily in the kharif season.||B. D. Dhawan

Two characteristics of the village that motivate the enquiry are (a) the occurrence of some growth in the economy, and (b) the implementation of a major anti-poverty policy that entails the creation of assets in the hands of poor households. The analysis of changes in inequality in the distribution of household assets among a set of village households indicates an extremely high degree of inequality in both years, which worsened over the study period. Further decomposition of inequality brings out the major role of land ownership in the observed rise in inequality. A combination of growth and redistributive policy failed to stem the process of polarisation in this village economy.||Madhura Swaminathan

But Mikhail Gorbachev's claim that the Soviet state and the CPSU have 'renounced everything that deformed socialism in the 1930s' is an exaggeration which only reveals a certain lack of comprehension of the enormous dimensions of this historical legacy. In fact, certain basic digits of thought, uncritically taken over from the past, like the idea that the USSR is in the state of 'developed socialism' and that the Soviet state is now an all people's state, along with the concept of the CPSU as the vanguard of society, carry in them germs of a possible neo-Stalinist development in the future.||Ajit Roy

This article evaluates Soviet collaboration in the steel industry over a period of 30 years on different counts such as the degree of indigenisation allowable, the comparative cost of design and engineering and equipment, the extent of transfer of technology, etc. While the study finds no evidence to support the hypothesis that Soviet soft, long-term credit is tied through commercial agreements to the sale of heavy industry equipment at higher than world market prices, Soviet terms and conditions since the mid-sixties have been systematically designed to perpetuate technological dependence.||Bernard D'Mello

In 1948 he committed the support of the government to the banning of communal political parties but did not implement the resolution. He agreed with Gandhi that the compulsory stoppage of cow-slaughter, taken as an isolated decision, would appear as a concession to Hindu bigotry and was therefore to be avoided; yet he did not oppose the listing of the banning of cow-slaughter as one of the directive principles of state policy in the constitution and was content to see that nothing came of it in practice. An even greater deficiency in his policy of merging religious communities in a general citizenship was the restriction of the insistence on monogamy to Hindu men and the grant of the rights of divorce and inheritance only to Hindu women. In his keenness to win the confidence of the Muslim community, he failed to ensure the equality before the law of all Indians and enact a common civil code.

Metaphorically speaking, gender differences constitute one of the great 'fault lines' of social groups-the lines of division along which resources, power and authority are allocated to group members. The processes of accumulation and distribution of resources within households reflect the subtleties of negotiation and bargaining among members but do so in a concrete form that can be observed and sometimes measured by non-participants. This paper provides both a general overview of the structural and demographic conditions shaping women's lives and a detailed look at urban lower-middle and middle-class women based on a study of 146 Jakarta women. Occasional comparisons are provided with other Asian societies, especially those with large Muslim populations, where women's access to labour markets is much more limited and the patriarchal family more dominant.||Hanna Papanek,Laurel Schwede

In countries targeted as strategic to a region, where high levels of class and national conflict between third world revolutionaries and western imperial countries are leading to a military-political defeat for the west. Washington is likely to shift from conventional arms to serious consideration of the use of nuclear weapons. The author analyses four case studies of international tension to test his hypothesis: (1) the US intervention in the Korean civil war (1950-54); (2) the Indo-China-French-US conflict (1945-1954); (3) the US-Cuban conflict (1959-1962); and (4) the Vietnam War (1965-1975).||James Petras,Morris Morley

The government's industrial and trade policies and the domestic market structure appears to have encouraged large firms to be more inward oriented. The domestic market for final products is not only protected from imports but also characterised by strong entry barriers, which, in turn, appears to have resulted in higher relative profitability of domestic sales compared to exports. On the other hand, several small firms, which concentrate in producing intermediate products for (a few) large firms appear to be driven to export markets to reduce their dependence on the domestic market. The paper derives certain broad observations and policy implications based on a firm level field study and a set of econometric exercises.||Murali Patibandla

The estimated results suggest that groundnut cultivators in India have been net 'subsidised'. Given short-term and long-term projections of world prices of groundnut (oil and meals), which are likely to remain depressed at around 1986 levels, it appears that degree of 'protection' will remain sufficiently high for Indian groundnut cultivators in the coming years. Even if one adjusts for premium on foreign exchange and one estimates 'adjusted' ESCs, which would be very close to cost benefit indicators such as domestic resource cost (DRC), the situation is not likely to change. The new set of 'adjusted' ESCs, when viewed from comparative advantage point, would indicate that groundnut is neither an efficient import substitute nor an efficient exportable commodity. It would also suggest that investment programmes to expand production of groundnut would yield low economic rates of return.||Ashok Gulati

Cost of cultivation data can be used to estimate parameters of the demand for pesticides. On the supply side, given the sheltered nature of the domestic market, there is need to develop policies towards the pricing of pesticides. Account has also to be taken of the development of more effective and newer pesticides, many of which are also environmentally less harmful.||Yoginder K. Alagh

For some it is a vital factor of production in their economic pursuits; while for some others it is merely a barricade for privacy in a highly congested urban environment. There is also another category of urban poor who live and earn their living with no form of shelter whatsoever. This study analyses the factors influencing the decisions of such truely shelterless persons living on the pavements of Calcutta city. The first section of the paper describes the data sources and survey methodology and presents a picture of the size, nature and magnitude of the problem. The second section analyses the economic characteristics of the pavement-dwellers, who as a class can be considered as the poorest of the urban poor. The third section examines the income-shelter linkages, and the fourth section seeks to derive some policy conclusions.||N. Vijay Jagannathan,Animesh Halder

It is paradoxical that when a large part of the world economy-consisting of the developing countries, whether they are highly indebted Latin American countries, debt distressed poor countries of Africa, or the relatively fast growing countries of Asia-is in dire need of additional resources in the form of foreign savings, the few countries which have some savings to spare, are being pursuaded to absorb them on their own by increasing their domestic expenditure. If the approach to international policy were different, and concentrated on mechanisms to improve international financial intermediation to channel the savings from countries where they are in excess supply to countries where they are in excess demand, the case of Japan would be regarded as one with great opportunities. The excess savings of Japan, and for that matter of all the industrial countries, should find their natural habitat in the developing countries to finance their investment needs that their domestic savings cannot fully meet.||Arjun Sengupta

This paper estimates demand for paper, paper board and newsprint upto 2000 AD. The author recommends that until 1992, the paper and paper board industry should concentrate on utilising existing capacity more efficiently rather than on capacity creation. The newsprint industry, however, needs to increase its production capacity tremendously if dependence on imports is to be reduced. The author has estimated the optimal economic size of a paper mill to be between seventy-five thousand and one lakh tonnes per annum. It is recommended that smaller paper mills should be encouraged to expand capacity so that economies of scale in production can be realised.||Alka Subramanian

In Section I, views on common sense (or 'ordinary' folk's sense-perceptions) as viewed in bourgeois traditions are briefly presented. Section II is about Gramsci's treatment of certain cases of the infiltration of these bourgeois accounts into the Marxist camp by way of his critique of Croce's and Bukharin's schemes. In Section III, Gramsci's own scheme on 'common sense' and its elements are proposed. Finally, in Sections IV and V, relationships between the hegemony process and the 'common sense' of subalterns, on the one hand, and relations between certain counter-hegemony systems and subaltern consciousness, on the other, are delineated.||Arun K.

It follows that the frontiers can then be suggestive of historical forces and their strength which are not necessarily anchored in an adequate development of capitalism and its nexuses of civil society.||Asok Sen

While all these objectives continue to be important, these and many other quantitative increases have been associated with a decline in quality which has detracted seriously from the benefits of growth on the one hand and has caused frustration, disillusionment and misery among the masses on the other.||A.

27/8/1988- ||review of industry and management, august 1988||4378962||Micro Computers and Development: Organisation and Management Issues in Local-Level Computing||Though micro computers were introduced quite early in developing countries, applications have remained peripheral to the development process. There is need to explore the potential as well as limitations of micro computers for users in developing countries. The rate, method of adoption and applications are important so that development administrators, aid agencies and non-governmental organisations avoid costly mistakes. This paper provides guidelines for a strategy for the introduction of micro computers: the priorities that should be followed, a methodology for their introduction in organisations and a framework to determine applications to improve decision-making. The introduction of micro computers is not dependent on cost reductions, computer programmers or structural arrangements; rather it requires explicit policy choices to integrate hardware, software, data and people. Reforming administrative processes, to deal with the organisational issues is a necessary first step, rather than relying only on technology. The paper concludes by arguing that decentralised, or end-user, computing is a precondition for institutionalisation of the processes and needs precise planning.||Mukul Sanwal

26/11/1988- ||review of industry and management, november 1988||4394047||Sickness in Indian Textile Industry: Causes and Remedies||Four points are worth noting about the nature of sickness in the textile industry: it is neither temporary nor isolated; it largely afflicts the organised sector; within the organised sector, the composite mills are suffering more; and it is more pervasive in the older textile centres like Ahmedabad and Bombay. While the problems of the composite sector in the older textile centres are predominantly the result of structural and environmental factors, it is also a fact that managements of textile mills suffered from static perceptions about the industry relating to raw material, technology, products and markets. These perceptions were conditioned by the general environment of a closed and highly protected economy and led to slow responses to market changes at the unit management level. Many of these problems were identified and accepted by the Expert Committee on Textiles and found expression in the new Textile Policy announced in June 1985. While lately there appears to be a greater desire to implement the new Textile Policy with some vigour, further macro-level remedial steps have to be taken. The major ones among these are discussed here as are managerial actions that have to be taken at the unit level. And even as the textile units implement the required strategy in the new environment, support will have to be provided to the sick units till they become healthy, calling for exercise of judgment on the viability of the unit, commitment and competence of the management and the need for funds and financial accommodation.||Prafull Anubhai

1/11/1988- ||special articles||4394011||Poverty Debate in India: A Minority View||Rural socio-economic change is often inadequately captured by social science research in the field. This happens partly due to perceptions of the researchers and partly due to inadequacies of research tools and approaches. This paper illustrates the situation by presenting evidence on incidence of rural poverty in two villages of Rajasthan as examined through different approaches, during 1963-66 and 1982-84. Households that have become poorer by conventional measurement of income in fact appear better off when seen through different qualitative indicators of their economic well-being. The paper suggests the need for supplementing conventional measurements of income by qualitative indicators of change to arrive at a realistic understanding of rural socio-economic change.||N. S.

Ethnic secessionist movements have damaged internal cohesion within states and inter-state relations as well. The involvement of exogenous forces such as the neo-colonial manoeuvring of erstwhile colonial powers and superpower rivalry have further divided the member states. In this crisis-ridden situation the OAU has survived, demonstrating a commendable staying power.||Rajen Harshe

The focus is on one particular expression of bourgeois ideology, namely, the concept of economic development. In recent times, there has been a critique of the traditional accumulation-based approach from within bourgeois discourse and an alternative consumption-based approach has been suggested. This dual approach to economic development reflects capital's attempt to incorporate pre-capital within the ambit of its ideology. It is argued that an extension of the Gramscian framework is necessary in order to capture the nature of hegemony in contemporary third world countries.||Kalyan K. Sanyal

This is the strength of this frame of reference. It compels us to think analytically as it draws attention to conflict, integration, struggle and change. It also reminds us that the issues of the fifties are over. While the Bharatiya Kisan Union's hyperlocalism, its distance from political parties and the undifferentiated nature of its peasant base may make it appear similar to many pre-independence peasant movements, yet a closer look confirms that the altered nexus of contemporary India has left its imprint on Tikait's organisation too. The farmers' movements of today, whether in west UP or in Maharashtra or in Karnataka, are also conscious of the changed character of the country-town nexus and that is why the demands of these movements are never single-pronged but multi-pronged, not just remedial but prospective too.||Dipankar Gupta

Bilateral and multilateral aid agencies are recommending privatisation of the public sector to developing countries. Indeed, in some cases international lending agencies have made privatisation a condition for their project and adjustment lending to several developing countries. This paper reviews the progress and examines the experience of privatisation in the US and UK as a backdrop against which to assess the experience of the LDCs. Reasons are given for the differential performance between the UK and US on the one hand and LDCs on the other.

When Macaulay introduced English education and partitioned Indian society by creating a new caste of English educated gentry, Bengali bhadraloks hailed it and by doing so helped in perpetuating the division. History shows that the importance of English could never be reduced at the lower level of education while retaining its pride of place at the higher level of education and in the commercial and administrative sphere.||Poromesh Acharya

At the all-India level, male/female wage differentials have decreased in 1974-75 as compared to 1964-65.

Such adjustment programmes are primarily concerned with balance of payments disequilibria. Characteristically, the measures proposed to remedy such imbalances involve policy shifts with respect both to trade and exchange regimes and also with regard to domestic pricing and investment policies. Despite the enormous diversity of conditions in Africa, this paper seeks to isolate some of the common strands that have marked adjustment policies in the recent period. The paper concentrates in particular on the agricultural sector and on Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, more detailed reference is given to the adjustment process in Senegal and Ghana. It is argued that most adjustment programmes, broadly defined, have, as regards agriculture, been mainly marked by their reliance on price reforms. This reflects in part the current enchantment among donors with prices and markets. Yet such emphasis is shown to be capable of yielding only partial solutions. In short, price policies need to be better adjusted to local conditions, incorporating social objectives and constraints, while also being complemented by a far greater emphasis on direct, non-price interventions. The key issue for African agriculture remains the raising of productivity levels for resource use and in production itself. While solutions will naturally tend to be developed on a country or sub-regional specific basis, the paper attempts to outline some of the ways in which the current limitations of adjustment programmes can be overcome at a more general level.||Simon Commander

If anything, the central sector plan allocations for agriculture, irrigation and rural development are lower in 1988-89 than in 1987-88. The finance minister has made somewhat larger budgetary provisions for improvement of rice production in eastern India, improvement in oilseeds production, help to small and marginal farmers, and on Command Area Development that may help a certain body of farmers in a limited way. On all other accounts the real budgetary provision is less than in the past. The tax concessions are confined to very limited number of potential beneficiaries. On the contrary, the interest rate policy, which is meant to provide an unsought benefit to a large body of farmers immediately, holds out ominous consequences for financial institutions and, if persisted with, will cost the cultivators dear.||Nilakantha Rath

Literacy is examined in relation to the levels for the corresponding male counterparts. Viewed thus, the sex and caste disparities that exist provide insights into biases affecting females and scheduled castes. These biases appear to vary along a north-south dimension. Finally, in order to interpret the pattern, a number of socio-economic correlates of female literacy such as presence of particular communities which foster female education or vice versa, and composition of work-force, are identified. The relative position of major localities, as far their literacy status is concerned, seems to be essentially the same as it has been since long. Whatever breakthrough is visible can be attributed to the actions of social movements.||S. Raju

These offsprings of gentlemen farmers are operating in an intermediate zone of agriculture and industry. They are eager to venture into the field of industrial capitalism. But the entry point in industry is uninviting and the future prospects dim. Under the new economic policy the economy is oriented towards the consumption pattern of the top decile of the population. Imports of technology, capital goods, and foreign capital are liberalised. The NEP would make India's economic development unstable, unequalising, and more crisis prone. Its impact on the newly emerging farmer-capitalists would be severe as they are under pressure from above as well as from below. They are threatened, in a shrinking market, by big capitalists including multinationals; on the other hand, they are confronted with the rising demands of workers, without enjoying the benefit of super profits. In any case, as simulations with Walrasian empirical general equilibrium models show the potential material gain from economic liberalisation is miniscule, if at all, hardly exceeding 0.3 per cent of GDP. The transition from cowdung capitalism cannot be accomplished through a policy that exacerbates dualism in the economy.||Ranjit Sau

These are all achievements that exceeded by far 'the best dreams of the early planners'. But in what measure have these investments and outputs mitigated the problems of poverty and unemployment?

The British system of non-fixed tenure of government and the 'winner takes all' type of territorial constituency based elections, together with the inability to evolve even after 38 years a healthy British type of two-party system, have given rise to extreme 'politics of confrontation' and special problems of union-state relations. Against this background, this paper argues that a time has come to give serious thought to modifying the position of the council of ministers that we have borrowed from Britain to one that obtains in Switzerland. The Swiss system has succeeded in providing Switzerland, which has a heterogeneous population and a two-tier system of government, a remarkably stable and efficient co-operative system of government. The Swiss system cannot obviously be adopted in its entirety in India because of some basic differences, but there are elements of it which, with suitable modification, could serve us better than the British system.||S.

13/8/1988- ||special articles||4378892||Roots of Uneven Regional Growth in India||The rate of public investment and consequently the rate of growth of production in the rich states will remain higher than in the poor ones, causing regional inequality to increase, unless the process is checked by transfer of adequate resources from the rich to the poor states. The implications of this formulation have been echoed sometimes in Finance Commission reports (more prominently in the notes of dissent) and also sometimes in reports of the Planning Commission, but its full implication has never been realised by the constitutional bodies and the institutions of the union government which are involved in the process of transfer of resources. The result is that the process of uneven regional growth continues unabated even after four decades of independence.||Pradhan H. Prasad

They have been excluded both as actors and as authors from featuring in history as they should and remain one of its most neglected subjects. The exercise of rewriting the past has been confined to invisibilising women: their presence has only been negatively registered, mainly through a vast silence. However, it is necessary to draw attention to the fact that while in general women have been invisible in historical writing this invisibility varies vastly over time and space according to differences in social and cultural practices. The Indian situation represents an example of the relative visibility of women in historical writing particularly with regard to 'ancient' India wherein historians created a certain space for women in the reconstruction of the past, but the space conceded to them existed only within clearly defined parameters as this review will show. In this paper we undertake, first, a broadly representative rather than comprehensive historiographical survey of studies on women in early India. The survey does not concentrate on factual details, important though these may be, but on the preconceived notions or assumptions which may have determined the kinds of facts considered historically relevant. Second, attention is paid to the kinds of explanations offered for changes in women's status. And finally we examine possible alternatives.||Uma Chakravarti,Kumkum Roy

This study indicates that the relationship between technology, modernisation and industrial performance is a complex one and all the participants in industry may not gain by it. The paper considers two strategic groups, namely, the public limited companies and the private limited companies and the results of the stuffy show that while expenditure on modernisation benefited the public limited companies they adversely affected the growth and performance of the private limited companies. It is important for policy-makers to explicitly take into account this differential impact on large and smaller firms and formulate appropriate measures such that the drive towards modernisation, which in practice has meant larger import of capital goods and equipment, does not adversely affect the performance of the smaller firms.||N.

While the green revolution brought to the fore the cultivating 'intermediary' caste as a political force and the birth of several regional parties, the peasant uprisings empowered dalits, adivasis and other backward castes and saw the rise of several militant mass organisations. The problematique of agrarian unrest in Bihar is viewed here in the context of this larger perspective. The article looks at the changing class configuration in the state, the role of the government and the ruling party, the land reforms programme and the caste factor in the evolution of peasant struggles.||Praveen K.

The issue of priority makes sense only with regard to the areas of overlap, and when Kalecki and Keynes advance essentially the same solution. The authors, on the other hand, emphasise the important differences between Kalecki and Keynes, both before and after the publication of the General Theory: in the handling of investment and in Kalecki's continued adherence to dynamic analysis; also in the treatment of finance and the monetary sector, in assumptions regarding the structure of product markets and pricing behaviour, in the types of aggregation employed. What we have are two basically different ways of approaching the aggregate behaviour of the capitalist economy and it is more profitable to begin with this recognition rather than get distracted from it by discussions of priority.||Aditya Bhattacharjea,N.

This essay reviews five sets of determinants of these variations: population pressure, geography, agrarian structure, cultural factors, and the role of the state. Rice irrigation in Asia often requires action above the level of the individual farm, and societies vary considerably in the success with which they have resolved the attendant problems of co-operation and conflict. A comparative analysis underscores the limitations of technocratic solutions to these problems, and points to the potential merits of strategies based upon democratisation of control over water resources.||James K.

This paper examines the development, policies and problems of the Indian power plant sector-here defined to include electricity supply and power plant production-in relation to the aims of promoting economic growth, import substitution, and international competitiveness. Particular attention is paid to Bharat heavy Electricals Ltd (BHEL), a public enterprise which was established with extensive technical assistance and loans from both east and west. Major difficulties were encountered-in assimilating technology acquired under numerous foreign licences; in coping with rapid technical change; in building up expertise in quality assurance, development and design engineering and research and development; in obtaining satisfactory materials and components from Indian firms; and in achieving satisfactory capacity utilisation. Nevertheless, in production capacity and size of market, BHEL is increasingly comparable to the ten or so suppliers that dominate the international market as well as their home markets in the US, Western Europe and Japan. The main challenge for the future is to achieve higher productivity of the capital employed in this sector by strengthening indigenous technological capabilities in all aspects of power engineering. This applies not only to the manufacture of power equipment, but also to the construction, operation, maintenance and repair of power stations.||John Surrey

This is done in response to the criticism levelled at theorists of cultural reproduction by 'resistance' theorists that their theory is deterministic and pessimistic in nature as it does not allow for individual intervention-resistance-and social change. The author argues that this is a limited view of cultural reproduction inasmuch as a careful reading of the work of Bourdieu, for example, indicates the possibilities for individual determination and 'contained' transformation, as it were. A critical consideration of certain key concepts central to Bourdieu's thesis, such as 'habitus', 'class', 'capital', and 'field', seeks to develop this argument contra that of resistance theory.||Meenakshi Thapan

From this assumption flowed the exponential decline in the rental of capital services. The value of a capital good was then determined as equal to the present value of such rentals after taking into account depreciation and other tax incentives. Conflicting results have, however, been obtained in testing the basic assumptions empirically. One of the reasons may be the absence of a theoretical framework for determining the value of a capital good. An attempt is made in this paper to construct such a theoretical framework based on the laws of thermodynamics.||Hrishikes Bhattacharya

The paper is divided into three sections. In Section I there is a discussion of the probable role of supply and demand factors in the determination of market clearing wage in the agrarian setting of Punjab and Haryana. A formal model of wage determination in terms of demand-supply factors is presented in Section II. The results obtained by applying our model to the district level data of Punjab and Haryana and certain conclusions and policy implications are discussed in Section III.||H. S. Sidhu

The contrary view is held rather as an axiomatic truth by historians and political scientists. This question is of major importance, for it is closely related to the questions about the class character of the Congress, the character of the movements waged by its leadership and the nature of the state or states that emerged in the Indian sub-continent in August, 1947.||Suniti Kumar Ghosh

23/7/1988- ||special articles||4378791||New Series on National Accounts Statistics: Some Comments||A careful examination of the CSO's New Series on National Accounts Statistics shows that the revisions in the estimates of gross domestic product are primarily for the unorganised sectors and revisions for consumption of fixed capital are for the public sector. The estimates of domestic product for some of the unorganised sectors have been revised upwards to an extent which is very difficult to accept because of the sudden sharp changes introduced. Also, many of these revisions are based on 'surmises' rather than the use of more recent data of sufficient reliability. In the case of measurement of consumption of fixed capital in the public sector in general and government administration in particular, more careful examination of the distinction between 'repairs and maintenance' and capital consumption is called for. This question is also directly linked with the measurement of saving in the public sector. Finally, there is the question of preparation of long-period series and comparability of the new estimates with past data. This is important because evaluation of the performance of the economy over the plan periods, economic and social analysis and economic decision-making are all linked with the availability of a consistent long-period series of National Accounts Statistics.||Uma Datta Roy Choudhury

The present paper is a critique of psychological research on women. An attempt has been made to show how psychology has dealt with women's issues in a tokenistic manner and how such research is based on questionable premises. Specifically, two themes of research which are most commonly indulged in by psychologists have been considered: (1) sex differences in a number of psychological variables and (2) sex role conflict.||U.

Further, the estimates reflect a thorough understanding of concepts and procedures involved in national income estimation and the presentation of the perpetual inventory method in particular is noteworthy. Yet the CSO has failed to evolve a procedural framework superior to the one used for the series with 1970-71 as base. This is partly because those who are responsible for the estimates are all specialists in producing numbers and not in using them to understand the economy and partly because they seem to have suffered from a craze for innovation and have introduced interesting novelties even when these affect long period comparability. As a result, despite some sectional improvements, the wood has been missed, at last partially, for the farmland trees.||M. Mukherjee

The paper identifies four critical dimensions of interventions by the state for the poor-employment generation, technology-extension-credit, assets and skills and welfare; for each dimension, the potentialities for and the limitations of the interventions by the state are briefly described with the help of findings and insights from the researches surveyed. The main argument of the paper is that in rural situations, as those in Karnataka, the interventions may be able to go beyond providing temporary relief to the poor. A set of relatively simple indicators is suggested for observing the developmental change brought about by the interventions. The paper discusses in some detail the perspective necessary for assessing the scope for inducing systemic changes through interventions for the poor. It also spells out the policy researches needed for effective designing, implementation and monitoring of these interventions.||V. M. Rao

Three such theoretical orientations, viz, theories of pluralism, middleman minority theory and the work of Rex, are briefly reviewed here. Pointing out their various shortcomings an attempt is made in this paper to construct a political economy and class-based conceptual framework which, in the author's view, more systematically explains the race relations situations of overseas Indians in numerous colonial/post-colonial societies.||Prakash C.

This paper examines the issues involved in the manner in which the Ninth Finance Commission has been called upon to approach its basic mandate of transfers under Articles 270, 272 and 275.

It reveals the existence of several segmented markets in the city's informal sector. The segments are not necessarily impermeable, but usually access is dependent on contacts, and acceptability by dominant groups controlling access routes. While the data reveals a steady inflow of the rural poor from eastern India, their destinations are well defined, and are usually based on information obtained from relations and kinsmen of the village. An average income of around Rs 80-100 per week can be earned by a physically strong village youth prepared to lift heavy loads in the congested wholesale commodities markets in the city, or tranship passengers across short distances in rickshaws. Contacts, kinship ties, caste and communal factors can ease access to these earning opportunities.

The theoretical framework draws heavily from the analytical models developed in Soviet ethnography, particularly the works of Yulian Bromley. However, to explain the ethnic complexities in India with its unique caste system and strong popular feelings about Indian 'nation', certain new concepts and terms are devised.||S. K. Acharya
22/10/1988- ||special articles||4379211||Integration and Exclusion in Indian Politics||The transition from a highly structured and institutionalised, inter-sectoral, inter-group and inter-elite framework of pluralist politics to a diffuse and unstructured and potentially malleable and homogenising mass politics, spurred by the growth of economic discontent and consciousness thereof, has opened the floodgates of populism on the one hand and a monolithic elite and reliance on charismatic power on the other. The two, it is argued here, are closely related; both are linked to a process of deinstitutionalising and ultimately depoliticising the conduct of public affairs. The new symbols of managing the public realm and the new types of promises and appeals have resulted in a model of nation-building and a rhetoric of national unity and national glory and power that have split the political community and accentuated the processes of polarisation, marginalisation and exclusion of the large mass of the people.||Rajni Kothari

In West Bengal it is exactly at such times that the trade unions have called strikes. Since the leaders of the 'left' unions are not novices in trade union struggle, the only possible inference is that these strikes are deliberately called in order to meet the needs of the owners. This conclusion is strengthened by the peculiar course of the recent strikes in public sector engineering and jute mills.||D. N.

For the future of the Indian federation, it is therefore essential that the current controversies over the terms of reference of the Ninth Finance Commission are resolved satisfactorily and solutions found to the problems which the working of the Finance Commissions in the past has given rise to or the terms of the Ninth Finance Commission are likely to create. For this purpose, it is necessary first to note the significant points of departure of the terms of reference of the present Finance Commission from those of the previous commissions and then to examine whether these departures are sustainable from the constitutional angle as also from the angles of equity and economic efficiency. This note seeks to present the issues arising out of the Ninth Finance Commission's terms of reference in this perspective.||Amaresh Bagchi,Tapas Sen,V. B. Tulasidhar

Due to their responsiveness to certain public policy interventions, such water markets have the potential to become powerful instruments for efficient and equitable ground water development. This paper presents an argument about how the working of such markets could be influenced and examines empirical evidence in two markedly similar villages selected from the west Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh and the Kheda district of Gujarat. The paper highlights the differential impact of public policies followed by the two states on the terms of business; and the output and livelihood intensities of ground water markets of these two villages.||Tushaar Shah,K.

This paper takes a retrospective look at the development of economic policy, in particular, industrial licensing and monopolies legislation, and practise over the last two decades. This approach lays bare the superficial character of the liberalisation process so far, which is being implemented in small doses. At most this may lead to a minor redistribution of power and incomes between the politicians/bureaucrats on the one side and the traders/industrialists/big farmers on the other.||H. K. Paranjape

This extremely loose structure allows a considerable freedom to spiritual masters and it explains to some extent how female ascetics have finally found their way into most of the monastic orders, even those traditionally closed to them. But to be admitted into a lineage does not allow one to transmit its religious tradition, that is to initiate and become a guru. It is only in some very rare cases that there is an evidence of self-sustained series of women ascetics. More often, female ascetics have to survive within the framework of systems that are essentially male-oriented and have been designed and refined by males for other males.||Catherine Clementin-Ojha

Since the apparent success of the new strategy has been cited in support of the plea for further cuts in tax rates and the question of effective enforcement of income tax is important for the community's confidence in the fairness of the tax system, it is necessary to see objectively whether the new strategy has really paid off and can be depended upon for the future. For this purpose, one has to take a close look at what has actually been achieved by the reforms in terms of revenue buoyancy, that is, examine whether the growth in the tax revenue that has actually taken place marks a distinct break with the past, before proceeding to look for the likely causes. This note is an attempt to study statistically whether the spurt in income tax revenues since 1985-86 can be regarded as significant and examine in that light the soundness of some of the components of the new strategy.||Amaresh Bagchi

02/7/1988- ||special articles||4378705||The Farmer-Capitalists of Coastal Andhra Pradesh||This paper traces the rise of a new class of businessmen out of the class of capitalist farmers in coastal Andhra Pradesh and explores some of its social and economic characteristics. The emergence of this class is explained by reference to the convergence of several historical processes: the development of a productive and commercialised agrarian economy in the late nineteenth century and the emergence of a 'rich peasant' class, the integration of town and countryside, an early interest in education on the part of the rural elite, the politicisation of caste identity and, later, the green revolution and land reforms. High productivity and profit rates in agriculture have contributed to the development of capitalist tendencies in the system of agricultural production, and the 'capitalist farmers' are accumulating surpluses which they seek to invest in ever more profitable enterprises. The result has been a pattern of urban migration and economic diversification among the rural elite which, over several generations, has produced the new urban business class. The paper is being published in two parts. This, the first, part provides a brief sketch of the history of the region and the roots of the new capitalist class and describes some characteristics of the rural elite in the region based on the results of village studies. The second part of the paper, to appear next week, will present the results of a survey of urban-based businessmen coming from the rural elite and discuss the reasons for the development of a rural-based capitalist class in the area and some of the theoretical implications of this development.||Carol Boyack Upadhya

This paper first traces recent developments in international banking and finance and then assesses the past performance of Indian banks overseas and their future prospects. The author concludes that unless prompt measures are taken to consolidate the overseas operations of all Indian banks in order to develop a few viable banking units abroad, there is a danger of being overwhelmed by the revolutionary changes taking place in the international banking world.||S.

Resource demands of the process have undermined the productive potential of natural resources and have created severe ecological instability. It is in this context that ecology movements have emerged and are throwing up indicators to assess the impact of development process on natural resources, their uses and how the cost and benefits they carry are distributed among different societal groups.

Certain areas have been identified as industrially backward and special schemes have been formulated to induce the development of industry there. Direct government intervention is a necessary condition for diverting industry from industrially developed areas to industrially backward regions. However, factors which are likely to be equally important in decisions on industrial location are the availability of transport, communications, water, power, social amenities and other services. The formulation of an effective industrial location policy requires an understanding of the factors inducing location in industrially backward regions. This paper is an attempt to analyse such factors in the case of Maharashtra and Gujarat.||Jyotsna Paranjape

On the other hand, however, there is still almost complete absence of women as candidates in the panchayat elections.

Economic growth is inadequate and much of it has been neutralised by population. Economic development, financed mainly by borrowing, both internal and external, does not create sufficient funds to repay the loans and the burden of debt grows. Deficit financing generates inflationary pressures causing not only economic debility but also political instability. Sectoral and regional disparities grow and become politically untenable. Most probably these problems will remain as India enters the 21st Century.||V. M. Dandekar

Before 1973, such a strike would have been inconceivable. After the experience of 1987, it has become clear that while an all-India strike can be called for a limited duration, an indefinite strike cannot perhaps be sustained. Implicit in these remarks are several related issues like the roles of the UGC, the department of education, the state governments and the state of maturity and professionalism at which the teachers' movement is situated today. Each one of these factors played a role in this complex drama of the 1987 strike. In order to understand the future of higher education in the country, it is important to understand their respective roles and what potential, for good or mischief, they hold for the future.||Amrik Singh

Besides this, among the factors that permit the farmer to increase his marketable surplus the most important one is his family size. If the family size is big, the marketable surplus will be relatively lower, even for the big-sized farms. Per capita availability of cultivated land among the larger farms is certainly higher compared to the smaller ones, but per capita availability of land under a specific crop need not be higher in the larger size groups than the smaller farms. The phenomenon of marketable surplus should be examined not in terms of size-classes of holdings but with the acreage of individual crops separately against each size-class.||Manabendu Chattopadhyay,Ipsita Sen

The discussion on the trends in the economic condition of agricultural labour households is placed in the context of the debate on the changes in the conditions of agricultural labourers. Another related concern is how the Worker-Population Ratios (WPR) of these labour households are affected by the large increase in the percentage of agricultural labour households and the changing economic conditions of these households over the period. In other words, is the entry of women into the workforce influenced by the changing economic position of these households?||Jeemol Unni

One of these would tell the story of structures-of the rise of capitalism, the specificities of transition, the formation and maturation of classes, the internal balance and architecture of the social form, the making and breaking of class coalitions, etc. The other story would have to be constructed in terms of actual political actors, suspending the question of more fundamental causalities for the time being; it must be told in terms of governments, parties, tactics, leaders, political movements, and similar contingent but irreplaceable elements of political narratives. The second story would be related to the successes of Indian capitalism and its failures, but is not entirely reducible to them. This paper tries to show what kind of a political model might work in the structural analysis of Indian politics.||Sudipta Kaviraj

This discourse did not recognise that within the so-called 'Hindu' fold are a number of communities and ethnic groups with their own strong self-identity and socio-cultural patterns. As a response to questions raised by women's studies about the realities of women's lives and the basis of allocation of roles and status in society, there is growing awareness of the need to understand better these smaller communities and groups. These existing alternative models provide evidence that the legitimated and dominant pattern of female subordination is neither a truth for all times nor an unalterable 'natural' law.||Veena Poonacha

He has benefited certain well known friends of his party in industry. But most of all he has been able to produce a 'pro kisan' budget without doing all that much for the kisan.

27/8/1988- ||special articles||4378966||A Theory of Underdeveloped Capitalism: The Case of India||Since the days of physiocrats in mid-18th century it is recognised that the course of an economy depends upon production, distribution and utilisation of the 'net product', or 'economic surplus', defined as the excess of national income over the wage bill. A distinguishing feature of underdeveloped capitalism, in comparison with developed capitalism, is that the surplus is transformed, not into simply profits, but into several significantly different components: ground rent, ordinary profit, and super profit. This makes the political economy of underdeveloped capitalism quite complex in that there are conflicts of interest among a multiplicity of classes-workers and peasants, landlords, ordinary capitalists, and monopoly capitalists. This paper shows that under certain conditions a rise in the super profit in one activity may increase that in other activities, while it lowers the rate of ordinary profit everywhere. The new economic policy of liberalisation in India, if it strengthens the presence of foreign multinational corporations, might benefit the domestic monopoly capitalists, but it would hurt the small capitalists and thus thwart the transition of India into the higher stage of capitalism, contrary to the official objective.||Ranjit Sau

The nature and extent of participation by small farmers in the commodity market as sellers and also other related issues like the question of distress sales are the focus of analysis. There is an attempt to find whether there is price bias in favour of any particular class of farmers who come to the market to sell their produce and whether these price advantages/disadvantages are specific to particular crops or choice of market outlets. The study finds no conclusive evidence to support the view that small farmers are paid less for their produce than those offered to big farmers or that there is any conscious and deliberate attempt at price discrimination against them in the commodity market. It further notes that price differentials across size-classes were smaller when the market outlet was a co-operative as against an agent.||K. N. Ninan

The commission should suggest expenditure norms which the union government should adhere to and recommend the distribution of a large part of the amount that is to devolve on the states under Section 280, reserving Section 282 grants for disasters and other such unexpected events. A very useful fall-out of such an arrangement will be that the Planning Commission will then have to become a genuinely expert advisory body. It will not have the clout of 'plan-grants' to enforce the patterns of development which it and the various union ministries think appropriate for all the states. Only on the basis of its genuine expertise will it be able to influence state governments, not through its financial clout.||H. K. Paranjape

First, it is shown that the connection between efficiency and exploitation in backward agriculture has been widely misunderstood, but this can be sorted out by resorting to some simple theory. Secondly, the subject of rental laws is a source of much confusion but, again, abstract reasoning can help us understand many of the issues involved. The popular view that the existing rental laws are 'pro-tenant' is examined and some suggestions are made for policy reform.||Kaushik Basu

Total government expenditure will increase, the non-plan component increasing faster and the non-developmental part increasing faster still. Large loans will be taken not for creating productive assets but for revenue expenditure. The overall deficit financed by Reserve Bank credit will increase. If availability of foodgrains and other essentials do not rise at the desired rate, the result will be inflationary pressures. Mounting debt service charges will put severe pressure on the balance of payments. The state governments will be hamstrung by shortage of financial resources, after meeting their own debt service charges.||Bhabatosh Datta

And, unfortunately, all the researches that have been carried out by his followers during the last hundred years have not advanced the matter much in this respect. Further harm has been done by Marxist scholars dividing themselves into two groups-one highlighting sources which may be termed internal and the other emphasising those which can be called external, but both sides relying more on speculation than on hard facts. The author's examination of the different sources that possibly contributed to the accumulation of capital in the period prior to the industrial revolution leads to the conclusion that the sources of funds cannot be quantified or even properly identified.||Sutapa Bose

Very different in tone from the Raj revivals, it nonetheless suggests the bad old days of the British Raj, not in its direct allusions to colonial history, but in its appropriation of non-western material within an orientalist framework of thought and action, which has been specifically designed for the international market.

09/7/1988- ||special articles||4378736||The Farmer-Capitalists of Coastal Andhra Pradesh||This paper traces the rise of a new class of businessmen out of the class of capitalist farmers in coastal Andhra Pradesh and explores some of its social and economic characteristics. The emergence of this class is explained by reference to the convergence of several historical processes: the development of a productive and commercialised agrarian economy in the late nineteenth century and the emergence of a 'rich peasant' class, the integration of town and countryside, an early interest in education on the part of the rural elite, the politicisation of caste identity and, later, the green revolution and land reforms. High productivity and profit rates in agriculture have contributed to the development of capitalist tendencies in the system of agricultural production, and the 'capitalist farmers' are accumulating surpluses which they seek to invest in ever more profitable enterprises. The result has been a pattern of urban migration and economic diversification among the rural elite which, over several generations, has produced the new urban business class. This paper has been published in two parts. This, the second and concluding, part presents the results of a survey of urban-based businessmen coming from the rural elite and discusses the reasons for the development of a rural-based capitalist class in the area and some of the theoretical implications of this development. The first part of the paper, published last week, provided a brief sketch of the region studied and the roots of the new capitalist class and discussed some characteristics of the rural elite in the region based on the results of village studies.||Carol Boyak Upadhya

They are the tremendous void created in the availability of skilled people at all levels and in all fields by the sudden mass departure of the Portuguese settlers in 1975-76, the destabilisation and destruction caused by the undeclared war by South Africa and its Angolan proteges the UNITA rebels, and the halving of Angola's foreign exchange income within one year (1986) due to the collapse of the oil prices on the world market. The response of the Angolan government to these three shocks has been firstly to take the control and guidance of the economy into its own hands, secondly to encourage investment by foreign capital and import of western technology, thirdly to rapidly create skilled cadres by sending Angolan students abroad for higher education and technical training, and fourthly to retain skilled people within Angola by offering appropriate incentives. The paper analyses these issues within the context of the present deep economic and social crises affecting Angola, and within the framework of the socialist intentions and ideology of the Angolan state.||M.

The project studied is a fairly large and complex one, based on commercially unproven and new technology-and hence with considerable potential risks as well as direct and indirect benefits, arising from adaptive technological research, not only to India but to several other LDCs growing sugarcane. It is directly linked and interrelated with agriculture as well as the sugar industry. Thus, no private enterprise was willing to select, implement and operate a project of such complexity. Such was the rationale for public enterprise in this sector. The case study also illustrates the several preconditions essential for the success of such a public enterprise. First, it indicates the significance of having plurality of public enterprise promoters or sponsors; this generates healthy competition and makes experimentation with new ideas possible. Second, it pinpoints the importance of high-level support and commitment, which makes it possible to institutionalise the decision structure and processes, essential for the effective and efficient functioning of a public enterprise. Third, it indicates the type of relationship of partnership, essential in a mixed economy, between the public and the private sectors. Fourth, it draws attention to the nature and characteristics of functional interlinkages, essential for identifying and selecting an appropriate technology as well as identifying and undertaking technological research for improving such technology. Finally, it illustrates the vital significance of entrepreneurial ability-the ability to identify a project idea and the will power, tenacity and drive to implement it in spite of obstacles of all types.||V.

The first two parts of the paper highlight the nature of the political, economic and ideological development of the Indian bourgeoisie in the colonial period as well as certain trends in the colonial economy before 1947. The actual trends that have emerged in the Indian economy since independence as a result of the specific path of development that has been followed are outlined in the third part. Part four discusses certain other factors which are crucial to the path of development followed, viz, the nature of the hegemonic ideology in the Indian national movement as well as in Indian society after independence, the role of political democracy, the balance of class forces since independence, the role of the state and the public sector and the size of the Indian home market.

At the firm level, the 'make-buy' decision is a function of technology and conditions of profitability. The author makes an attempt to assess the calculus whether to vertically integrate or subcontract to small firms as also the inducements that have made small firms enter into contractual ties with Keltron. The subcontractors development has been found to be a function of the terms and conditions set, how they have been actually implemented or violated and their capabilities in overcoming their own labour, product, process and market specificities/inflexibilities. Although the subcontracting relationship appears to be based on mutual interests, it is largely unsymbiotic as far as the subcontractors are concerned. The relationship has been found to be ultimately beneficial to Keltron.||J. C. B. Annavajhula

Going by the evidence of the commission's first report, it has done no such thing.||A. M.

The focus is on the nature of the labour processes used within the enterprises, the means of control exercised over the workers and the political relations of the owners or managers with the state apparatus. Specific cases of the retardation of the productive forces and the adoption of regressive labour processes are presented. The paper may be looked upon as an agenda for research as well as a contribution to the debate on the nature of colonial society.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

The author first discusses the data sources and the methodology followed. Thereafter he proceeds to the main findings on the movement of wages over time, their dispersion across states and gender groups within the agricultural labour force. In the second part of the study there is an attempt to explain temporal movements and spatial and gender disparities observed in the wage rates.||A. V. Jose

But now a time has come when mere adaptive mixing of traditional and modern business practices may no longer suffice. Their adaptive orientation may handicap them from thinking about radical solutions that are required to solve contemporary problems. The shift in government policies, the increasing alienation among middle-level managers, the highly result-oriented and active trade unionism and modern technological compulsions require a more open and participative corporate culture.||M.

18/6/1988- ||special articles||4378637||Price Competitiveness of Indian Manufacturing Industry||The main focus of this paper is on relative price structure and price behaviour-price levels and price movements in India vis-a-vis other countries. The authors were prompted to make a comparative analysis in the light of the alleged notion that prices in this country are higher than foreign prices. Recently, international agencies have pushed this notion to such an extent that they are suggesting a further devaluation of the Indian rupee: Investigations at the detailed commodity level reveal a tendency of home prices to drift downwards at least for the seventies and the beginning of the eighties when compared with foreign price movements. Thus India's poor export performance does not represent a competitiveness problem per se. Instead, one might readily account for this in non-price factors, some of which are external factors. It appears that strait-jacket prescriptions such as exchange rate adjustment are unrealistic and misplaced; instead, better results can be achieved if reliance is placed on selective measures.||R. G.
