Cost of cultivation data can be used to estimate parameters of the demand for pesticides. On the supply side, given the sheltered nature of the domestic market, there is need to develop policies towards the pricing of pesticides. Account has also to be taken of the development of more effective and newer pesticides, many of which are also environmentally less harmful.||Yoginder K. Alagh

For some it is a vital factor of production in their economic pursuits; while for some others it is merely a barricade for privacy in a highly congested urban environment. There is also another category of urban poor who live and earn their living with no form of shelter whatsoever. This study analyses the factors influencing the decisions of such truely shelterless persons living on the pavements of Calcutta city. The first section of the paper describes the data sources and survey methodology and presents a picture of the size, nature and magnitude of the problem. The second section analyses the economic characteristics of the pavement-dwellers, who as a class can be considered as the poorest of the urban poor. The third section examines the income-shelter linkages, and the fourth section seeks to derive some policy conclusions.||N. Vijay Jagannathan,Animesh Halder

While the problems of the composite sector in the older textile centres are predominantly the result of structural and environmental factors, it is also a fact that managements of textile mills suffered from static perceptions about the industry relating to raw material, technology, products and markets. These perceptions were conditioned by the general environment of a closed and highly protected economy and led to slow responses to market changes at the unit management level. Many of these problems were identified and accepted by the Expert Committee on Textiles and found expression in the new Textile Policy announced in June 1985. While lately there appears to be a greater desire to implement the new Textile Policy with some vigour, further macro-level remedial steps have to be taken. The major ones among these are discussed here as are managerial actions that have to be taken at the unit level. And even as the textile units implement the required strategy in the new environment, support will have to be provided to the sick units till they become healthy, calling for exercise of judgment on the viability of the unit, commitment and competence of the management and the need for funds and financial accommodation.||Prafull Anubhai

The phenomenon is attributed to ill-conceived development of critical factors such as water management and land development which has been exacerbated by increasing environmental degradation.||K. P.

This paper attempts to suggest an analytical framework for understanding the causes of ecological degradation in the context of the changing crop and livestock economy as well as the impact of these two on rural poverty.||C.

It is also necessary to fashion a path of agrarian development different from the imperialist-sponsored Green Revolution; a path of agrarian development that relies on the peasantry, promotes technological self-reliance and is ecologically balanced.||D.

11/6/1988- ||special articles||4378609||Political Economy of Ecology Movements||Development activity in India has proceeded on a resource-intensive path. It has seriously disrupted ecological stability of life support systems which has been maintained through centuries. Resource demands of the process have undermined the productive potential of natural resources and have created severe ecological instability. It is in this context that ecology movements have emerged and are throwing up indicators to assess the impact of development process on natural resources, their uses and how the cost and benefits they carry are distributed among different societal groups. This paper attempts to systematise and provide a conceptual framework for understanding the development process and its structural features from the ecological perspective.||Jayanta Bandyopadhyay,Vandana Shiva
