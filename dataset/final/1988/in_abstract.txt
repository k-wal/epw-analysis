A widespread movement is emerging today in protest against the state's forest policy and the increasing commercialisation of common resources.||Paul Kurian

17/9/1988- ||special articles||4379055||Pesticides in Indian Agriculture||This paper argues that it is now possible to introduce a systems approach to the use of modern pesticides in Indian agriculture. Cost of cultivation data can be used to estimate parameters of the demand for pesticides. On the supply side, given the sheltered nature of the domestic market, there is need to develop policies towards the pricing of pesticides. Account has also to be taken of the development of more effective and newer pesticides, many of which are also environmentally less harmful.||Yoginder K. Alagh

For some it is a vital factor of production in their economic pursuits; while for some others it is merely a barricade for privacy in a highly congested urban environment. There is also another category of urban poor who live and earn their living with no form of shelter whatsoever. This study analyses the factors influencing the decisions of such truely shelterless persons living on the pavements of Calcutta city. The first section of the paper describes the data sources and survey methodology and presents a picture of the size, nature and magnitude of the problem. The second section analyses the economic characteristics of the pavement-dwellers, who as a class can be considered as the poorest of the urban poor. The third section examines the income-shelter linkages, and the fourth section seeks to derive some policy conclusions.||N. Vijay Jagannathan,Animesh Halder

While the problems of the composite sector in the older textile centres are predominantly the result of structural and environmental factors, it is also a fact that managements of textile mills suffered from static perceptions about the industry relating to raw material, technology, products and markets. These perceptions were conditioned by the general environment of a closed and highly protected economy and led to slow responses to market changes at the unit management level. Many of these problems were identified and accepted by the Expert Committee on Textiles and found expression in the new Textile Policy announced in June 1985. While lately there appears to be a greater desire to implement the new Textile Policy with some vigour, further macro-level remedial steps have to be taken. The major ones among these are discussed here as are managerial actions that have to be taken at the unit level. And even as the textile units implement the required strategy in the new environment, support will have to be provided to the sick units till they become healthy, calling for exercise of judgment on the viability of the unit, commitment and competence of the management and the need for funds and financial accommodation.||Prafull Anubhai

This essay reviews five sets of determinants of these variations: population pressure, geography, agrarian structure, cultural factors, and the role of the state. Rice irrigation in Asia often requires action above the level of the individual farm, and societies vary considerably in the success with which they have resolved the attendant problems of co-operation and conflict. A comparative analysis underscores the limitations of technocratic solutions to these problems, and points to the potential merits of strategies based upon democratisation of control over water resources.||James K.

Due to their responsiveness to certain public policy interventions, such water markets have the potential to become powerful instruments for efficient and equitable ground water development. This paper presents an argument about how the working of such markets could be influenced and examines empirical evidence in two markedly similar villages selected from the west Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh and the Kheda district of Gujarat. The paper highlights the differential impact of public policies followed by the two states on the terms of business; and the output and livelihood intensities of ground water markets of these two villages.||Tushaar Shah,K.

It has seriously disrupted ecological stability of life support systems which has been maintained through centuries. Resource demands of the process have undermined the productive potential of natural resources and have created severe ecological instability. It is in this context that ecology movements have emerged and are throwing up indicators to assess the impact of development process on natural resources, their uses and how the cost and benefits they carry are distributed among different societal groups. This paper attempts to systematise and provide a conceptual framework for understanding the development process and its structural features from the ecological perspective.||Jayanta Bandyopadhyay,Vandana Shiva
13/2/1988- ||special articles||4378109||Inducing Industrial Location in Backward Regions: A Study of Maharashtra and Gujarat||Since the early seventies, greater emphasis has been given to the objective of balanced regional development in industrial policy. Certain areas have been identified as industrially backward and special schemes have been formulated to induce the development of industry there. Direct government intervention is a necessary condition for diverting industry from industrially developed areas to industrially backward regions. However, factors which are likely to be equally important in decisions on industrial location are the availability of transport, communications, water, power, social amenities and other services. The formulation of an effective industrial location policy requires an understanding of the factors inducing location in industrially backward regions. This paper is an attempt to analyse such factors in the case of Maharashtra and Gujarat.||Jyotsna Paranjape

For example, is groundwater irrigation much more production augmenting than canal irrigation? If so, should emphasis be placed on the development of groundwater resources rather than major irrigation works? There is a discussion of the kind of changes in the crop pattern that need to be fostered in order to enhance the productivity of irrigation. The extent of drought proofing provided by irrigation, the effect of irrigation on the stability of agricultural production and the factors influencing inequality of income gains from irrigation between small and large farms are discussed. Finally, policy implications are spelt out.||B. D. Dhawan
