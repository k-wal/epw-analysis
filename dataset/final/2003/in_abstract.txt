It is clear that countries like India will be affected by any global architecture for greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement that emerges. Despite near-term uncertainty about the size of the clean development mechanism market and the price of certified emissions reductions (CERs), it is very likely that India will be a major player. In the long run India along with other developing countries may take on some commitments especially where emissions trading may be an important component of the GHG abatement architecture. It is, however, important that we understand and address the problems in using a market-based approach to environmental management in India, particularly with respect to monitoring and enforcement.||Shreekant Gupta

While a purely judicial approach to environmental management is neither effective nor efficient, PIL has played a significant role in defining India's pollution management system.||Aparna Sawhney

Worldwide Displacement of Democratic Judgment by Expert Assessments||The present era can be called the 'Age of Scientific Assessment'. Governments on both sides of the Atlantic, intergovernmental organisations, NGOs, and private firms have all increasingly resorted to a variety of techniques, such as probabilistic risk analysis, pollution dispersion models, urban planning models, traffic-flow models, dose-response curves, and so on, ostensibly to guide the prudent use of resources to generate social and welfare and, increasingly, the natural environment. At the same time that the span of technocratic assessment has expanded, there has been a disconcerting decline in electoral participation in many industrialised countries. This paper suggests that there is a direct link between these two phenomena. Critics suggest that the science informing such assessments should be subjected to effective democratic participation and control. Social scientists have responded to this situation by designing ingenious ways to reconcile the conflicting demands of technical competence in making scientific judgments with popular participation in assessment and decision-making processes. Such techniques individualise values and represent the challenge of democracy as that of aggregating individual preferences. The paper opens the question whether these techniques are really the solution or, perhaps, might be part of the problem. It suggests that an answer to this question requires a radical rethink of our ideas about the institutions of science, democracy, and resource management.||Steve Rayner

While recent reform initiatives too formed a theme, the inability of economic thinking to attend to emerging ecological concerns also formed a conference theme.||Arup Kumar Sen

Rise in human and livestock population and development of modern agriculture have led to degradation of land and environment. If unchecked, the land resource may become increasingly less productive and may get irreversibly damaged. It is important therefore that a systematic data base is built to assess changes in land use and the type and extent of environmental damage to land resource. This paper describes the existing system for generating land use data and shows that it is not adequate to enable environmental assessment of land use. It makes a case for technological advancement and institutional changes to improve the land use data base in the country.||Sudarshan Iyengar

This paper critically reviews the concept of 'environmental security' and examines the assumptions underlying debates around environmental conflicts from the perspective of political ecology and global political economy. It argues that attention to the specificities of local contexts must be combined with an appreciation of the continued salience of the structures of imperial knowledge and power.||Simon Dalby

Fishing and shrimp culture operations now rely overwhelmingly on informal credit structures which have in turn led to increasing indebtedness and the lake itself is shrinking gradually because of siltation and environmental damage.||Kishor C.

The study attempts to examine the consequences of socio-economic and environmental factors in terms of income, literacy, sanitation and hygiene for morbidity. The needs of the urban poor and their priorities are seen to be hierarchial. They need first assurance of being allowed to stay where they are and then provision of basic amenities of toilets, water supply, sewerage and drainage.||Sunil Kumar Karn,Shigeo Shikura,Hideki Harada
29/11/2003-05/12/2003||special articles||4414348||Natural Resources and Capitalist Frontiers||The late 20th century saw the creation of new 'resource frontiers' in every corner of the world. Made possible by cold war militarisation of the third world and the growing power of corporate transnationalism, resource frontiers grew up where entrepreneurs and armies were able to disengage nature from its previous ecologies, making the natural resources that bureaucrats and generals could offer as corporate raw material. From a distance, these new resource frontiers appeared as the 'discovery' of global supplies in forests, tundras, coastal seas, or mountain fastnesses. Up close, they replaced existing systems of human access and livelihood and ecological dynamics of replenishment with the cultural apparatus of capitalist expansion. This essay explores the making of a resource frontier in the eastern part of South Kalimantan, Indonesia, in the 1990s.||Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing

What are the distinct factors responsible for this unique development in hybrid rice R and D in Vietnam - which has similar agro-ecological, political, socio-economic and institutional features as China? Would hybrid rice adoption be sustained in the long run in Vietnam? This paper reviews the development of hybrid rice in the country in the context of the development of the overall rice economy. It reports the findings of a sample farm household survey on the profitability of cultivating hybrid rice over the inbred high-yielding varieties.||Mahabub Hossain,Tran Thi Ut,Aldas Janaiah

Land degradation occurs mainly in the form of water-induced soil erosion, though agrochemical and wind erosion have also made an impact. This paper seeks to measure the extent of damage due to land degradation of various types and their expected trends in the future. Besides examining trends in land-use pattern across states and estimating the extent and costs of degradation, it also explores the linkages between degradation and policy and institutional environment in the context of agro-climatic regional planning.||V.

The development of Karur as an industrial district demonstrates how the spontaneous reproposal of processes that are well known in the European sphere, but which reflect systemic traditions strongly connected with a production system that is 'anchored' to quite definite localisms, highlights the existence of multiple modernities. One effect of this process is a general 'diffusion of possibilities' in the local social tissue for those who are able and know how to exploit them. The small units also manage to provide concrete answers to the problem of unemployment among the most disadvantaged social classes. Manifestations of the 'high road', that is the competition between the units based on the constant attempt to bring improvements to the products is evident; but so is the 'low road' with high social costs: Precarious working conditions, exploitation of the workers, low cost labour, few innovations, relatively low quality of the products, environmental pollution.||Marco Corsi

A focus on the complex material and symbolic dimensions of how 'natural resources' come to be imagined, appropriated and contested, enables one to move away from the dull rigours of economic determinism that dog political ecology. The conceptual strengths of this approach also enrich political practice. This introductory essay delineates some of the contours of cultural politics and situates the following essays within its rubric, organising the discussion around prominent keywords used in discourses around natural resources.||Amita Baviskar

The nature of the relative impact of rail and road transport suggests that a number of factors have to be given due consideration in the formulation of transport policy: category of traffic, type of traction on rail, type of passenger movement on road, and the trade-off between greater energy efficiency and greater environmental damage potential.||Prosenjit Dey Chaudhury

Scholars, policy-makers and activists would thus do well to abandon the idea that national maps alone constitute the geography of modernity.||David Ludden

A proper review of the project must assess both its technical feasibility and whether the costs of increasing effective supply (including environmental and rehabilitation costs) by augmentation through interlinking is commensurate with the benefits by way of increased production. It must also be examined whether there is scope for improving efficiency of use beyond what is assumed, what the costs and benefits would be and how they will compare with those of interlinking.||A.

Seeking full membership in the European Union was probably the only policy principle upon which all members of the post-state-socialist political elite agreed initially. The only audible opposition to the country's EU-membership today comes from the right and for all the wrong reasons. Social and environmental considerations, whether domestic or global, are completely absent from this ambivalent, nationalist resistance to the EU.||József Böröcz

Most developing countries are net importers of these products. However, the Indian environmental industry is still in its infancy and if appropriately developed and offered some protection, could gain access to markets abroad.||Sandeep Singh

Demolishing a Myth||This paper, citing evidence from the ancient scriptures, attempts to establish that Hinduism - its vedic and classic variants - did not support the caste system; it rigorously opposed it in practice and principle. Even after the emergence of the caste system, Hindu society still saw considerable occupational and social mobility. Moreover, Hinduism created legends to impress on the popular mind the invalidity of the caste system - a fact further reinforced by the constant efflorescence of reform movements throughout history. The caste system survived in spite of this because of factors that ranged from the socio-economic to the ecological, which helped sustain and preserve balance among communities in a non-modern world.||M.

Its fourfold typology of forms of social solidarity is able to make explicit the different social constructions of nature, physical and human, on which environmental debate is premised. This paper applies cultural theory to the 'policy stories' around climate change and makes the case for 'clumsy' institutional arrangements that forgo elegance to accommodate the diversity of social solidarities, harnessing contestation to constructive, if noisy, argumentation.||Michael Thompson
