More worrying is the spate of preacquisition land transactions that it has prompted. This is resulting in land transfers to outsiders who aim to gain by selling land to the Uranium Corporation of India (UCIL) later on, and to access compensations in various forms.||R. Uma Maheshwari

It is clear that countries like India will be affected by any global architecture for greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement that emerges. Despite near-term uncertainty about the size of the clean development mechanism market and the price of certified emissions reductions (CERs), it is very likely that India will be a major player. In the long run India along with other developing countries may take on some commitments especially where emissions trading may be an important component of the GHG abatement architecture. It is, however, important that we understand and address the problems in using a market-based approach to environmental management in India, particularly with respect to monitoring and enforcement.||Shreekant Gupta

Worldwide Displacement of Democratic Judgment by Expert Assessments||The present era can be called the 'Age of Scientific Assessment'. Governments on both sides of the Atlantic, intergovernmental organisations, NGOs, and private firms have all increasingly resorted to a variety of techniques, such as probabilistic risk analysis, pollution dispersion models, urban planning models, traffic-flow models, dose-response curves, and so on, ostensibly to guide the prudent use of resources to generate social and welfare and, increasingly, the natural environment. At the same time that the span of technocratic assessment has expanded, there has been a disconcerting decline in electoral participation in many industrialised countries. This paper suggests that there is a direct link between these two phenomena. Critics suggest that the science informing such assessments should be subjected to effective democratic participation and control. Social scientists have responded to this situation by designing ingenious ways to reconcile the conflicting demands of technical competence in making scientific judgments with popular participation in assessment and decision-making processes. Such techniques individualise values and represent the challenge of democracy as that of aggregating individual preferences. The paper opens the question whether these techniques are really the solution or, perhaps, might be part of the problem. It suggests that an answer to this question requires a radical rethink of our ideas about the institutions of science, democracy, and resource management.||Steve Rayner

Rise in human and livestock population and development of modern agriculture have led to degradation of land and environment. If unchecked, the land resource may become increasingly less productive and may get irreversibly damaged. It is important therefore that a systematic data base is built to assess changes in land use and the type and extent of environmental damage to land resource. This paper describes the existing system for generating land use data and shows that it is not adequate to enable environmental assessment of land use. It makes a case for technological advancement and institutional changes to improve the land use data base in the country.||Sudarshan Iyengar

Made possible by cold war militarisation of the third world and the growing power of corporate transnationalism, resource frontiers grew up where entrepreneurs and armies were able to disengage nature from its previous ecologies, making the natural resources that bureaucrats and generals could offer as corporate raw material. From a distance, these new resource frontiers appeared as the 'discovery' of global supplies in forests, tundras, coastal seas, or mountain fastnesses. Up close, they replaced existing systems of human access and livelihood and ecological dynamics of replenishment with the cultural apparatus of capitalist expansion. This essay explores the making of a resource frontier in the eastern part of South Kalimantan, Indonesia, in the 1990s.||Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing

Viewed from a wider perspective of neoliberal capitalist expansion, the creation of a global proletariat is facilitated by the dismantling of customary relations to land, forest and water. The fact that many dams throughout the world are located in territories in which existing populations hold legally tenuous relations to the environment may not be a coincidence. Further, existing laws and planning policies related to dam developments share a worldview that meshes utilitarian logic and legal belief in private property with an abstract concept of space and the environment.||Judy Whitehead

The growth centres provide basic industrial infrastructure like power, water, telecom and banking to enable the states to attract industries. This paper attempts to assess qualitatively the performance of the growth centres on the basis of primary data collected from field visits to several centres, discussion with state governments and visits to several firms located in the growth centres. It is found that without the infrastructure provided by the growth centre, many firms (even some representing local entrepreneurship) would not have located where they are. The firms have a favourable impact on the local labour markets. A few of the firms export and some contribute socially to the local communities. The paper concludes with recommendations for policy at the firm-level and the growth centre-level.||Kala Seetharam Sridhar

The development of Karur as an industrial district demonstrates how the spontaneous reproposal of processes that are well known in the European sphere, but which reflect systemic traditions strongly connected with a production system that is 'anchored' to quite definite localisms, highlights the existence of multiple modernities. One effect of this process is a general 'diffusion of possibilities' in the local social tissue for those who are able and know how to exploit them. The small units also manage to provide concrete answers to the problem of unemployment among the most disadvantaged social classes. Manifestations of the 'high road', that is the competition between the units based on the constant attempt to bring improvements to the products is evident; but so is the 'low road' with high social costs: Precarious working conditions, exploitation of the workers, low cost labour, few innovations, relatively low quality of the products, environmental pollution.||Marco Corsi

While manufactured through political and policy processes, a combination of socio-political, discursive and institutional factors, water scarcity is experienced in terms of real, tangible effects. By focusing on the case of 'water-scarce' Kutch and its relationship with the controversial Sardar Sarovar Project, this paper argues that state discourses and programmes essentialise scarcity as a natural phenomenon that enables the political legitimisation of large dams. In the process, they also marginalise local knowledge systems and livelihood strategies that are adapted to conditions of uncertain and limited water supply.||Lyla Mehta

The change in production norms is not confined to elite accumulation but also results in a change at all levels, marking a civilisational change from a system based on stability to one based on accumulation. The new norms, however, come at the price of loss of guaranteed access to productive resources, the decline of traditional social welfare systems and the spread of commoditisation. Such a transition, however, need not be a surrender to laissez-faire or neo-liberal policies, but can deal with negativities, including increasing masculine domination. New forms of community and continued non-market access to critical resources, like land and forests, would allow for a greater spread of the benefits.||Dev Nathan,Govind Kelkar

Yet lack of organisation and overt dependence on local traders has often led to their exploitation, with most profits of trade accruing to the latter. The onus lies on NGOs and government-designated procurement groups to help them not merely to form effective organisations to market their produce but to ensure foolproof implementation of relevant legislation.||B.

This paper discusses the work of two NGOs, working on rural development forestry in Bengal and Jharkhand, respectively. It finds that villagers, on involvement with institutions from outside, begin to expect multisectoral and integrated rural development agendas to be included in the NGOs' work plan. For an NGO to have an impact, a mere populist agenda will have to give way to readjustments that takes into consideration a more strenuous regime seeking new allies and a new legitimacy.||Manish Tiwary

The regulating authority should create conditions conducive to innovation and help in the identification of cost-effective ways of dealing with the problem.||Yamini Gupt

Demolishing a Myth||This paper, citing evidence from the ancient scriptures, attempts to establish that Hinduism - its vedic and classic variants - did not support the caste system; it rigorously opposed it in practice and principle. Even after the emergence of the caste system, Hindu society still saw considerable occupational and social mobility. Moreover, Hinduism created legends to impress on the popular mind the invalidity of the caste system - a fact further reinforced by the constant efflorescence of reform movements throughout history. The caste system survived in spite of this because of factors that ranged from the socio-economic to the ecological, which helped sustain and preserve balance among communities in a non-modern world.||M.

Its fourfold typology of forms of social solidarity is able to make explicit the different social constructions of nature, physical and human, on which environmental debate is premised. This paper applies cultural theory to the 'policy stories' around climate change and makes the case for 'clumsy' institutional arrangements that forgo elegance to accommodate the diversity of social solidarities, harnessing contestation to constructive, if noisy, argumentation.||Michael Thompson

It considers aspects such as intensity of involuntary displacement of people from their productive assets and its effects, induced urbanisation and the role of funding organisations and NGOs. It also looks at voluntary displacement, which has resulted in the depletion of large tracts of productive land.||R. N. Sharma

But there has been a staggering difference between expenditure incurred on irrigation and revenue recovered. This study examines the feasibility of differentially pricing irrigation water in normal and problematic (saline and waterlogged) soils of the command area of the Kabini project in the Cauvery basin in Karnataka.||N.

This belief is grounded in the troubled legacy of hydraulic management in the sub-continent dictated by a supply-side approach, which ignores the complexities inherent in river ecosystems.||Rohan D'Souza

Issues of food safety, particularly because of the growing trend of using sewage water in peri-urban areas for vegetable cultivation need to be examined carefully.||Sant Kumar,P. K. Joshi,Suresh Pal

Two commissions, one on tribal matters and the other on forests, are presently reviewing these subjects and this is a golden opportunity for both to meet and resolve all the land issues relating to tribals and forests and the issue of tribal access to their own forest resources which alone can bring peace and prosperity in the tribal areas.||R.
