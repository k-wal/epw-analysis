The IDBI repeal bill has been introduced in the Lok Sabha. IFCI has almost collapsed, its networth being negative. The condition of other DFIs is no better. There were structural infirmities in the model. NPAs and lack of concessional funds made DFI operations unsustainable. Finally, the policy framework designed the exit. The alternative, i e, universal banking is likely to face bigger challenges. Both the regulator and the government may have to initiate some measures to fill in the gap created by the demise of DFIs. Banks may have to be provided long-term funds facility to meet investment needs of long-gestation and infrastructure projects.||K. B. L. Mathur

However, if the growth gamble does not work, then government finances will come under severe stress and the country will have to face the consequences of a budget that did not address the very priorities that were set out by the finance minister himself in his budget speech.||Ajit Karnik

Working through anecdotes and fragments, bits and pieces of history, and the backstage life of theatre, this disjunctive discourse on the Other attempts to trouble liberal assumptions of cultural identity by calling attention to the uncertainties of evidence by which ethnic identities are politicised in diverse ways. While critiquing the exclusionary mode of 'othering' minorities, the essay also calls attention to more internalised modes of disidentification and the double-edged benefits of political identity for the underprivileged and dispossessed, whose own assertions of the self invariably complicate official identitarian constructions.||Rustom Bharucha

Part of the reason for this has been the repeated assertions of the existence of civilian control over these matters. However, over a period of time the gap between what civilian leaders know and what is actually done with nuclear weapons would become more pronounced and the views of military planners will greatly influence operational doctrines involving nuclear weapons. The acquisition of nuclear weapons by the military has several troubling implications, in particular the likelihood of the eventual adoption of a launch on warning (LOW) doctrine and the increased risk of accidental nuclear war.||M.

For in a world of fluctuating capital flows it is impossible for the authorities to predict, let alone implement, the requisite movements in the nominal exchange rate required for a managed float. If this is done, none of the fears that the authorities seem to have about absorbing capital inflows would be realistic and India could very quickly raise its growth rate, which continues to be suppressed by the misalignment of the real exchange rate.||Deepak Lal,Suman Bery,Devendra Kumar Pant

The Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF) which was introduced on June 5, 2000 is going to play a central role in RBI's liquidity management operations. The concepts of discretionary (DL) and autonomus (AL) liquidity measures make LAF a powerful instrument of monetary policy. The two-way causation between discretionary liquidity and the call money rate, which is a prime representative indicator of availability of liquidity in the system, clearly supports the use of DL and AL in the framework of the multiple indicator approach. Also worth noting in this context is the robust link between AL, DL and the monetary condition index.||R. Kannan,Indranil Sen Gupta,Siddhartha Sanyal

The article compares the term's usage within the framework of professional engineering and within the framework of British property law and village administration. Differing concepts of 'waste' point towards deep-seated conflicts in British thinking about the relationship between the state, nature and the social body of Indus basin society. While engineers saw control over a wasteful nature as the key linking technical experts to a society composed of individual producers, revenue administrators saw the existence of unproductive land, labelled as 'waste' (or commons), as key to a vision of society as composed of village communities defined not by their roles in production, but by 'blood' and genealogy. The article explores how the tensions between these conceptions of 'waste' and community shaped the long-term development of irrigation.||David Gilmartin

It is clear that countries like India will be affected by any global architecture for greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement that emerges. Despite near-term uncertainty about the size of the clean development mechanism market and the price of certified emissions reductions (CERs), it is very likely that India will be a major player. In the long run India along with other developing countries may take on some commitments especially where emissions trading may be an important component of the GHG abatement architecture.

Democracy in the business organisation and the workplace in particular has to have an organic evolution and not through a motivation plan from above. Institutions of industrial relations including the union and collective bargaining can be the best via media for bringing in new institutions that are genuinely imbued with a participative and cooperative character.

This paper draws on election outcomes, and an analysis of voter preferences at regional and national levels to seek a correlation between policy formulation and incentives provided by citizens for re-election of representatives. Such an analysis of electoral choice allows an evaluation of political opportunities available to numerically salient classes. As the data indicates, political classes no longer rely on traditional bases of support; an increasingly observable trend has been the growing obscurity of politics, polarisation, apathy and the very evident lack of demarcation among parties.||Kruti Bharucha

This paper primarily evaluates the farm-level performance of imported rice hybrids, based on representative sample farmers who grew hybrids during the 1999 boro season.

In part, internationalisation implies a redefinition of higher education as a globally marketed commodity or as an export oriented 'industry'. These developments are examined by means of an analysis of the internationalisation of Australian education, and the operational procedures, strategies, and expansionist market objectives of Australian higher education institutions in India. It is argued that, under the hegemony of neo-liberal ideology, these international linkages are emerging as a result of the transformation and restructuring of the higher education sector in both nations.||Michael Gillan,Bill Damachis,John McGuire

This and related development goals have been agreed upon by governments and the UN system, and have been labelled the Millennium Development Goals. In my recently published book, Imagine There's No Country: Poverty, Inequality and Growth in the Era of Globalisation, I had documented how the poverty reduction goal had already been reached by 2000, the very year of formulation of the goals for 2015. In a critique of my study, World Bank as well as its main poverty analyst, Martin Ravallion, question the authenticity of the data, assumptions and methods used by Imagine. In fact, data and definitions account for an insignificant amount of the difference in the poverty estimates of World Bank and Imagine. The major explanation for the higher World Bank poverty rates is found to be due to a lower growth estimate of per capita expenditures, and especially lower compared to the growth estimate obtained from national accounts data. This lower growth, 10.4 per cent over 11 years, 1987-1998, is based on household survey means (World Bank data). An associated, and surprising, finding is that while poverty estimates are accurately reproduced, there is a big divergence between the published growth rate of 10.4 per cent and the 'reproduced' survey growth of 5.6 per cent. Notwithstanding this major uncertainty about the World Bank data or its growth and poverty results, all the major findings of Imagine are faithfully reproduced exclusively using only World Bank data. Further, an extension of the World Bank poverty measurement method also yields the result that the MDG poverty reduction goal has been reached. Finally, using the recently released 1996 PPP data, poverty in 2000 was below 15 per cent for all methods, including the flawed World Bank poverty measurement method.||Surjit S. Bhalla
18/10/2003-24/10/2003||special articles||4414162||Migration of Labour: Constructing Transitional Arrangements||Past migrations took place in a relatively open world. Since the second world war continual obstructions have appeared in the free movement of people; ironically these have coincided in a period of increasing globalisation and closer interdependence between nations. Although the numbers of people moving internationally remain quite small, nations, as in the case of many in the European Union, are becoming increasingly protectionist - a policy that excludes certain immigrants in the name of defence or to safeguard 'national' identity. However, recent years have shown that the old migratory regime is crumbling. This allows an unprecedented opportunity to open the debate about the alternatives that might replace the present unsatisfactory order. Governments, as this article suggests, may set in place several transitional arrangements that while recognising free migration and the need for open borders, would also develop suitable regulation for employment of native-born workers versus the foreign-born.||Nigel Harris

Other areas, especially those pertaining to the relative powers of the review committee and the special POTA courts, too remain ill-defined. The exact relationship between the special POTA courts and the review committee now depends on the course of a show cause notice issued by the committee to the Tamil Nadu government on the question of Vaiko's arrest.||Ujjwal Kumar Singh

This paper attempts to ameliorate the sample size problem by pooling the 1999-00 NSS 55th round central and state sample data. We use the pooled data to examine regional variation in poverty within Karnataka. The poverty estimates reveal significant geographic imbalances, with much higher levels and concentration of poverty in the northern districts. Regional patterns are found to be reasonably consistent with independent correlates of poverty, including agricultural wages, employment shares, and district domestic products. However, one important inconsistency is that the rural-urban differentials in poverty rates are not credible and warrant further attention.||Rinku Murgai,M. H. Suryanarayana,Salman Zaidi

The first is the progressive universalisation of the human rights norm carried out through a large number of legal conventions and promoted, however imperfectly, through a substantial legal machinery. The second is the central and irreplaceable role of the Security Council as the core of the international law enforcement system. Except in cases of self-defence, only the Security Council can decide whether or not it is lawful to go to war. The US victory in Iraq has come at the price of re-legitimising wars of choice as an instrument of unilateral state policy and will usher in more determined efforts by many countries to acquire weapons of mass destruction, since nothing else is capable of deterring external attack.||Ramesh Thakur

The results show that an increase in the MSP of wheat and rice leads to decline in overall GDP, increase in aggregate price index and reduction in investments. Even the increase in agricultural GDP resulting from higher MSP dwindles rapidly and only a minuscule positive impact on agricultural GDP remains by the third year. More importantly, in terms of welfare the bottom 80 per cent of the rural and all of urban population are worse off.||Kirit S. Parikh,A. Ganesh-Kumar,Gangadhar Darbha

Worldwide Displacement of Democratic Judgment by Expert Assessments||The present era can be called the 'Age of Scientific Assessment'. Governments on both sides of the Atlantic, intergovernmental organisations, NGOs, and private firms have all increasingly resorted to a variety of techniques, such as probabilistic risk analysis, pollution dispersion models, urban planning models, traffic-flow models, dose-response curves, and so on, ostensibly to guide the prudent use of resources to generate social and welfare and, increasingly, the natural environment. At the same time that the span of technocratic assessment has expanded, there has been a disconcerting decline in electoral participation in many industrialised countries. This paper suggests that there is a direct link between these two phenomena. Critics suggest that the science informing such assessments should be subjected to effective democratic participation and control. Social scientists have responded to this situation by designing ingenious ways to reconcile the conflicting demands of technical competence in making scientific judgments with popular participation in assessment and decision-making processes. Such techniques individualise values and represent the challenge of democracy as that of aggregating individual preferences. The paper opens the question whether these techniques are really the solution or, perhaps, might be part of the problem. It suggests that an answer to this question requires a radical rethink of our ideas about the institutions of science, democracy, and resource management.||Steve Rayner

The ensuing crisis, mainly in the developed world, has intensified under adverse external conditions and took in its fold the rest of the world. When new investments reduced the technological superiority of steel produced in the developed world, there was a surge of investment to upscale technology and to maintain superiority. But, the thriving capital market provided conditions for similar investment in the developing countries too. At the end of the day, the world of steel gathered more plants and assets and not as much output for sale. The deepening crisis in steel brought the contending national governments on to the international arena and protection subsidies have become common. Although the steel industry has voiced strong opposition to barriers to trade, it is these barriers that the industry has sheltered behind.||A. S. Firoz

Instead attempts were made to amend the act which was later wholly repealed. The protest of the adivasis at Muthanga met with brutal repression by the government. But chastened by the public anger at the police action, the government now remains immobilised in the face of a series of fresh land occupations by adivasis in the Kerala part of the Western Ghats. If the government were to handover the land in Muthanga to the adivasis and make other lands available to landless adivasi families and bring all adivasi regions under Schedule V of Article 244 which provides for participatory self-rule and autonomy, it would herald a new era in adivasi history.||C.

The quality of his thought has sometimes been lost because of the other images Gandhi evolves - a shrewd politician and a deeply spiritual figure. Gandhi's view of moral sense, his denial of the assumed connection between moral sense and moral judgment, is of considerable philosophical interest and in his writings, take on a fascinating theoretical consolidation. In Gandhi's highly 'integrating' suggestion, as this paper suggests, there is no true non-violence until criticism is removed from the scope of moral; the ideal of non-violence is thus part of a moral position in which moral principles, which lead us to criticise others, are eschewed.||Akeel Bilgrami

A vital point which seems to have escaped the debate is that causal laws and economic processes themselves can change, as economic institutions evolve. Thus the standard econometric methodology of verifying and refuting hypotheses from observed realisations of time series data is seriously at fault. What is needed is a meta-theory, which also encompasses the effects of institutional change on economic processes. The search for such a theory is likely to prove elusive, but as economics attempts to push beyond its conventional frontiers of postulating static theories it is very likely to lose much of its formal mathematical seductiveness and take on more the appearance of a narrative-descriptive science. Many may regard this as retrogression, but at least a few will welcome it as a step taking our subject closer to the vision of its founding fathers such as Smith, Malthus, Ricardo and Keynes.||D. M.

Terrorism is a form of identitarian conflict which has a history rooted in the colonial past of many third world countries. Afghanistan is a good example illustrating the consolidation of so-called modern and traditional identities in modern history. Time and again western imperialist powers have portrayed Afghanistan as the battle frontier of western civilisation. This essay offers a deconstruction of this western mythology and points out that a holistic critique of the western appropriation of real and symbolic modernity is necessary to comprehend the problem of religious terrorism and thereby wrest the anti-American initiative from the terrorist.||Anirudh Deshpande

How can the women's movement re-engage with questions of education? Part of the challenge in thinking through concerns about gender and education lies in uncovering the dialectical linkages between the formal education system and larger social and economic processes and their influence on girls' and women's lives.||Nandini Manjrekar

Turning to Guha's peculiar smugness about 'relevance', it is argued that in talking of discourse and deployment of power within intellectual communities, the nation may not be the only legitimate category of analysis.||Krishnendu Ray

On-farm experiments have shown significant yield advantage of hybrid rice over the best-inbred rice varieties. The government launched a special hybrid rice promotion programme during 1999-2000 and has been providing subsidy on seeds as a special incentive to farmers. The private sector, including a Chinese company is also actively involved in research and seed production. But the adoption of hybrid rice is still at a low level. This paper provides some insights into the constraints to expansion of hybrid rice technology.||Cheryll B. Casiwan,Aldas Janaiah,Sergio R.

Rise in human and livestock population and development of modern agriculture have led to degradation of land and environment. If unchecked, the land resource may become increasingly less productive and may get irreversibly damaged. It is important therefore that a systematic data base is built to assess changes in land use and the type and extent of environmental damage to land resource. This paper describes the existing system for generating land use data and shows that it is not adequate to enable environmental assessment of land use. It makes a case for technological advancement and institutional changes to improve the land use data base in the country.||Sudarshan Iyengar

A similar exercise for the estimates of value added per worker derived from the results of Enterprise Surveys. The non-availability of information on value added per worker through more than one source is the reason for the paucity of such exercises.

In principle, such a mechanism could be strong, independent and effective regulatory oversight over public or private monopolies or significant competition among a large number of public and private entities. But it is important to examine without bias, and as thoroughly as possible, the feasibility and effectivness of both these sector-disciplining mechanisms before making any claims regarding the desirability of privatisation. The authors also argue that issues related to protecting the environment, extending access to the poor and other off-grid populations and strategic concerns related to import dependence and foreign private ownership need to be addressed up-front in order for the reforms to be in the broader public interest.

It underlines the prominent discourses of globalisation which in outlining the econo-techno and institutional processes as having a pervasive if uneven impact, treat them as gender neutral. The paper argues that a mode of relational analysis, which makes feminist contributions distinctive, helps to make connections and trace the naturalised assumptions in the debate on globalisation. It suggests that engendering the discourse of globalisation entails more than simply tacking women on to macrostructural models of globalisation.||Sharmila Rege

Article 23 of the TRIPS Agreement, which grants higher status only to wines and spirits and excludes other goods and products out of its purview, has generated considerable resentment. This discrimination or imbalance in protection has led to demands for additional protection to other goods and products from a number of countries including India. The Indian judiciary has played a significant role, particularly in the absence of any enforced legislation, in protecting GIs. They have entertained petitions in cases of infringement of GIs that misleads the consumer as to the place of origin or constitutes unfair competition. India has also taken legislative measures by enacting the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Act, 1999 along with the Geographical Indications of Goods (Registration and Protection) Rules, 2002 which on implementation would go a long way to protect GIs and provide a model for other countries to follow.

The widespread and often insidious influence of family law, however, has been evident even in aspects of criminal law, which constitutes the formal legal system. This 'criminalisation' of family law, the enduring presence of caste panchayats and the encroachment of religion and custom into criminal law has, this paper argues, led to a diminishing of the space and protection granted to women under the formal system. Its unfortunate consequences have also perpetuated certain ambiguities in the legal system and in some instances, even led to the denial of justice.||Vasudha Dhagamwar

This is true in case of fully as well as partly privatised firms. What is the evidence for Indian divested enterprises in this regard? This paper attempts an analysis by empirically examining the impact of divestiture. The results indicate that in case of partial divestiture, where divested equity is thinly spread with the majority shareholding still with the government, there has been no improvement in terms of profitability and operational efficiency. The paper therefore endorses the government's current policy of strategic sale, where management control passes to the strategic partner.||Sudhir Naib

This project involved the research team in a prolonged dialogue with different groups of actors in Malda and Bhojpur districts that we had identified as 'failing' districts from the point of view of effective pro-poor governance. We comment briefly on the background to this research and describe how we organised the action research process before proceeding to present the main findings of the workshops that we held in these two districts. These findings speak of the ways in which different groups of stakeholders, and members of the rural poor most especially, see the state in Bhojpur and Malda and how they would like to see certain practices of the state abolished, extended or reformed.||Stuart Corbridge,Glyn Williams,Rene Veron,Manoj Srivastava

While evidence of a holistic approach to health is observed in the writings of people like Hippocrates, the developments subsequent to the establishment of the Cartesian paradigm, contained strong elements of individualism. In fact, systematic epidemiological studies in the 19th century rightly justified epidemiology's claim as the basic 'science' of public health. But, the gradual progression away from the population perspective towards risk factor, clinical and finally molecular epidemiology, bears evidence of the increasing influence of individualism in public health.||Vijay Kumar Yadavendu

While the ancient codes contain many assertions which would be considered problematic today, lack of universality is not one of them as far as preference for truthfulness is concerned. The only occasion wherein any of the ancient codes prefer lies to truth is when someone's life is at stake. The quantitative prevalence of untruthfulness in different groups can only be empirically estimated by carefully designed questionnaires or experimentally. To minimise getting answers that the respondents will assume are expected of them, the first investigations should deal with instances of petty untruthfulness, where the consequences are trivial.||Dilip Ahuja

Sources where such alternative history exists - visual materials, accounts of women and servants - have been rendered peripheral by existing historiography because they are thought to address trivial matters.

16/8/2003-22/8/2003||special articles||4413913||Competition, Regulation and Strategy: The Information Technology Industry||The IT industry (both software and hardware) is characterised by 'vast consumer side scale and scope economies' which are incomparably larger than in other industries with supply side network economies like pipelines or electricity distribution. In IT the supply side economies are also incomparably larger because the marginal cost of an additional unit of the software or hardware especially the former is very small. But its uniqueness arises on the demand side. The interaction of these two economies, in a situation of heightened technological dynamism, imposes a greater degree of contingency, and hence path dependency in the developments in the industry as a whole. It makes possible giants like Microsoft and CISCO. Even as they extract a significant part of the scale economies in the form of large profits, such firms are competitive in the more relevant dynamic sense. In this respect these industries are therefore distinguished from nearly all other prior industries. Traditional anti-trust like regulation or price regulation is entirely outmoded for the development of these industries. Strategies with the most potential would involve promoting inter-firm linkages, promoting industries with the least need to be in contact with other firms, in fresh clusters. The costs of disassociation are too large even for large countries attempting to have a role in the evolution of IT industries, so that closed-door approaches are almost entirely unworkable.||Sebastian Morris

However, while the earlier efforts sought to contend mainly with missionary domination within the church, Chakkarai had to address the demands of majoritarian/Hindu nationalism; Christianity was viewed as 'the last act of surrender to the foreigner'. This (im)possibility of being a Christian and an Indian Hindu at the same time appears in much of Chakkarai's writings. Much though he wished his Christianity to be recovered as Indian, majoritarian nationalism recovered him as a Christian despite his nationalist credentials. Chakkarai's failure represents an instance of nationalism asserting itself by creating external Others and also producing internal Others.||M. S. S. Pandian

This paper reviews best practices in the design and implementation of safety nets. The main lessons suggest that the following are critical: having safety net instruments in place before crises occur; information on vulnerable groups to facilitate targeting; levels of spending that are adequate for this task yet consistent with sound macroeconomic policy; and administrative capacity. In this context, food-based safety nets can be an attractive option when administrative capacity is scarce, as they are conducive to self-targeting. In assessing options for minimising the adverse effects of policies on the poor and the need for social safety nets, poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) can be a useful policy tool. In general, there is scope for more systematic PSIA and more effective social safety nets to minimise the costs of crises and adjustment programmes. The evidence so far also suggests that there is room for improving the role of global food aid as an international safety net. Global food aid is well-targeted, but the size and timing of disbursements have not been appropriate for meeting shortfalls in domestic food supply in recipient countries.||Sanjeev Gupta,Benedict Clements,Gabriela Inchauste

Thus domestic factors such as agricultural growth can be neglected only at our own peril. With the information technology industry set to be a major vehicle for productivity growth, India must be prepared to withstand the increased possibility of output volatility through upswings and recessions. And as it increasingly meshes with the globalised trading and financial system, India's own financial system must be strengthened to withstand asset price shocks with policies geared to take quick remedial measures.||Vikas Chitre

Why is mathematics considered as essential to natural sciences? Why do scientists consider the applicability of mathematics as something mysterious? The applicability of mathematics is mysterious and unexplainable only if we subscribe to a particular view of mathematics, namely, mathematics as a logical, axiomatic and formal system, which deals only with a platonic world and not our real one. In contrast, there are enough reasons to believe that mathematics is a fertile lived-language, sharing many characteristics with other verbal languages. Thus, to understand the applicability of mathematics, we need to first understand the applicability of languages, for example, the 'applicability' of English. The paper discusses some common characteristics in applying English and mathematics and offers a particular model to explain why mathematics seems to be so effectively applicable in science.||Sundar Sarukkai

At the all-India level, except in respect of the number of urban poor, all the earlier results on the direction of change, namely, a clear and unambiguous decline in poverty in India in the 1990s, continue to hold good. However, the size of the decline in poverty between 1993-94 and 1999-2000, in terms of percentage change over the 1993-94 levels, is reduced by between 7 and 10 percentage points depending on the indicator and the population segment considered.

The management of strategic natural resources aided the British in the task of empire-building. Protective legislation laid down the broad parameters within which a regime of control could function efficiently and effectively. Yet control over various strategic natural resources was far from being 'direct' in the complete sense of the word; rather it was contested, often in subtle ways, and negotiated at different levels. Micro-level history of the kind this paper has sought to depict serves to highlight the intricate character of natural resource control by the colonial state.||Natasha Nongbri

Nevertheless, the acceleration is not particularly impressive for what is often hailed as the most significant policy-regime shift since 1950.

When people retire, they may choose or are sometimes required to annuitise these defined contribution savings. Therefore, it is important to learn whether or not annuities markets exist and what kinds of market failure can be anticipated. Several papers have analysed markets in the US, UK, Canada, Switzerland, Australia, Israel, Chile and Singapore. This paper extends the analysis by examining the annuities market in India. The paper focuses on the analyses of the expected present discounted value (EPDV) of cash flows from the annuity, and the money's worth ratio (MWR), which is the EPDV divided by the initial premium cost. It points to several key weaknesses in the annuities market that need to be corrected to enable the development of a healthy annuity industry in India. It also summarises some of the key policy choices that must be made to enable it to play an effective role in the broader pension reform.||Estelle James,Renuka Sane

Farmers' Experiences||The 1990s witnessed a significant deceleration in growth of rice productivity. The productivity potential of the existing modern rice varieties is getting exhausted especially under irrigated environments. This raises a serious concern about Asia's ability to sustain its food security in the 21st century. To find solutions to reverse this trend in irrigated systems, and raise yield levels in rain-fed areas, many public sector R and D institutions across Asia have invested huge public resources to explore new frontiers of rice science. However, many farmers, who grew hybrid rice initially, have started dropping out from hybrid rice cultivation. Can the currently available hybrid rice technology sustain productivity growth in the Asian tropics? Why has it not been possible to replicate in the Asian tropics China's success with hybrid rice? The paper provides a synthesis of major findings of a multi-country evaluation of farmers' experiences with the adoption of hybrid rice varieties.||Aldas Janaiah,Mahabub Hossain

It is time now that parliament, which makes laws for regulating future conduct of men and women, make rules regarding its own conduct.||Ajit Sharma

Structures of pre-colonial legitimacy were reinvented by colonialism, acquiesced to by the nationalist and the post-colonial leadership/discourses and appropriated by an identity-seeking Hindu upper caste-middle class. Together these offered a congenial climate for the development of Hindutva. This paper broadly outlines the cultural, social and political climate of Orissa at the time of the entry of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and examines how this organisation, intelligently and strategically, interacted with and adapted itself to the peculiar conditions in this 'Hindu province' during the early years of its existence in the state.||Pralay Kanungo

The 'experiment' received wide acclaim, as the methodology employed was participatory and post-training evaluation revealed higher levels of awareness and self-confidence in local participants in the programme. This paper analyses how a follow-up training project was developed soon after to create awareness on reproductive and child health issues using the medium of television. Informal channels such as television proved effective in initiating important attitudinal and behavioural changes at grass roots level, where a majority of people may have had little formal education.||T.

The time is ripe for the well-established players in the housing finance sector to introduce these products.

The main reason for this has been the high growth in unit cost. So far no attempt has been made to study whether this was the result of decline in productivity or increase in prices of inputs, or both. The present study attempts to relate unit cost with productivity for the period 1964-99. The results reveal that during 1989-99, when many A-320 aircraft were inducted in the fleet, the productivity of Indian Airlines turned negative and unit cost increased at a much higher rate. Productivity decline was the main reason for a rapid rise in unit cost. The paper suggests that Indian Airlines needs to improve its productivity, and weigh more carefully the impact of inductions of new aircraft on its overall performance.||Danish A. Hashim

Many have learned to facilitate the creation of new economies that have institutionalised incremental change with a changing political consensus, liberating themselves in part from those rigidities that make for extreme vulnerability in conditions of crisis. The same is also true of cities in Latin America and in China. However, elsewhere - including possibly India - the sovereign state is often still struggling to retain its monopoly control. In doing so, the state stifles the full potential role of cities to advance the world, to reduce the burden of world poverty. Liberating the cities is thus a key part of the agenda for the new century and for the eradication of poverty.||Nigel Harris

Made possible by cold war militarisation of the third world and the growing power of corporate transnationalism, resource frontiers grew up where entrepreneurs and armies were able to disengage nature from its previous ecologies, making the natural resources that bureaucrats and generals could offer as corporate raw material. From a distance, these new resource frontiers appeared as the 'discovery' of global supplies in forests, tundras, coastal seas, or mountain fastnesses. Up close, they replaced existing systems of human access and livelihood and ecological dynamics of replenishment with the cultural apparatus of capitalist expansion. This essay explores the making of a resource frontier in the eastern part of South Kalimantan, Indonesia, in the 1990s.||Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing

We find that an inflow of foreign capital has a significant impact on domestic money supply and stock market growth, liquidity and volatility. The banking sector, however, remains relatively insulated due to policy responses of the central bank and barriers to direct capital inflows into the banking system. The paper concludes with a discussion on the costs of these policies in the event of a heavy inflow of foreign capital into India.||Renu Kohli

The model builds on past research suggesting that the key determinants of the rate of poverty reduction at state level are agricultural yields, growth of the non-farm sector (depending on the state's initial conditions), development spending, and inflation. The model is used to predict the rates of poverty reduction over the period 1994-2000. The overall incidence of poverty is projected to have fallen from 39 per cent to 34 per cent over this period, suggesting that the rate of poverty reduction in the 1990s is slightly lower than the 1980s, and lower than one would have expected given the growth in the 1990s. We offer some explanations as to why the growth process in the 1990s has not done more to reduce poverty in India.||Gaurav Datt,Valerie Kozel,Martin Ravallion

Earlier state-level (rural vs urban) analyses are extended to present these data at the district level in the form of maps. Multivariate statistical analyses exploring social and economic covariates that affect the likelihood of gender bias in death (female disadvantage in child mortality risk) have been conducted. The female disadvantage is evident in birth and death spread over India in the decade 1981-1991. Though infant and child mortality levels fell for girls and boys, gender differences persisted, and penetrated the hitherto egalitarian south. Masculine SRB that were seen only in urban areas of the north-west in 1981 have spread to urban areas of many northern states in 1991. Multivariate analyses suggest that between 1981-1991, women's status variables become less associated with reduced gender bias. Modernisation variables suggest less association with gender bias, or that a substitution of pre-natal for post-natal elimination of unwanted daughters may be occurring. These findings are situated in the literature on gender, education, paid work participation, and marriage system changes in India.||S. Sudha,S. Irudaya Rajan

The links between top army personnel, bureaucrats and political leaders, on the one hand, and terrorists and drug barons, on the other, have acquired a measure of legitimacy under the banner of Islam and jihad. The transnational links of terrorist outfits also necessitate international coalitions to weed out terrorism. Nevertheless the India-Pakistan peace initiatives that are currently under way represent a positive development because they can make an incremental contribution to ending cross-border terrorism.||Rajen Harshe

The campaign had its beginnings in the controversy that followed the sentencing to life of Vijia Lakshmi, a young Hindu widow for the crime of infanticide in 1881. The case drew attention to the plight of young widows who were victims of infant marriages and enforced widowhood, as caste rules forbade widow remarriage.

In this paper, we work out the cost of certain guarantee structures in the context of a simplified model.

While the 1992 break in trade, transport, storage, and communication is encouraging, it is still too early to measure the full effects of the more recent reforms in the 1990s.||Jessica Seddon Wallack

Instead, it ought to be viewed as a case of 'dalit assertion' for equal rights and a share in the resources that belong commonly to the village and had so far been in the exclusive control of the locally dominant caste, the jats. Further, notwithstanding the rather peculiar and complex nature of the Talhan case, this could mark the beginning of a new phase in the history of caste relations in Punjab. Though the issues are varied, there seems to be an underlying pattern in several other cases of conflict being currently reported in the state.||Surinder S. Jodhka,Prakash Louis

Once that happens, the states doing poorly would continue to fall behind, no 'pork barrels' to help them out; the members they would elect to the Rajya Sabha would belong to the species of carpet-baggers, without any sense of loyalty to the electing states, and no prick of conscience to bother them either.||A.

On the one hand the government's perceptions about the Naga struggle have undergone a sea-change and it has shown a large degree of flexibility in trying to work out a political settlement; on the other hand those who have been fighting for an independent Nagalim have also become aware of the inherent complexities involved in their struggle and the impossibility of a military solution. The two principal issues that need to be resolved through negotiations are (a) the question of Naga sovereignty/self-determination and (b) the question of a unified Nagalim/Greater Nagalim. The NSCN(I-M) has given no indication of any rethinking on the question of a Greater Nagalim. On the other issue, however, though the official position of the NSCN(I-M) still is that it is committed to a sovereign, independent Nagalim, it is clear that greater autonomy and not sovereignty would be the issue that would have to be hammered out in the coming talks.||Udayon Misra

But it failed to make a dent on caste hierarchy. The moral to be drawn is that an ideological attack on caste which is not backed up or underpinned by a mode of social production ignoring or violating caste-based division of labour is totally inadequate. A combination of wholly new technologies, institutions based on new principles and a new ideology which includes democracy, equality and the idea of human dignity and self-respect has to be in operation for a considerable time to uproot the caste system. Such a combination of forces is today bringing about the destruction of the caste-based system of production in the villages and at the local level.||M. N. Srinivas

It will raise a number of queries about colonial criminology - Who were the criminals in 19th century Calcutta? How were they made? What was the nature of their crimes? To what extent did they bring forth the colonial penal system, and in what measure did this newly organised system of detection, prosecution and punishment, in its turn, create new types of crime?

This paper undertakes a detailed analysis of various aspects of this situation. It first reviews a series of recent judgments of the Supreme Court that have set aside orders of the MRTP Commission, depriving it of extra-territorial jurisdiction and the power to restrict imports, and curbing its tendency to adjudicate 'fair' prices. Section II examines the Competition Act, especially several amendments that were introduced as it was being passed, including one that explicitly arms the Competition Commission with the authority to impose import restrictions, and several others that will be self-defeating or difficult to implement. While these two sections employ standard economic theory and comparisons with contemporary international practice, Section III adopts a more historical approach, examining the political economy of competition policy in various countries, and its limited scope for serving distributional objectives in the Indian context. Section IV argues that the case for a WTO agreement on competition policy is greatly overstated, and that India should ally with other developing countries to block such an agreement. On a more positive note, while amendments to the Competition Act are implied by the analysis of Section II, the two succeeding sections develop criteria for exemptions from its provisions.||Aditya Bhattacharjea

Whether the Constitution was intended to be adequately equipped to control privatisation in education or to promote is a moot question. However, the judicial decoding of the Constitution's intent in this regard has seemingly changed direction in the last two decades. The view that private control promises quality, that appears to have the apex court's concurrence, is helping to sustain an ethos of sharpening social divisions and inequalities, where private interests can boldly advance and the state withdraws.||Krishna Kumar

Viewed from a wider perspective of neoliberal capitalist expansion, the creation of a global proletariat is facilitated by the dismantling of customary relations to land, forest and water. The fact that many dams throughout the world are located in territories in which existing populations hold legally tenuous relations to the environment may not be a coincidence. Further, existing laws and planning policies related to dam developments share a worldview that meshes utilitarian logic and legal belief in private property with an abstract concept of space and the environment.||Judy Whitehead

The growth centres provide basic industrial infrastructure like power, water, telecom and banking to enable the states to attract industries. This paper attempts to assess qualitatively the performance of the growth centres on the basis of primary data collected from field visits to several centres, discussion with state governments and visits to several firms located in the growth centres. It is found that without the infrastructure provided by the growth centre, many firms (even some representing local entrepreneurship) would not have located where they are. The firms have a favourable impact on the local labour markets. A few of the firms export and some contribute socially to the local communities.

Most opponents of the Washington Consensus appear to have used the term in recent years to mean universal application of the neoliberal interpretation of the term. Perhaps this usage was to some extent legitimised by the fact that at least for a period in the 1990s some of the Washington institutions - the IMF and key agencies of the US government like the Treasury - did indeed urge parts of this extended agenda, most damagingly a pace of capital account liberalisation that most people agree in retrospect to have been precipitate. But even if the Washington Consensus is absolved of responsibility for provoking crises, it is true that outcomes in Latin America have disappointed in the last decade, including in many countries that have stabilised, liberalised, and opened up. This suggested that the time was ripe for taking another look at the policy agenda of the region. The results of this effort are being published in After the Washington Consensus: Restarting Growth and Reform in Latin America [Kuczynski and Williamson 2003]. The focus is on Latin America, but the history of the Washington Consensus suggests that one needs to ask if the thoughts could be of wider relevance. Obviously they will need amending to suit the circumstances of a particular country. The author has classified the new reform agenda into four big themes: crisis-proofing; completing (and, where necessary, correcting) the 'first-generation' liberalising reforms that constituted the core of the Washington Consensus; complementing them with 'second-generation' (institutional) reforms; and broadening the reform agenda to include a concern with income distribution. This paper is devoted to sketching these four themes.||John Williamson

In the days of controls, every businessman was looked upon as a criminal. Today all that opprobrium is gone. This is where the greatest promise lies, as well as the greatest peril. Although the status of the businessman has changed, his mentality has not; he is still the petty deal-cutter. This will change only when businessmen combine in their dealings with the government. And it is not only a good administration we need. We also need a social conscience.||Ashok V. Desai

The strong correlation between the prices of the dually listed stocks is corroborated by the finding of a bidirectional causality in a vector auto regression model. The competing domestic stock exchange, viz, National Stock Exchange (NSE) too is found to share the same bidirectional relation scripwise with the Nasdaq/New York Stock Exchange. Furthermore, the impulse responses pattern indicates that a positive shock in the domestic (international) price of a scrip gets transmitted in terms of a strong positive movement in the international (domestic) price the very next day. Thus, the quotes of both the markets share not only a stockwise bidirectional causality, but markets also are efficient in processing and incorporating the pricing information.||Sanjay K.

This relationship did not change materially after the European enclaves of Madras and Pondicherry were established. It was, however, redefined, since the indigenous merchants in these early colonial port cities were, at least formally, subservient to the authority of the Europeans. At the same time, the growing importance of the local merchants in these commercial centres created an opening and a space for them in indigenous society through which they could create a new identity for themselves as the new social elite and patrons of local institutions, arts and culture.||Kanakalatha Mukund

The development of Karur as an industrial district demonstrates how the spontaneous reproposal of processes that are well known in the European sphere, but which reflect systemic traditions strongly connected with a production system that is 'anchored' to quite definite localisms, highlights the existence of multiple modernities. One effect of this process is a general 'diffusion of possibilities' in the local social tissue for those who are able and know how to exploit them. The small units also manage to provide concrete answers to the problem of unemployment among the most disadvantaged social classes. Manifestations of the 'high road', that is the competition between the units based on the constant attempt to bring improvements to the products is evident; but so is the 'low road' with high social costs: Precarious working conditions, exploitation of the workers, low cost labour, few innovations, relatively low quality of the products, environmental pollution.||Marco Corsi

Contemporary madrasas continue to use the colonial dichotomy of public and private spheres to resist state intrusions in their pursuit of a particular kind of religious education. Introducing modern education in madrasas would defeat their very purpose.||Arshad Alam

Indeed, the slowing down of agricultural growth in the post-reform period, despite the favourable macroeconomic environment, is explained by the neglect of reforms directly affecting agriculture. This essay seeks to spell out a reform agenda for agriculture within the framework of a two-pronged strategy: (a) to release the initiative and enterprise of farmers and the private sector in general by removing restrictions on agricultural trade, processing, etc; and (b) to facilitate adequate supply response to the incentives so created by strengthening infrastructure, agricultural research and extension and delivery of credit, while protecting the environment.||C.

Yet feminist politics is constantly confronted with a scepticism against institutionalised politics; it displays an uneasiness with the forms of power that dominate political processes. Similarly the politics of mainstreaming women's studies implies that feminist scholarship has had to cope with the complex web of relationships within academia dominated by a patriarchal academy and knowledge hierarchy. But as this paper explains, while institutional locations may also form their own sites of contest, the need for a renewed and sustained struggle from such locations, employing new interventions in the hope of transforming institutions, remains of crucial importance for the women's movement.||Kumud Sharma

These reforms improved the openness of the Indian economy vis-à-vis other emerging economies. Much, however, remains to be done. India's economy is still relatively closed compared to its 'peer competitors'. Further reduction of tariff protection and liberalisation of capital flows will enhance the efficiency of the economy and along with reform of domestic policies will stimulate investment and growth. The main lesson of the nineties is that liberalisation of the current and capital account increases the flexibility and resilience of the BOP. This applies to trade, invisibles, equity capital, MLT debt flows, and the exchange market. The author's analysis confirms that in India the exchange rate is a powerful instrument of adjustment in the current account deficit. It also confirms that equity outflows are very unlikely to be a major cause of BOP problems (unlike short-term debt). The impact of fiscal profligacy on the external account has become indirect and circuitous with the implementation of external sector reforms. It operates much more through the general expectations about economic (growth) prospects and the risk premium demanded by foreign (and domestic) investors and lenders. Thus its negative effects are likely to be focused on the domestic rather than the external account. In other words, the negative long-term effects of fiscal profligacy are more likely to be felt in future on the growth rate of the economy and the health of the domestic financial sector.||Arvind Virmani

However, as a recent seminar on relocation revealed, there has been of late a significant improvement in approaches adopted towards relocation as increasing numbers of forest managers seek to sensitively consider aspects of equity and justice. But while a comprehensive approach linking PA management with people's livelihoods on a regional scale is needed, such approaches also need to be locale-specific rather than a blueprint solution to meet all needs.||Ghazala Shahabuddin,Amita Shah

We show that the takeover guidelines could cause a transfer of wealth from the majority shareholders to the minority shareholders. As a result, lower proceeds (than otherwise) are raised in disinvestments involving strategic sale of PSUs with a public float. The magnitude of this problem is discussed by analysing TCS's acquisition of CMC in 2001. Further, we also present a framework that can be used to mitigate the wealth transfer. In the TCS acquisition of CMC, we show that a simple implementation of the framework could have raised the proceeds by as much as 6 per cent, and possibly more.||V. Ravi Anshuman

It is contended that strategic sale, by transferring control from government to a private owner, is best suited to the objective of improved efficiency. Because a process of bidding subject to a reserve price is involved, it will also help meet the objective of maximising government revenues through privatisation. This paper reviews these claims drawing on the findings of auction theory and the empirical evidence on methods of sale in privatisation worldwide. It also addresses popular misconceptions about the benefits of strategic sale. The auction literature suggests that strategic sale using the first-priced sealed-bid method currently employed cannot always be counted upon to maximise efficiency and revenues. The empirical evidence shows that share issue privatisation, the sale of government shares through a public offer, has been the preferred method of sale in privatisation carried out elsewhere.||T. T.

This paper looks at community radio in Australia and South Africa. Australia has a mature 'third tier' of broadcasting, now over 20 years old, facing the problems of an established sector, with consistent if relatively diminishing state support. As a relatively new democracy, South Africa's adoption of community radio is significant on a global scale. As the debate around community radio in India gathers momentum, and various initiatives start to emerge, some of the challenges they currently face may have lessons for India.||Jo Tacchi

15/3/2003-21/3/2003||perspectives||4413338||Freedom of Religion||The time is now opportune to argue forcefully that the best guardian of freedom of religion, and the most effective guarantor that unfair conversions, particularly on a collective basis, shall not take place, will be not the state but civil society, or, better still, the two in association. This is at the moment only an idea: it will need serious effort to work it out, particularly if communal dissensions are acute as they are now. Also to be kept in mind is the issue of the role of the secular state in other contexts. Secularism, understood as the attitude of mutual toleration among the religious communities comprising the nation, and of neutrality or non-discrimination on the part of the state in its dealings with the citizens, irrespective of their religious identity, apparently protects freedom of religion. Two problems must be addressed, however. First, is the secular state neutral through engagement, that is by being respectful towards all religions, or through disengagement, that is by erecting a wall, as it were, between itself and the religious life of the citizens? Secondly, what is involved in a community's conception of the profession and practice of its religion?||T. N. Madan

The right to food is a right to policies (or, is a right to a right) that enable individuals to produce or acquire minimum food entitlements. From this perspective, it is evolving into an enforceable right. Its potential for channelling food aid from donors more effectively, enabling governments to do what they should, and sharpening the focus of NGOs in a strategy to eliminate hunger, malnutrition and famines is likely to be substantial. While the realisation of this right is slow and difficult, it would be a mistake to discard it on the ground that too many rights make it harder to enforce them.||Raghav Gaiha

A proper review of the project must assess both its technical feasibility and whether the costs of increasing effective supply (including environmental and rehabilitation costs) by augmentation through interlinking is commensurate with the benefits by way of increased production. It must also be examined whether there is scope for improving efficiency of use beyond what is assumed, what the costs and benefits would be and how they will compare with those of interlinking.||A.

This description of the substantive content of the law indicates that the restrictions on the termination of errant workers are embedded in judicial concerns of equality. Translated into procedure this requires, one, that penalties imposed on workers be proportional to misconduct, and two, that stringent evidentiary requirements be met in every case of worker termination. These constraints lead to a trade-off between concerns of efficiency and justice, opening up the question of whether such a trade-off is inevitable or it is possible to ease the trade-off by structurally reorienting the law.||Jaivir Singh

Although Kerala's socio-economic context and political culture have placed it in a unique position to realise the goal of democratic decentralisation, and the campaign itself is a remarkable example of the state's capacity for intelligent public mobilisation, it was found that the plan implementation faced some major hurdles. On the basis of a case study conducted in Palakkad district, the author also looks at the actual follow-up events and the impact of political affiliations, staffing issues, and lack of technical expertise on the course of project implementation. The paper argues that the discourse on decentralisation in Kerala also has relevance for the whole country, as the People's Campaign has offered a new paradigm for participatory planning. The issues it has thrown up can help to focus attention on what needs to be done to make decentralisation a meaningful exercise in other states.||Rashmi Sharma

The national supervisors continue to look upon the Basel Committee to set standards which will be universally relevant and take into account the differences in the stages of development of the banking systems and supervisory capabilities in the developing world.

The emphatic push towards a positive image of the moneylender which has become very visible internationally has not been so visible in Indian rural finance practice. This article points out that the positive image of the moneylender has survived all through the centuries of Muslim and British domination in India and the push from negative to positive paradigm in development thought needs only to resuscitate a latent image which has been lying under the dominant negative one. A historical awareness of the process of paradigm-building is essential in unravelling this development enigma and in understanding its underlying ideological investments. The question of the moneylender's socio-economic image is very important in shaping rural finance policies.||Shishir Sharma,S. Chamala

While the Sikhs today constitute a big, easily recognisable community in Canada, indispensable as a vital economic force in the country, they have also tried to construct an 'identity' of their own. The articulation of identity in the case of immigrant Sikhs, however, may not simply be understood in terms of immigrants/host society dichotomy and its dynamics; the internal dynamics of the Sikh community in Canada too need to be considered. This paper also examines the various controversies that arose from the 1970s onwards, which helped define Sikh perceptions about themselves as citizens of modern, multicultural Canada.||Paramjit S.

Each swing of the pendulum originates in the dysfunction of whatever organisational thrust happened to be dominant at the beginning of the swing.

The paper proceeds then to estimate poverty in India in 1999-2000 according to different methods, emphasising in particular a method which uses information about increases in NSS household survey-measured real wages between 1983 and 1999. The paper concludes that, in particular in the light of data from the national sample surveys, it is almost incontrovertible that poverty in India was less than 15 per cent in 1999-2000 - which is some conceptual distance away from the corresponding 35 to 40 per cent World Bank estimate for the same year and is nearly half the official government of India estimate of 26 per cent.||Surjit S.

Such a structure can lead to a better understanding of the poverty scenario in each state.

Trade union leaders from the tea industry have unequivocally condemned the incident. But they have also drawn attention to the fact that tea garden managements in Assam have been systematically ignoring the demands of the workers, especially for welfare measures. Successive governments in Assam have failed to force managements to implement the Plantations Labour Act of 1951. Managements now claim that the industry is passing through a recession, but during the tea boom of the 1990s the same managements did not share even a minuscule part of their prosperity with the workers.||Udayon Misra

Four main issues are examined. The paper first looks at a few of the theories that have been advanced to explain the stylised facts of economic fluctuations and then examines the main features of business cycles in the Indian economy over the past 50 years. In the process, it presents forecasts of aggregate economic activity for 2002-03 and 2003-04 besides obtaining quantitative estimates of the impact of the business cycle on the fiscal deficit. Second, it empirically measures the threshold rate of inflation within the framework of growth-inflation trade-offs and derives the optimal rate of monetary expansion needed to smooth out fluctuations and stabilise the inflation rate at its threshold level. Third, it specifies a theoretical model (linking growth, inflation, interest rates and money supply) capable of deriving an optimal fiscal deficit which maximises the real growth rate; and applies it within the Indian context to measure the desired amount of fiscal consolidation. Finally, it provides estimates of a comprehensive macroeconomic conditions index which can very effectively be incorporated into a simple Taylor-type interest rate rule (reaction function) for monetary policy.||M.

A saving grace is the strong commitment to reform of procedures but at present this is only a statement of intent. The economic reforms announced are modest though welcome. In substantive terms there is nothing remarkable about the budget's expenditure priorities. As for expenditure containment and control, the budget provides an antithesis by its unprecedented indulgence in underfunded initiatives. And this is likely to make the unusually large projected fiscal and revenue deficits substantially greater as the year runs its course. This too brings back memories of the 1980s.||Shankar Acharya

One of these takes the deduction of 'certain' conclusions from clearly stated axioms or models as the primary objective; the other considers number the primary concept, and emphasises computation and algebra, conforming to unambiguous rules. A philosophy that may be called computational positivism, whose goal is to make computation agree with observation, appears to have been characteristic of Indian (and apparently Babylonian) astronomy. The interactions between these two cultures have played a key role in the history of science, and seem set to continue to do so in the future as well.||Roddam Narasimha

From a largely limited activist base from the emergency period of the 1970s, it has since moved into newer areas, with newer sources of support especially among more marginalised sections. But the movement, unlike its counterpart in the west, remains constantly challenged by prevailing complexities of the political process. The emergence of newer identities and shifting quality of these identities shaped by the very nature of politics and electoral processes in India coupled with the paucity of similar experiences in western liberal democracies, ensures that civil and democratic rights movement has to often formulate its own responses, make its own theoretical and conceptual innovations to meet such challenges.||Aswini K.

Despite recent signs of progress, UP still faces significant challenges in reducing poverty in its various economic and non-economic dimensions and improving security and well-being for all citizens. The poor are a heterogeneous group: they are deprived not only in material terms, but also have low human development, and live in an uncertain and sometimes threatening environment. Lower caste individuals and women face particular difficulties. Poverty is caused by low levels of assets (private, public goods and services, and social capital) coupled with low and uncertain returns. The state faces three major challenges in redressing poverty - first, to expand economic opportunities, second to ensure that the poor are empowered to take advantage of new opportunities in a rapidly changing world, and third to ensure an effective safety net is in place to reduce vulnerability and protect the very poor and destitute.||Valerie Kozel,Barbara Parker

The analysis is based on the comparable estimates of poverty for the mixed reference period computed from the unit record data for the 50th (1993-94) and the 55th (1999-2000) rounds of the Consumer Expenditure Surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation. The issue is how far different social and economic groups shared the overall decline in poverty in the 1990s. The social groups most vulnerable to poverty have been identified to be scheduled caste and scheduled tribe households with both these groups having above average levels of poverty indicators in the rural and the urban population. Among the economic groups, the most vulnerable groups are the agricultural labour households (rural) and the casual labour households (urban) each having the highest levels of poverty indicators in their respective population segments. In terms of changes in poverty in the 1990s, it is found that while scheduled caste, agricultural labour (rural) and casual labour (urban) households experienced declines in poverty on par with the total population, scheduled tribe households fared badly in both the segments.||K.

Decomposing the change in the central government's liabilities relative to GDP since 1951-52, it is seen that but for three recent years, the accretion to debt relative to GDP was due to the cumulated primary deficits. A significant part of the effect of the cumulated primary deficits could be absorbed in the sixties, seventies, and the nineties due to the excess of growth over interest rate. However, there were large unabsorbed parts in the fifties and the eighties. The cushion provided by the excess of growth over interest rate may not continue to be available for long. For three years, viz, 2000-01 to 2002-03, the interest rate exceeded the growth rate. This, together with the continuing primary deficits though at a reduced level, led to acceleration in the increase in the debt-GDP ratio in recent years. For stabilisation of the debt-GDP ratio at current or reduced levels, focus on primary balance becomes necessary.||C. Rangarajan,D. K. Srivastava

Beginning from early debates on nationalism and the nation state, the word 'nation' has shifted, coming to acquire at one and the same time, an expanding meaning and an ambivalence. Literature and the different social sciences, on the other hand, have exposed the nature of evil, depicting the nation as a genre of violence. A study of European and African works shows how the creation of nation has been fraught with a marginalisation of other groups and voices, with pain and suffering. Literature and language, this article suggests, must once again become tools to plumb the banality of evil that is inherent in the nation state.

GSDP at market prices and a comprehensive concept of debt consistent with the fiscal deficit of a state government are the right concepts to use for the purpose. Neither the rating agencies nor the finance commissions have used the right concepts so far. Illustrative estimates for Gujarat show that this can lead to misleading target setting and wrong perceptions about the fiscal performance of the states.||Ravindra H. Dholakia

Within this framework it is possible to capture both gradual and abrupt transitions in social systems. In the context of social dynamics, the relevance of self-organising behaviour and complexity theory are highlighted. Social systems are essentially complex structures capable of self-organisation, exhibiting a rich variety of features like bifurcation, hysteresis and multiple equilibria. Conventional linear approach is too simplistic a framework to capture and deal with such phenomena. A number of specific models are discussed. These describe the qualitative changes in a variety of social systems they simulate and also explain the forces that govern their evolutionary behaviour.||Karmeshu,V. P. Jain

But before we introduce exchange traded interest rates futures it is necessary to be fully aware of the ground realities. The basic issue is the healthy development of the market and abolition of the regulations that artificially protect the interests of a set of intermediaries whose role and functions have got significantly reduced with massive induction of IT applications into the capital and financial markets. Regulatory reforms should facilitate continuous reduction in transaction costs and upgradation of transactional efficiency across different segments of the market. A regulatory regime that ends up protecting the role of certain players merely because they played a useful role in the past in the development of some segments of the markets would be doing a disservice.||R.

The programmes for homemakers in the US emerging out of the newly created field of home science imparted a class-specific, racialised, and sexualised vision of gender relations with the purpose of transforming farming families into capitalist units of production and consumption. Through the politics of nation-building and transnational development aid, this model of agriculture development was exported to India under the auspices of a 'modern' and 'scientific' programme of agriculture development. Yet these programmes were not imported without change, for many Indians were committed to creating a modern India which was decidedly not western. Thus the translation of the US-based programmes for home science became one of many sites of hybridisation through which an Indian modernity was imagined and produced.||Kim Berry

Interpretations of the self, mind and world based on such vision influence socio-cultural norms and relations. It also leads to theorisation, which when formulated into principles of action to understand the world become ideologies. All educational systems carry the germ of some ideology. This paper suggests that there are two broad epistemological premises that determine the structure of knowledge, meaning and truth. One that believes that reality is material and governed by laws that the human mind can understand; the other premise asserts the inherent creative principle of the human mind and that knowledge itself is in part constructed of sensory data and perception. Since it is never completely possible to move behind an epistemic frame, reform initiatives, especially in education, should question whether processes of reform will really ensure transformation of relationships on more equal terms or will they reinforce dependency and hierarchy.||Amita Sharma

And when the results of the quinquennial survey for 1999-2000 were released, the change in its survey design threw up yet another controversy about the validity of its results. These two issues have been discussed at length and we shall outline briefly the salient aspects of the discussion and move on to the more substantive question whether conditions of rapid growth and decline in poverty obtained in the 1990s.||R.

By focusing on the case of 'water-scarce' Kutch and its relationship with the controversial Sardar Sarovar Project, this paper argues that state discourses and programmes essentialise scarcity as a natural phenomenon that enables the political legitimisation of large dams. In the process, they also marginalise local knowledge systems and livelihood strategies that are adapted to conditions of uncertain and limited water supply.||Lyla Mehta

Since expenditure of vast sums of taxpayers' money annually will thus be riding on the APL-BPL categorisation of households, it is imperative that the methodology proposed by the Expert Group underpinning the 2002 BPL Census is widely discussed and debated.||K.

Moreover, there is a wide gap in learning achievements between government schools and private/aided schools. The active participation of children in primary education hinges on a plethora of factors. Besides access, a range of demand and supply issues influence why children choose to attend school regularly. Thus far, policy-makers and education administrators have focused mainly on the formal school system and on improving access to education. The creation of 'backward and forward' linkages is essential to creating an environment where every child not only goes to school but benefits from it.||Vimala Ramachandran

To meet the challenge the US Federal Reserve Board has adopted a policy of reducing interest rate to almost zero. This note argues that the Fed policy of almost-zero interest rate tilts the factor-price ratio severely against labour vis-à-vis capital. In a regime of zero interest rate the economy would minimise the use of labour, replacing it by capital as far as possible. The professed goal of attaining the 'potential output' that means full employment, inter alia, will be defeated by the very policy that seeks to close the 'output gap'. This note constructs an alternative or additional policy to combat deflation. It also alerts third world countries that America and Europe may resort to competitive devaluation in order to export their deflation to third countries.||Ranjit Sau

The change in production norms is not confined to elite accumulation but also results in a change at all levels, marking a civilisational change from a system based on stability to one based on accumulation. The new norms, however, come at the price of loss of guaranteed access to productive resources, the decline of traditional social welfare systems and the spread of commoditisation. Such a transition, however, need not be a surrender to laissez-faire or neo-liberal policies, but can deal with negativities, including increasing masculine domination. New forms of community and continued non-market access to critical resources, like land and forests, would allow for a greater spread of the benefits.||Dev Nathan,Govind Kelkar

The convergence of computer, telecommunications and infrastructure for broadcasting is making information storage, distribution and use universally available and affordable. Against this background, the continuance of administratively separated service licences is anachronistic. However, the initial move of the TRAI to migrate only the basic, limited mobility and full mobility licences into the unified licence was not properly conceived. Fortunately, the TRAI has amended its consultation document to include NLD, ILD and Internet also. In the light of our own experience and more so that of other countries, we should now move all information services into a permissive unified licence with the simplest of conditions and lightest financial burdens.||T.

Simultaneously, however, a large number of previously non-poor households had also fallen into poverty, resulting in a rather small net improvement in the poverty situation in this area. Since the reasons for people overcoming poverty are quite distinct from the reasons why they succumb to it, different policy instruments are required to promote escape from poverty and to prevent decline into it, in this region and in other parts of the country.||Anirudh Krishna

It suggests that this decline is not just a seasonal fluctuation but an indication of fish famine in terms of both production and accessibility.||Ramachandra Bhatta,K. Aruna Rao,Suguna K. Nayak

The approach adopted and the concrete measures proposed are more short-term palliatives rather than fresh ideas for deploying these vast investible resources productively. Unlike countries in south-east Asia, concerted efforts are required in India to channel these capital inflows to supplementing domestic saving and strengthening physical infrastructures through well-calibrated delivery of project finance and other institutional credit.

Alongside a widespread intellectual ferment, the period also saw for the first time, the emergence of economics as a science in western India. In their interpretation and writings on economic issues, Indian intellectuals and thinkers had also to confront the dilemma of understanding the British Indian empire. This paper looks at the writings of prominent 19th century thinkers of western India of the period and asks in what ways the constraints of working within a colonial dominance and their responses to it, in turn influenced the economic knowledge that was produced.||Neeraj Hatekar

While alarming pressures on their sexuality and fertility have just begun to be noticed, concerns about their social condition, their universe are just beginning to be unveiled.

Hybrid rice technology was projected as the harbinger of another rice revolution in the state, as the yield potential of existing varieties was declining. However, the initial experiences of farmers who grew hybrid rice in the state indicated that it was not profitable relative to existing modern varieties. Recently, scientists have claimed that the initial experiences of hybrid rice cultivators are no longer relevant as many new rice hybrids of better quality were developed and marketed by the late 1990s. The current study tests, the widely propagated hypothesis that these new rice hybrids have been accepted by farmers in Andhra Pradesh.||Aldas Janaiah

Deficiencies in facilitating the potential of panchayati raj persist at three levels - state, panchayati raj institutions and societal levels. Big government at the state level with a patrimonial perception of self and aggrandiser instincts has pushed the 'self-governance participatory model' of the panchayats to the periphery, both at the level of discourse and praxis. This coupled with conceptual inadequacies, epistemic and operational constraints, poor finances, and political interference have posed a serious challenge to the realisation of the potential role envisaged for panchayats in the 73rd Amendment. If panchayati raj has to fulfil its foundational tenets of empowering the community there is need to recognise the primacy of societal good over individual or political goals. PRIs have to transform themselves into community institutions fulfilling a social contract with an all inclusive participatory planning and associationalism as essential methodologies.||Aureliano Fernandes

These focus on possible interference between alternative reference periods used to elicit expenditure data from sampled households. This paper resolves these concerns, using comparable consumer expenditure data from the employment-unemployment survey (EUS) of the 55th round, as well as data from four experimental rounds of the CES, conducted between the quinquennial larger scale 50th and 55th rounds. It shows that the size distributions of consumer expenditure from the 55th round CES are comparable to ones from the 50th round - subject to appropriate recalculation - and that there is accordingly unambiguous evidence that poverty in India declined in the 1990s, in all dimensions. Indeed, the average annual rate of reduction in the last six years of the 1990s is shown to have been higher than that between 1982 and 1993.||K. Sundaram,Suresh D. Tendulkar

This has significant implications for the reproductive health of women in India. The present configuration of national family planning services is not likely to bring about widespread condom use, which would protect women from HIV. Limited access by women, especially the poor, to health care in general means that women who are HIV positive are at an additional disadvantage. Absence of accessible voluntary counselling and testing (VCT) services will impair the effectiveness of HIV control programme in India. HIV positive women in India face serious problems with respect to marriage, sexuality, and childbearing and as the epidemic spreads these will impact on the wider society. Research studies are required in the field of mother to child transmission (MTCT) of HIV, particularly through breastfeeding, in the Indian context. While social initiatives such as the empowerment of women are required to provide reproductive health security to women, a comprehensive confidential voluntary counselling and testing programme is urgently needed.||Saseendran Pallikadavath,R.

An attempt is made here to explore the relationship between irrigation development and wage rate of agricultural labourers using statewise cross section data pertaining to five points of time: 1972-73, 1977-78, 1983, 1987-88 and 1993-94. The results of the study show that there is a positive impact of availability of irrigation on real wages of agricultural labourers. Also irrigation helps to narrow down the difference between the statutory minimum wages and prevailing wage rates. The gender wage differential is found to be narrowing at a faster rate in the states where irrigation is higher.||A. Narayanamoorthy,R. S. Deshpande

The embargo created an informal market for these goods. More importantly it allowed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam to play a dominant role in the management of the economy in the territory, leading to a dual economic system, a command economy in the north and east and a private sector-led liberal market economic model in the rest of the country. It is now a year since the economic embargo has been lifted. How has it affected the economy of N and E province? What are the factors inhibiting economic revival in this region?||Muttukrishna Sarvananthan

Drawing on a joint CSO-NSSO exercise at cross-validation of NAS and NSS, this paper details weaknesses of both types of estimates, but shows that NAS cannot be accepted as a more reliable yardstick for either aggregate consumption expenditure or that on specific commodity groups. This is due to the inherent 'fluidity' of NAS estimates, weaknesses in their underlying database, and the fragility of the rates, ratios and norms used in the commodity-flow balance underpinning the PFCE. Despite its shortcomings, it is argued that NSS is preferable because it is based on direct observations relating to the survey period and because, unlike NAS, it avoids recourse to adjustments based on arbitrary assumptions.||K.

Even after the emergence of the caste system, Hindu society still saw considerable occupational and social mobility. Moreover, Hinduism created legends to impress on the popular mind the invalidity of the caste system - a fact further reinforced by the constant efflorescence of reform movements throughout history. The caste system survived in spite of this because of factors that ranged from the socio-economic to the ecological, which helped sustain and preserve balance among communities in a non-modern world.||M.

This paper undertakes a critical examination of this assignment, its magnitude and quality, by questioning its analytical underpinnings. The paper examines the search for the appropriate international financial architecture as the virtuous approach to the assignment and concludes that the identification of international standards and codes for adoption by countries may be a suboptimal approach. On the other hand, establishment of an international bankruptcy mechanism holds promise of filling a major gap in the efforts to strengthen the international financial architecture.||Michael Debabrata Patra

This paper, based on fieldwork across the rural areas in three states, probes the Employment Assurance Scheme to understand the state's performance on these parameters as well as aspects of participation, governance and political society. What is revealed is the complexity and divergence of state action - conflicts within and between different agencies of the state, as also the challenges posed to these agencies by civil and political society groups. Also clear is that the participation of the poor in development programmes cannot easily be stepped up in the absence of supporting actors in political society. Part I of the paper presents the initial findings as they relate to the development and empowerment functions of the state. Part II, to be published next week, will develop the argument further through discussion of an 'action research' project that followed on from the authors' 'academic' research.||Stuart Corbridge,Glyn Williams,Manoj Srivastava,Rene Veron

Severe malnourishment is found to be higher in Mumbai than in Jawhar. A connection is postulated between characteristics of urban informal labour markets, specially for women's labour, and the high observed incidence of malnutrition among children. The paper discusses policy mixes for minimising the incidence of malnutrition in this population. A policy that combines income improvement with greater public health facilities and legislation is most likely to succeed in Mumbai. The existing policy of 'slum re-development', if not combined with these other policies, will only induce cosmetic changes and solve the 'problem' of slums only from the point of view of the non-slum population.||Neeraj Hatekar,Sanjay Rode

As a political method it functions on the principle of absolute dualism, permanent war between the good and the evil god and satan. The Ultra Left in Bihar began its career by following the violent path already taken by a number of individuals between 1967 and 1971. It picked up the argument of the 'inevitability of violence' involved in individualised cases of resistance and turned it into a 'party-line', a generalised political wisdom, into a social good. Not surprisingly, in the Ultra Left's extreme vision there was little space for self-criticism, doubts, ambivalence and thus for dialogue and democracy itself. Today the Ultra Left, unable to break the vicious circle of violence, is doomed to follow the politics of marginality.||Arun Kumar

This paper explores the cross-country variation in income inequality based on relatively more comparable data and suggests that public policy aimed at reducing inequality and freedom may be the key variables that explain the variation in the Gini across countries. Prospects for launching national policy initiatives to reduce inequalities are rather dim since globalisation could be conveniently used to rationalise a relatively high level of income inequality.||Bhanoji Rao

The study of both poverty and inequality has been closely associated with an interest in economic and social change. But poverty and inequality do not change at the same pace, and they may even change in opposite directions. It is difficult to make any meaningful statement about the relationship between the two without specifying which conception of poverty and which aspect of inequality one has in mind.||Andre Beteille

The present study aimed at documenting farm-level insights into why hybrid rice has not made a dent on the rice sector in Tamil Nadu. Results show that there was not much progress made over the past decade in terms of developing farmer-acceptable rice hybrids and achieving the higher yield gains through hybrid rice under farmers' field condition in Tamil Nadu.||C.

Our study, using panel data of 572 Indian firms over the period 1989 to 1997, tries to capture various signals of firm quality and reputation to check whether quality matters in the export market under perceived quality uncertainty. Panel logit model is fitted on the data to confirm whether these quality and reputation signals have a significant influence in determining the probability of a firm to export in the next year. Our econometric results support the existence of a linkage between the product market and financial market, as a firm's financial decisions may drive product market outcomes.||Sandwip Kumar Das,Arindam Bandyopadhyay

In 1987 a national convention was held of all the stakeholders before we embarked on reforms in telecommunications. Since then many things have happened, some for the better and some for the worse. Statesmanship and justice for all stakeholders demand that there should be another well-planned and structured national convention on telecommunications and information technology.||T. H. Chowdary

In addition to what we inherited, we have made the system even more dysfunctional. There is no limit to the number of colleges which can be affiliated to a university. Nor have any specific rules to earn the status of affiliation been laid down at any stage. Today there are something like a dozen universities which have more than 300 colleges affiliated to them. Some, though not all, of these universities are otherwise good, but what undermines their standing as a university is that they have to carry the unwanted cargo of a large number of affiliated colleges. The discussion in this paper makes two things clear: one, we have been a victim of the affiliating system for far too long; and two, without a decisive intervention by the centre no change can come about.||Amrik Singh

The rise of reactionary politics was itself an outgrowth of different socio-political movements that Gujarat was witness to since the 1970s. It is the absence of any progressive class/caste movement or a new social movement, this paper argues, that has made Gujarat susceptible to experiments with and sustenance of right wing ideologies, especially the politics of the Hindu right.||Aseem Prakash

No single exchange rate regime is most appropriate for all countries and the regime that is appropriate for a particular country may change over time. The stated objective of India's exchange rate policy is managing volatility with no fixed rate target while allowing the underlying demand and supply conditions to determine exchange rate movements over a period. Against this background, the empirical exercise undertaken indicates that monetary policy has been successful in ensuring orderly conditions in the foreign exchange market and containing the impact of exchange rate pass-through effect on domestic inflation. Real shocks are predominantly responsible for movements in real as well as nominal exchange rate; monetary policy shocks have been relatively unimportant. Deviations from uncovered interest parity can be observed suggesting role for sterilised foreign exchange market intervention in ensuring orderly conditions; at the same time, the excess returns are insignificant and get eliminated relatively quickly. Overall, the analysis indicates that exchange rate management in India has been consistent with macroeconomic stability.||R. K. Pattnaik,Muneesh Kapur,S. C. Dhal

These contradictions have been further sharpened by the 73rd constitutional amendment. Though the concept of self-government at the local level has been guaranteed by the Constitution, it has been given a go by in practice by the ruling establishment. Institutional changes brought about by the 73rd amendment have helped create a space at the grass roots level for these contradictions to be challenged by disadvantaged sections. This might create a ground swell demanding autonomy of panchayats to ensure responsive and accountable governance at the local level.||D. Bandyopadhyay,Saila K. Ghosh,Buddhadeb Ghosh

How does this affect the women's spaces in the domestic and public spheres? This paper explores the process of change as a scattered semi-nomadic group of adivasi foragers come together to form a village settlement. Focusing on one family, and one woman among them, it reflects upon whether and how an indigenous democratic fabric and relative gender egalitarianism may be retained in the face of structural changes in the adivasi life worlds. Using a personal narrative, shaped by different 'dialogical levels', the paper traces the dialogical stages through which the 'story' unfolds. It suggests that the narrative as a qualitative research tool may be used to interrogate women's political spaces and to bring the family into development discourse.||Sumi Krishna

The response of the Fund has been to attune its policies to meet these concerns, emphasise aspects such as national ownership, leaving culture, transparency in its operation, independent evaluation and wider consultations. However, the basic limitations of resources, instruments and mandate in meeting the problems arising from volatile financial markets explain some of the persisting concerns. Three major issues are posed here for discussion to meet these concerns and improve the quality of resolving some of the tradeoffs and judgments involved. The first suggestion is to separate the surveillance function from lending, making the former somewhat independent of political processes as well as the weighted voting structure. The second suggestion is to remove the distortion in current voting strength by recognising intra-monetary union trade as not amounting to international trade since neither currency nor trade restrictions are in place and by accepting the Purchasing Power Parity basis of GDP computation. The third suggestion proposes that the Fund be given some authority to create limited but temporary liquidity under certain circumstances, to be "a lender of some resort".||Y. V. Reddy

But growth has decelerated over the last seven years, after peaking in 1995-96. Why is this so? The reforms have narrowly focused on policy-induced restrictions on supply, ignoring the demand constraint due to the cut in public infrastructure investment since the late 1980s and indifferent agricultural performance in the 1990s.

The study brings out significant social and economic aspects of the people living in Delhi's slums, including low level of education of the migrants, gender disparity in economic status, and significant number of households below the poverty line. The results emphasise the need for a positive employment generation policy among urban slum dwellers. There is also a need to generate employment and provide facilities at the origin of migration in order to check the influx into Delhi.||Naveen Kumar,Suresh Chand Aggarwal

This concern is supported by various statistical analyses. This paper shows that the conclusions are sensitive to what measures of attainment are used. In particular, human development indices do not show the same increase in regional inequality. Furthermore, looking at consumption and credit indicators for regions disaggregated below the state level also suggests that inequality trends may not be as bad as suggested by State Domestic Product data, although the greater strength of the economies of the western and southern states emerges in the results. Finally, policy implications within the context of India's evolving federal polity are briefly discussed.||Nirvikar Singh,Laveesh Bhandari,Aoyu Chen,Aarti Khare

The declining importance being assigned to this sector, in stark contrast to developed countries, has created disparities that are increasing over time.

The change, which has largely gone unnoticed, will bring changes in prices at the first stage or even at the retail stage within the ambit of 'manufacture'.

Findings strongly argue for measures that delay marriage and recognise the special vulnerabilities of married adolescent females. There is a need to raise awareness among girls, parents, teachers and community leaders, but more importantly, there is also a need to hold the government accountable for enforcing the legal age of marriage for girls. Further programmes to enhance married girls' autonomy within their marital homes and those that encourage education and generate livelihood opportunities need to be simultaneously developed.||K. G.

Specifically, the following questions are addressed, in the context of Kerala: Which young women work for pay and why? To what extent is a woman's household economic status - especially poverty status - an important determinant of employment, and to what degree does this relationship differ for married and single women? The analysis provides strong evidence for a U-shaped relationship between household economic status (or class status) and women's current employment status. The interplay of economic factors and cultural factors as determinants of women's employment is important both on the supply side of the labour market and women's ability to obtain employment.||Pradeep Kumar Panda

This election has brought about a change in the regime through the popular verdict and to that extent has become instrumental in providing a linkage between the people and the government.

These concerns have been expressed by as progressive and broad-minded persons as Raja Ram Mohun Roy, Sir Syed Ahmed, Swami Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhiji went to the extent of saying that if he had the power and could legislate, he should certainly stop all proselytising. He had several convincing reasons for his persistent and dogged opposition to conversions, which are presented here. After arguing that religious and ethical grounds for conversions are weak and questionable, the article takes up the social and economic grounds for conversions and finds them equally weak and questionable. It is also argued that just as Islam and the whole Muslim society cannot be blamed for the terrorism by a fanatic fringe, similarly Hinduism and the whole Hindu society cannot be blamed for the atrocities on dalits by a few inhuman criminals. It is contended that the basic principles of Hinduism are not at all consistent with casteism and untouchability. If it is possible to quote from Hindu texts as supporting casteism and untouchability, it is equally possible to quote from Muslim texts as supporting violence against non-Muslims and inequality. But in both cases, they would be misinterpretations, for no true religion preaches violence and inhuman conduct.||M. V. Nadkarni

The analysis of development dynamics in the 1990s shows that there has been an all-round decline in the growth of employment. Income growth and incidence of poverty have been extremely uneven across states. Thus a slowing down in the rate of urbanisation and concentrations of demographic growth in developed states seem to be the logical outcome. The process of urbanisation has also become exclusionary in nature, as only a few large cities with a strong economic base are able to raise resources for development, leaving out small and medium towns.||Amitabh Kundu

Firstly, the sex ratio decline among children in the 0-6 age group turns out to be sharper in the urban areas (32 points) than in the rural. Second, the traditional north-south divide stands significantly modified and the 'northernisation' of sex ratios is rapidly taking the urban route. The sharp decline in the urban female/male (f/m) ratios among children cannot be explained away by any of the three popular escape hatches of yesteryears, i e, migration, undercount or biologically ordained high sex ratos at birth. This decline clearly points to one factor, sex selective abortion or female foeticide that has gained currency during the 1980s and more sharply in the 1990s.||Satish B. Agnihotri

This is because the PPA is complicated and confusing. An attempt is made in this article to analyse the PPA and the dimensions of the conflicts and to draw some lessons for policy for the government and strategy for independent power producers (IPPs).||V.

But such 'feminisation' of poverty that finds women facing the brunt of low wages and unemployment is now increasingly a worldwide trend.||Catherine Argiropoulos,Indhu Rajagopal

Issues of food safety, particularly because of the growing trend of using sewage water in peri-urban areas for vegetable cultivation need to be examined carefully.||Sant Kumar,P. K. Joshi,Suresh Pal

It must become a document with analytical content. It must serve to point out the gaps that have emerged in the budgetary process and also offer credible reasons for those gaps. And finally, it must lay out the road-map for the second half of the financial year and specifically spell out corrective action where needed.||Ajit Karnik

Not only because these amounts, as a proportion of plan allocations say, are small, but because the availability of easy aid precludes the necessity of generating own resources and improving efficiency and targeting. Yet, the finance ministry's grandiose pronouncements on this count have not led to any attempt to overhaul its financial management. Nor are NGOs affected by the coming crunch moving towards better management.||Harsh Sethi

However, a visit to these areas reveals the gaps between official claims and ground realities. Most rehabilitation work has ignored people's basic needs. Healing the physical and emotional trauma that has affected most people, especially women, remains to be addresed.||Sakuntala Narasimhan

However, the counter-insurgency regime in the state remains in place, and expenditure on this account will enormously increase the financial burden in the coming years, even as the real sources to make J and K self-sufficient remain blocked. While fiscal autonomy can be read as an expression of a desire to be free, it cannot become a substitute for addressing the fundamental issue of the people's right to decide their own destiny.||Gautam Navlakha

Two commissions, one on tribal matters and the other on forests, are presently reviewing these subjects and this is a golden opportunity for both to meet and resolve all the land issues relating to tribals and forests and the issue of tribal access to their own forest resources which alone can bring peace and prosperity in the tribal areas.||R.

It contains no references to offences relating to tax evasion, smuggling, foreign trade law violations and foreign exchange manipulations on account of these offences. Proceeds of crime relating to these offences, therefore, will remain outside the scope of the new law.||C. Satapathy

It identifies caste as a system of such social stratification and compares the social and economic backwardness of Muslim OBCs with other OBCs. The article suggests separate reservations for Muslim OBCs within the existing reserved quota, as a means to achieve equality and social justice.||Sayyed Zainuddin

Despite the region specific nature of electoral politics and the emergence of distinct identities, however, emerging trends in Indian politics reveal certain commonalities across the country.||Ashutosh Kumar

It also suggests the policy options that developing countries may consider at the Cancun Ministerial Conference on the issue of Trade and Investment. Further, it reflects on the approaches to make different elements of a possible multilateral framework on investment more pro-development and balanced, in case a negotiating mandate is unavoidable at Cancun.||Nagesh Kumar

Some Empirical Evidence from India||The debate on bank capital regulation has in recent years devoted specific attention to the role that bank loan loss provisions play as a part of the overall minimum capital regulatory framework. The new Capital Accord is also attempting to address provisioning practices within a broad capital regulatory framework. This paper contributes to the debate by exploring the available evidence about bank loan loss provisioning in the Indian context. Using data on state-owned banks for the period 1997-2002, we find that banks tend to delay provisioning for bad loans until too late, possibly magnifying the impact of the economic cycles on their income and capital.||Saibal Ghosh,D.

It is a long and impressive list. Mohit Sen, who was felled by a massive cardiac seizure in the first week of May, was a partisan belonging to this series of ideologues who wanted to be nondescript non-kings.||A. M.

It analyses the inter-firm differences in growth rates over a seven-year period. The basic unit is the firm and the study allows for the entry and exit of firms during the sample period. Further, the authors show that not all firms have benefited from the liberalisation measures. There were gainers and losers. The impact of the determinants on growth has not remained constant over the years but has changed during the process of liberalisation.||N. S. Siddharthan,K. Lal
