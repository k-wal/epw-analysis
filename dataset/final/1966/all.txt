II||While there are signs that in some areas the Package Programme is developing along the lines initially defined, these signs are not evident in all the districts nor are they uniform within particular districts. Irrigation facilities and associated services and undertakings have not been developed to a high enough degree in most areas. Fertiliser input is still well below its potential level. This is particularly true of areas which lack irrigation. Credit facilities have yet to grow to the strength necessary to meet the demands of the Programme. [In the first part of the article, which appeared last week, the authors discussed the performance of the Package Programme with reference to irrigation, fertilisers and credit. In this, the concluding part, the discussion of credit facilities is carried further and certain suggestions are made for future policy for the Package Programme.]||C. A. Robertson,G. R. Saini,R. K.

19/11/1966- ||special articles||4357235||Political Role of Panchayati Raj||The drying up of the tradition of sacrifice in Indian politics - a tradition which had provided the Gandhi-Nehru-Patel generation of leaders-was to be expected. For a time the tradition was sustained by the dwindling ranks of the Sarvodaya Group and Vinoba Bhave may be regarded as the last of the leaders in this tradition. Now the community has to look elsewhere for the constant supply of leaders which it needs to take up the responsibilities of political direction. The successful working of Panchayati Raj institutions might create a catchment area for a new political elite. These institutions are capable of inducting into politics new sections of the population to whom their working will give experience in policy making and political bargaining. It might thus be possible to establish a tradition of expertise to replace the tradition of sacrifice.||V. M. Sirsikar

Although in 1965 and 1966 there has been a temporary setback both in the extent and character of import liberalisation, substantial progress had been made earlier on all fronts, including higher prices to both exporters and importers, higher tariffs and expanded aid. By 1964-65 these policies facilitated the removal of direct controls on about 40 per cent of Pakistan's imports and reduction in detailed control over another 35 per cent. While many weaknesses still remain in both the nature and implementation of Pakistan's import policy, a remarkable degree of reform and progress was attained during the Second Plan period.||Philip S.

For simultaneous pursuit of all these objectives peace in the sub-continent was indispensable to the Soviet Union. Hence the Soviet initiative in organising the Tashkent conference, even though in the attempt to be acceptable to both India and Pakistan, the Soviet Union had to play down its earlier support to India on the Kashmir question. The Tashkent agreement has not led to the solution of the Kashmir problem nor even to any marked improvement in relations between India and Pakistan. In the event its permanent achievement appears to have been to establish the Soviet presence in the politics of the sub-continent.||Aswini K. Ray

Inefficiency in this sphere, therefore, would be very costly to the economy. The performance of the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is designed to function as an all-embracing construction agency, has been uneven. What seems to be clearly lacking is an organisational set-up that can best harness the Department's technical talents. By an overhaul of its organisational chart, its channels of responsibility, and its operational modes, the CPWD can become an adequate and capable central agency for all construction projects in the public sector.||K.

It increased to about 16 in 1961 as a result of legislative action, spread of education and changed social mores. If the average age of women at marriage is pushed further up to 20, it is argued in this note, the birth rate would very likely decline by 30 per cent, that is it would come down from the present 40 per thousand of population to about 27.||S.

This represents almost a three-fold increase over the surplus of Rs 475 crores realised from public enterprises in the Third Plan. The contribution of public enterprises as per cent of total public sector resources is expected to rise to 8.5 in the Fourth Plan from 5.5 during the Third. The Perspective Planning Division estimates that the contribution of public enterprises will be about 22 per cent in 1970-71 and over 35 per cent in 1975-76. In view of the increasing importance of public enterprises as a medium of mobilising resources for planned investment, it is necessary to examine the concept of 'surplus from public enterprises' used by the Planning Commission. Such an examination would show that a large part of the so-called surplus from public enterprises is illusory.||B. V. Mehta

The economic historian as well as the political propagandist spoke of the progressive impoverishment of the masses, but that this assertion needed proof, precise and quantitative, was recognised by none until Dadabhai Naoroji presented his estimate of per capita income in 1867-68. He was then followed by a few others who made estimates of income for particular years. Two points of view emerged from these estimates: Naoroji and Digby felt that compared to 1850 the condition of the common man was poorer in 1900, whereas Atkinson, Barring and Curzon presented the picture of a steadily growing economy as a result of better law and order and improved transport and market organisation under British rule. The issue is far from settled yet; before it can be, we need a national income series for the years 1857 to 1947, the period when the country was ruled directly by the British Crown.||G. S.

There is now a fundamental confrontation between the Congress and the Left Communists, the rank and file of the Right CPI being steadily weaned away by its rival. The ruling party seems to have lost the dynamism and resilience, the commanding ideological height, from which, between the second and third elections, it was able to steal the wind out of the economic sails of the Left Opposition. In a new era of polarisation, the Congress is the party of conservation and consolidation, while the Communists have swung back to part of their 1951 partisan programme. The PSP stands forlorn and frustrated, far away from the threshold of power, offering in its manifesto nothing better than to "oppose and expose" the Congress.||C. S.

The results of this admittedly limited study seem to indicate that the threat to exports from the restrictive clauses incorporated in collaboration agreements is more potential than actual. For, as long as the scale of manufacture is not big enough to yield an exportable surplus and the cost of production is too high for the product to be competitive in the international markets, export possibilities will in any case be limited. From this point of view the positive aspect of ensuring that collaboration agreements provide for optimum scale of production, maximum utilisation of capacity, minimum costs, flexibility in output and process design and, above all, effective use of the collaborators' special skills and experience for promoting exports appears more important.||K.

They need not. First, the imports are in response to shortages and rise in prices; they are determined by, and do not determine, domestic foodgrain prices. Second, the gap between internal production and demand is likely to persist for some time; so imported foodgrains can be absorbed without affecting production. But while imports need not necessarily affect internal production, much depends on the pattern of distribution. A State-wise analysis of the pattern of distribution of imported foodgrains shows that it has been such as to have adversely affected production through its impact on prices.||Kalpana Bardhan

Why does an industry, however profitable, increase capacity, when it is not sure of getting materials? And, more significantly, why does an industry, which already has under-utilised capacity, expand capacity instead of first seeking to utilise existing excess capacity? From the explanation suggested it would appear that the existence of under-utilised capacity is the result of deliberate policy decisions by private entrepreneurs.||Prabhat Patnaik

01/10/1966- ||special articles||4357009||Labour Policy in the Fourth Plan||The immediate post-Independence period was marked by the enactment of comprehensive labour legislation and pervasive state intervention in labour matters. Though the Industrial Truce Resolution of 1947 pleaded for "the fullest co-operation between labour and management and stable and friendly relations between them" and for settlement of all disputes "through mutual discussion", state control over labour and managment became in practice the determining factor in industrial relations. The failure of the policy of state intervention and control, however, gradually compelled the Government to revise its labour policy. As the Third Plan stated, "a new approach was introduced to counteract the unhealthy trends and give a more positive orientation to industrial relations, based on moral rather than legal sanctions". This new approach began in 1958 with the Code of Discipline, the Code of Conduct, the emphasis on workers' education and the experiment of worker participation in management. In the Third Plan these codes and schemes were elaborated. The challenge of voluntary regulation was not, however, accepted by labour and management. In the Third Plan the failure of the policy "based on moral rather than legal sanctions", the ineffectiveness of works committees and other pieces of the industrial relations machinery and, not the least, the public sector's deplorable record in industrial relations, created a sense of frustration among labour and management made more acute by the disturbed economic situation and the sharp rise in prices. Against this background the Draft Outline of the Fourth Plan has no clear policies to offer for industrial relations, incentives or wages.||S. D. Punekar

An attempt to draw up an outline of a plan for Assam for the next ten years or so shows up the lack of basic information needed for the purpose and the large number of assumptions that have to be made, explicitly or implicitly, to arrive at estimates of growth of income, investment, employment, etc. Yet without such studies planning at the State level would have to proceed without a definite idea of the direction the economy may be moving in as also of the direction and magnitude of effort needed to arrive at some desired goal in future.

The second party is the Swatantra. For the Congress this means less factionalism within its ranks as dissidents can now find an alternative platform in another politically viable party. For the urban middle classes, who had withdrawn from public life out of frustration with the Congress's ideological commitments, Swantantra offers an avenue of re-entry into politics. But being a newly emerging party, Swatantra tends to be a spearhead of vareigated discontent and lacks cohesion. Will it develop the necessary internal harmony and act as a mature and able opposition party, if it wins a large number of seats in the election?||Anil Bhatt

Nor should there be any great difficulty in interpreting or utilising the 1961 Census working force data. We must begin by acknowledging the fact that the definition of the working force which the 1961 Census followed was a generous one, a gathering up of all the components of the total manpower resources of India. Once this framework is accepted, I see no reason for cavilling at the actual economic activity rates obtained.||Alice Thorner

12/11/1966- ||special articles||4357207||India and Non-Proliferation Treaty||How should India react to the latest Chinese test of a guided missile with a nuclear warhead? The simplest and most popular answer will be that we should give up our present policy of developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes and decide to make the bomb. On the face of it, considerations of security also suggest such a shift in policy because if China, ahead of Western calculations of its progress in nuclear and missile technology, has now achieved an intermediate range of up to 1,500 miles for its missile system, it will not be long before our cities will be sitting ducks for its nuclear warheads. But such a basic shift in policy is easier recommended than carried out. Past experience shows that over-emphasis on security in evolving our nuclear policy is as bad as under-emphasis on it. For instance, if the security problem is taken care of by a joint guarantee by the nuclear powers should India persist in its present policy and sign the proposed treaty on non-proliferation of nuclear weapons? Some of these questions figured in the recent discussions which the British Disarmament Minister, Lord Chalfont, had with the Prime Minister and some senior officials of the External Affairs Ministry in New Delhi.||G.

In contrast to the input-output and material balances techniques the method suggested here is that of simple or multiple regression of output of one sector with the output of one or more of the other sectors which have a bearing on this sector's activity. The regression method is applied to two targets of the Fourth Plan: those of electricity generation and coal output.||T. N. Srinivasan

How strong is the basis of these forecasts? And apart from the total crop magnitudes, what sort of a food supply situation will the urban population face? How will our agriculture-based exports fare? The time has come for making some informed guesses about the answers to these questions. The guesses made in this article are not the best possible; their justification is that they are more likely to be right than wrong, that they improve slightly the state of our knowledge, and that they may provoke someone into making better guesses.||Ashok V.

We are thus faced with a choice among: (a) the present Plan with the expected level of technology but a vastly higher than expected level of unemployment at the end of it (with its socio-economic implications) and doubtful effect on income; (b) the present Plan with the expected increase in employment but with a lower than expected level of technology and productivity and with doubtful effects on income; (c) a larger Plan, not without the strains it involves, but with the prospect of higher income, employment and technology.||Sudhin Kumar Mukhopadhyay

But the converse is not necessarily true. This is seen from the experience of India. An increase in the proportion of the contribution of the tertiary sector to national income can be viewed as an increase in wasteful use of resources and in inequality of distribution of income. If the increase in the proportion is associated with decrease in per capita output of goods, the presumption about wasteful use of resources and inequality becomes stronger still. This is what seems to have happened in India.||Pradhan Harishanker Prasad

Text revised by the author.] Before the 1964 election, the conservatives had attempted to beat the unfavourable public opinion polls by a nice bout of inflation and had left £800 million loss in reserves. In addition, foreign bankers were shaking in their shoes at what the wicked socialist government might do. Wilson was in a very strong position either to devalue or to threaten to devalue. Instead, he discovered that the chastity and dignity of the pound was very dear to him. Contrary to the advice of a number of people, Wilson announced his determination to preserve the pound and so delivered himself and the country into the hands of the most obscuriantist and foolish group in the world - the bankers and ministers of Finance. At one stroke he had jeopardised every single one of the desirable things both social and economic he had claimed to do. The subsequent economic history of the UK could easily be predicted.||Frank Hahn

The observation is particularly relevant to the Indian Foreign Service. The youngest and newest of the civil services, the Indian Foreign Service is rarely kept in the picture during the formulation or appraisal of foreign policy. Nor has it received the attention it deserves as a limb of the Establishment. It has grown like a neglected child, tense to the point of petulance, weighed down by a sense of unwantedness. Very few of the M Ps have the time or patience to study the problems of the Service, got together hurriedly nineteen years ago and maintained haphazardly since then. They have, however, not been deterred on that score from criticising individual deficiencies of our diplomats and officials and generalising them into failures of the Service. And the pet remedy has been to graft on it pensioned-off politicians or superannuated soldiers, leaving trained craftsmen where they are, at the bottom.||G. S. Bhargava

Since the split, the AITUC has been dominated by the right CP and has adopted fairly "responsible" policies. The rightists dominate AITUC partly because the rightist leader, S A Dange, has been able to build up a strong personal following in the organisation which he has led for the past twenty years. But a more important reason lies in the nature of trade union work which is more consistent with the approach of the rightists than with that of the leftists. The leftist approach to trade unionism places greater emphasis on the political requirements of revolution while the rightists realise that flexible approach to day-to-day issue is first necessary to build up a following before the trade union can be used to obtain political power.||Harold Crouch

It is only appropriate, therefore, that the appraisal of Schultz's thesis should come from V M Dandekar, one of our leading agricultural economists. Dandekar attempts more than a simple appraisal of Schultz's book. He attempts something like an alternative description of traditional agriculture in the second part of his article ("Economic and Political Weekly", August 20, 1966). This article attempts to point out, what the author believes to be, some of the weaknesses of Dandekar's criticism of Schultz and of his alternative model of traditional agriculture.||S. N. Mishra

17/9/1966- ||special articles||4356955||Teaching of Economics in India||In the teaching of economics in India, we are faced with very low standard in Indian economics coexistent with a rather high standard (potentially if not actually) in economic theory. This problem has to be solved by a conscious effort on the part of serious teachers and researchers. The difficulty of bridging the gap between economic theory and Indian economics is substantial and cannot be remedied unless economic research in India is directed towards evolving concepts and hypotheses which approximate to the realities of the Indian economic situation. Unfortunately, the new generation of promising economists has been drawn towards a level of abstraction which ill-fits in the Indian context. The problems which are selected by them for serious study are very often alien to the Indian soil. In the absence of a frame appropriate to an understanding of the Indian economy, teachers of economics are tempted to use constructs which have been developed in the West and the results are often disastrous. It is the responsibility of Indian economists to subject these concepts and constructs to critical examination and determine which of them are applicable to Indian economic conditions and to take the further step of evolving new constructs. This is not easily done, but a concerted effort in this direction is necessary if teaching of economics in India is to be more fruitful than it is today.||Ajit Kumar Biswas

There are, however, certain possible sources of error in Gulati's calculations. One such is his assumption that the proceeds of the sale of smuggled gold in India are all converted into foreign exchange at the official rate of exchange. Besides. Gulati's estimate of the quantity of gold annually smuggled into India also needs closer scrutiny.||Philip Thomas

The Project will use the 'triple method' of simultaneous aeromagnetic, electromagnetic and scintillometric surveys. Is 'Project Hard Rock' justified in the present Indian conditions? In the first place, the areas to be covered by this expensive project have been the venues of mining activity for very long and even the well-known deposits of base metals in these areas have not yet been opened up for production. More important, the main use of air-borne mineral surveys is to delimit the most promising areas out of a vast, difficult and inaccessible region, for subsequent detailed investigation. Their necessity is, therefore, unquestionable in, say, Canada for exploring for minerals in virgin territory like the perma-frost region within the Arctic Circle, where labour, skilled and unskilled, is short, where the field season is brief, and where overland communication is difficult. But in the three areas chosen for 'Project Hard Rock' conditions are quite different. Not only have we no shortage of manpower, whether skilled or unskilled, but field work is possible practically throughout the year and the terrain is by no means inaccessible. In short, mineral surveys can be undertaken in these areas just as quickly, to the same standards of accuracy and reliability, and at far less cost by conventional techniques. These will, moreover, provide employment to our army of trained personnel, and will not need any external assistance beyond some equipment.||K. V. Subrahmanyam

17/12/1966- ||special articles||4357361||Balanced Regional Development: Is It Possible?||The stress on regional planning stems from two sources: first, uneven resource-endowments; and second, wide disparities of economic growth and levels of living. But regional planning presumes that there are clear criteria for identifying regions and for measuring development. Theoretically, regions can be demarcated as "homogeneous" "nodal" or "programme" regions. But it is difficult to find a region that is homogeneous with respect to several factors, and unless homogeneity coincides with the administrative unit, the homogeneous region becomes impractical for regional development. Further the existence of a node implies concentration of activity, which in turn leads to the growth of other nodes. It becomes difficult, therefore, to demarcate a single nodal region. In practice the demarcation of a region is therefore more pragmatic and may use all three criteria. Moreover, since income, which is one of the commonest criteria of development, becomes a tenuous measure between economies that have different socio-cultural framework, particular modifitions to this measure have to be borne in mind in making regional comparisons. This paper attempts to note the conceptual framework and tools of analysis adopted for regional planning and to assess how far regional balances are in fact possible.||J. N. Sarma

Those who are conducting the Revolution are aware of and are discussing in an intensive way the problems facing Chinese agriculture and industry. The other aspect of the Revolution is the drive to further politicise the People's Liberation Army. This militates against a possible rise of militarism, fears of which appear to be baseless.||G. P.

24/12/1966- ||special articles||4357388||Export Performance after Devaluation||Is the fall in export earnings after devaluation due to a decline in the volume of exports or in the unit prices of exports? While we have no direct evidence to answer the question one way or the other, if we look at internal prices we find that prices of commodities whose exports are moving have, by and large, risen substantially while prices of those whose exports have fallen are stagnant or even depressed. Thus it would appear that fall in the volume of exports has probably contributed more to the fall in export earnings than decline in unit prices.||Ashok V. Desai

I: The Formal Criteria||This paper attempts to analyse the experience of the Congress party in selecting its candidates for the general elections of 1957 and 1962. The author first describes the criteria employed and procedures adopted for selecting candidates and examines their working in actual operation. He then takes up the pressures and counter-pressures that the party faces at the time of selection of candidates and examines the methods of coping with these pressures. Third, the author identifies in demographic terms the characteristics of those who sought nominations as Congress candidates which may offer some clues to the nature of the support structure that the party has built up. Finally, he describes and evaluates the type of internal authority structure in the party that is revealed by his examination of the process of selection of candidates. The data for the paper are drawn wholly from two States, Bihar and Rajasthan. For reasons of space the paper will be printed in 5 instalments. In this, the first instalment, the author discusses the formal criteria and procedures adopted by the Congress for selecting candidates. The discussion shows that the Congress is still groping for an arrangement to stabilise relationships between the different organisational levels of the party. Although the party's top command has been willing to show deference to the views of the lower level organisations, it has at the same time expressed its apprehension about "unwarranted and unseemly controversies" that such deference gives rise to. It is the conflict between these two tendencies which prevents the Congress from sticking to any one set of procedures. In the second part of the paper, to appear next week, the author will discuss the pressures and counter-pressures at the time of actually selecting the candidates, formal criteria and procedures notwithstanding. [The author wishes to express his deep gratitude to Professor Avery Leiserson for reading and commenting on an earlier draft of this paper. Although he has benefited greatly from Professor Leiserson's suggestions, the author alone is responsible for any shortcomings in the paper.]||Ramashray Roy
24/12/1966- ||special articles||4357392||Reply to Commentaries||The central point of my criticism of Professor Schultz's concept of traditional agriculture is that he has missed the consequences of population growth and it is only through this neglect that he has been able to postulate traditional agriculture as a state of long-term equilibrium. I have argued that if we take into account the consequences of population growth the characteristic condition of traditional agriculture turns out to be not a state of stable equilibrium but a state of continuous deterioration. I should now make it clear that the consequences of population growth are not confined to the below-subsistence sector. They are equally operative in the other sector. Therefore the deterioration proceeds in both the sectors. Nevertheless, it is analytically convenient to keep distinct the processes operative in the two sectors.||V. M. Dandekar

24/9/1966- ||special articles||4356980||"Black Power" and the US Civil Rights Movement||The non-violent civil rights movement in the U S has secured for Negroes legislation for voting rights and for better opportunities for education and employment. However, in practice segregation and discrimination continue. 'Black Power' is the consequence of the frustration of the Negroes. It is a militant turn in the civil rights movement which has the support of working class Negroes. Whether, under the impact of 'Black Power', the movement takes a totally violent complexion depends on whether it gets wise leadership and a more sympathetic response from the whites.||Philip G.

10/9/1966- ||special articles||4356926||Decline of Planning Commission||The failures and difficulties of the Third Plan seem nowhere to have been taken into account in determining the outlines of the Fourth Plan. The tendency is to attribute the failures of the Third Plan to exogenous factors - the Chinese and Pakistani aggressions, the bad harvest of 1965-66 - and to imply that but for these developments all would have been well. As a consequence in determining the size of the plan, assessing the resources available, setting the priorities and detailing the means of achieving targets, the Fourth Plan closely follows the Third. All this points to the lack of sufficient detailed work at the ground level which, in turn, reflects the administrative bias of the organisation and staffing of the Planning Commission.||Arthagnani

24/12/1966- ||special articles||4357393||Rate of Interest and Economic Development||The rate of growth of income is an increasing function of investment. When the actual rate of investment is less than the desired level of investment, the need for planning becomes apparent. While private sector investment depends on several non-economic factors and is a decreasing function of the rate of interest, public sector investment is autonomous. It can be made independently of the higher rate of interest and the quantum of it can more than compensate the fall in the private sector's rate of investment. Given the goal of socialisation of the means of production, a high rate of interest becomes even necessary. However, all this assumes a stable price level. For, an inflationary spiral encourages non-productive holding of inventory and current consumption, and discourages demand for investment. This implies that total investment at any given rate of interest would have been higher if there had been a stable price level. Our continued budget deficits and inflationary financing has, however, broken this basic tenet of economic reasoning.||Pradhan Harishankar Prasad

Since 1961 the economy has been run in a low gear with only short-term and conservative targets. Abroad China's foreign policy has had some severe defects. The prospect that faces the country's leadership is very different from the triumphs of 1964 when China was chasing the Soviet Union hard. Unsuccessful intransigence abroad makes necessary a continuously intensified campaign at home and since real economic campaigns have had to be ruled out ideological campaigns must take the whole strain. It is in this situation that the genesis of the ideological purge of the Chinese communist party is to be found.||John Ashdown

However, this modern sector had not yet become large enough to affect the overall structure of the economy. Largescale manufacturing industry was the only sector of the economy to adopt advanced modern techniques to a marked extent so as to affect the capital structure of the sector as a whole. In other sectors, inspite of there being a rise in the incremental capital-output ratios, the overall capital-output structure remained largely unchanged.||Uma Datta Roy Choudhury

26/11/1966- ||special articles||4357267||Necessary Elements of a Food Policy||The core of an adequate food policy aimed at holding the price line, ensuring equitable distribution and managing without large imports has necessarily to be the curtailment of demand. Extensive statutory rationing in the urban areas should, therefore, form the crucial element in the policy. Decisions on other aspects of the 'integrated food policy', like restrictions on movement of foodgrains, etc, must be taken in the light of the contribution they make to the success of rationing. A policy mainly aimed at defeating the speculator, even if it could be carried out effectively which is doubtful, is likely in the present circumstances to remain inadequate.

The responsibility for the views expressed is, however, entirely mine.]||Abdul Majid

A crucial question is: how much should the country import to build up adequate stocks? Imports add to total availability, while procurement merely has distributional effects and is comparatively unpopular. The Government must then weigh the unpopularity of procurement against the cost of cereal imports. Has any systematic attempt in fact been made to assess the quantity of imports necessary or have the imports been made on an ad hoc or political basis? At attempt is made in this article to examine the theoretical basis of the present food policy and to offer an alternative policy.||Romesh K. Diwan

The Government, therefore, has to directly manage food distribution. In the policy recommendations of the Committee procurement of a substantial part of total output for distribution by the Government has a pivotal role. An attempt is made here to examine the implications of large-scale Government procurement for the prices paid to producers, and consequently, for incentives to raise production. Low income groups have, of course, to be supplied foodgrains at prices lower than market prices. But should the subsidy come from producers of foodgrains through lower-than free-market procurement prices or from the community at large through taxation?||C. H. Shah

24/9/1966- ||special articles||4356981||The Fourth Five Year Plan||One should expect the Planning Commission to have underlined shortcoming of the earlier Plans, to have analysed their underlying causes and to have pronounced on the nature of change that would be called for in order that these shortcomings were not perpetuated. Instead, one finds the Commission putting up before the public a Plan which is just a repetition of the earlier ones, with all kinds of pious promises incorporated. The figures are altered in absolute terms, but the growth rate envisaged remains about the same as in the previous Plans - 5.5 per cent cumulative. I would not for a moment suggest that the aggregate investment contemplated, which would amount to just about 15-16 per cent of the national income, would be an impossibility, provided a 5.5 per cent cumulative growth rate was realized. Yet, I would ask myself-what has happened to our economy and what new things have been prescribed in our "Draft Outline" which would make the situation so drastically different during the coming five years from what it has been in the past? Let us not forget that the per capita income, as estimated by the Planning Commission, is just the same today as it was five years back. From this point of view we are indeed starting from exactly the same position as we were in when the Commission formulated the Third Five Year Plan. What institutional changes are contemplated which would make mobilization of finance easier now than it was before, and what efficiency factor is dropped in, which would make our capital co-efficient in industry as well as in agriculture significantly higher in future than it has been till now? One would expect the Planning Commission to answer these questions. The Draft Outline of the Fourth Plan does nothing of the sort.||A. K. Das Gupta

31/12/1966- ||special articles||4357417||Traditional Caste Systems as Involute Systems: A Note on the Washermen of a Village in Rajasthan||F G Bailey, while referring to caste systems in "traditional Indian society" endorses Fredrik Barth's view that caste systems are involute systems in the sense that one status for a caste necessarily implies a series of other equivalent statuses. In modern India, however, Bailey believes that systems have ceased to be involute because, according to him, "the village provided a boundary at which relations turned inwards..... Nowadays people have an economic and political relationship beyond that boundary. By this route castes which are ritually or politically low in the village may become wealthy". The discussion in this note suggests that at least in the village studied by the author relations between castes did not suggest an involute system. It is not the author's intention to conclude from this that traditional caste systems all over India were not involute. But it may at least be said that they need not always have been so. What is suggested here is that the conception of traditional caste systems as involute systems can at best be treated as a hypothesis for investigation.||Anand Chakravarti

Nevertheless, the country would continue to incur a sizeable cost purely because of the fact that India is prepared to import only smuggled gold for non-monetary purposes. Is there an alternative to importing smuggled gold? It is suggested in this paper that there is an alternative; a simple one that is quite practical too.

By continuing to follow their original Hindu tradition they maintained their dominant land-owning position in the Hindu caste structure. At the same time they protected themselves from the wrath of powerful Muslim rulers by nominal adoption of Islam. In recent years, however, gradual break-up of the Jajmani arrangements and a tendency of the subcastes towards wider integration has made it necessary for the Meos also to change. Because partition stiffened the attitude of Hindus towards them, the Meos were virtually forced into greater Islamization in order to participate in the widening contacts.||Partap C. Aggarwal

Unlike Schultz, Dandekar in his model of traditional agriculture treats population as an exogenous factor which does not reach a state of equilibrium but continues to grow more or less independently of the stock of capital. By treating population as an exogenous factor, it is contended here, Dandekar has missed the economic impact of population growth.||Tara Shukla

The econometric application of probability theory is an example of the use of hypothetical populations in situations where no means exist of the hypotheses being tested. The purpose with which probability is applied in economics is scientific inference as opposed to sequential decision-making with the purpose of ensuring a certain profitability in the long run. As such, it is the logical view of probability that is relevant to economics and not the frequency interpretation which happens to be the basis of the statistical tools made use of by econometricians.||Ashok Rudra

It is this day to day support which ensures orderly conditions in the Indian exchange market and permits satisfactory conduct of the country's international transactions. The basic framework of the Reserve Bank's system of exchange support was developed some 25 years ago in the context of special war-time conditions and of a closely-knit sterling area system as it existed then and has acquired considerable rigidity and lost much of its original justification. As it exists today the system suffers from serious weaknesses besides exposing the Central Bank to major exchange risks. The devaluation of the rupee on June 6, 1966, presented an opportunity for moving towards a new system of support but the authorities have decided to leave the existing arrangements virtually undisturbed. This article outlines an alternative policy frame-work which will make possible a gradual break with the past. However, the principal object of this submission is not so much to argue the case for one particular alternative system as to provoke further informed public discussion from bankers and others on an important though a somewhat neglected aspect of national policy.||S.

03/12/1966- ||special articles||4357293||Why Land Revenue Must Not Be Abolished||There is no case for complete abolition of land revenue even if it is combined with the extension of the present income tax on agricultural incomes. It would be a retrograde tax measure from the point of view of securing optimal land use. Land acreage, as adjusted appropriately for its normal productivity, and not year to year production, is a distinctly better base for assessment to tax than current agricultural income because a tax thus linked to land would encourage land development and maximum exploitation of its potential. There is, however, a good case for the exemption of small holdings from land revenue on the ground of equity, productivity and economy. The case becomes even stronger when the proposal is combined with progressive taxation of large holdings. But this progression is best introduced within the framework of the existing land revenue system.

03/9/1966- ||special articles||4356897||Sociological Studies in India||The influence of the British academic tradition on Indian education is responsible for the relatively undeveloped character of sociology in India. Sociology was not regarded as respectable by Indian intellectuals who looked up to Oxford and Cambridge for providing them with their standards and ideals. It was only after Independence and the launching of the programme of planned development that a widespread need was felt for sociological research. Since Independence several important field studies of villages have been carried out by sociologists, Indian and foreign. But the pace of social change in India has been such that villages are increasingly affected by forces outside and the growing links between villages and towns have forced sociologists to study the process of urbanisation and even the urban centres themselves. Problems in political sociology and the analysis of the role of non-economic factors in development are also beginning to receive attention.||M. N. Srinivas

Urbanisation as a process of inter-action between town and country may be studied in terms of rural-urban relations, that is, in terms of participation of villagers in the social and cultural life of the town and vice versa, and in terms of inter-personal relations between villagers and town dwellers. Here the author is concerned with the process of urbanisation from the standpoint of villages.||M. S. A. Rao
15/10/1966- ||special articles||4357074||What Is Wrong with Our Irrigation Projects?||As part of the programme to increase agricultural production the Planning Commission has envisaged that eventually 112 million acres should be brought under irrigation in the country. But the capital cost of irrigation per acre is extremely high and of the irrigation potential already created, a significant portion remains unutilised. It is argued here that costs can be controlled by policy decisions and execution being governed strictly by technical considerations. Construction of water-courses should be simultaneous with that of the main project and use of irrigation facilities should be made obligatory.||K. M. Bhatia

But it will also raise their domestic prices, lead to little or no expansion in their outputs, reduce the exports of certain other commodities by raising adverse expectations and, in the long run, put inflationary pressure on the economy to necessitate more subsidies, with or without proportionately larger investments flowing into these industries.||Mrinal Datta-Chaudhuri
