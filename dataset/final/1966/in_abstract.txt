There is now a fundamental confrontation between the Congress and the Left Communists, the rank and file of the Right CPI being steadily weaned away by its rival. The ruling party seems to have lost the dynamism and resilience, the commanding ideological height, from which, between the second and third elections, it was able to steal the wind out of the economic sails of the Left Opposition. In a new era of polarisation, the Congress is the party of conservation and consolidation, while the Communists have swung back to part of their 1951 partisan programme. The PSP stands forlorn and frustrated, far away from the threshold of power, offering in its manifesto nothing better than to "oppose and expose" the Congress.||C. S.

But the capital cost of irrigation per acre is extremely high and of the irrigation potential already created, a significant portion remains unutilised. It is argued here that costs can be controlled by policy decisions and execution being governed strictly by technical considerations. Construction of water-courses should be simultaneous with that of the main project and use of irrigation facilities should be made obligatory.||K. M. Bhatia
