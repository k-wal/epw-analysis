Though technically they are citizens of the country, empirically they are refugees, and their exact numbers are still to be estimated. Their deplorable condition in the camps and general neglect suggests that the state is not bothered.||Monirul Hussain

This essay engages with the nature of urban modernity in India while historicising the debates over the environment in Delhi. The issues and practices bundled together as "environmental", around which strategies and tactics are organised, shift through time. Infrastructure and public health; nuisance and noxious trades; pollution and zoning; standards and technoscience; and environmentalism through legal rights, leave their distinct imprints on how we dwell in the city. An environmental injury, perhaps, does not lie in Nature alone and must be apprehended through frameworks that render these injuries intelligible. The attention to these shifting registers shall help to link planning and environment both to power and to an anthropology of the urban modern in India.||Awadhendra Sharan

But the Korean way is neither commendable nor reproducible for ethical, economic and social reasons. Korea achieved the recorded results under a harshly repressive dictatorship protected by the US. It developed a productivist model that completely disregarded environmental considerations. A close examination of the Korean model of development.||Eric Toussaint

His initiatives in the village of Ralegan Siddhi have inspired the state government to replicate them in neighbouring villages, to make all of them 'adarsh gaon' or "ideal villages". This success also has a lot to do with Anna's personality and the authority that he exercises in his village, which is both absolute and complex. It is characterised by culture, tradition and religion, including much persuasion and notably, some coercion.||Mukul Sharma

The general stability of a coastal system, including that of its socio-economic and biophysical environment, depends on the nature of human-mangrove relationships. But official conservation strategies very often intervene in the process by imposing restrictions on fishing and mangrove use. The present study analyses and quantifies the socio-economic impact of such restrictions on local economic activities and per capita income of a mangrove dependant coastal population on the east coast of India. Restrictions have led to instability of the local economy in the concerned villages, which may pose a risk of further denudation of forests, making the goal of a holistic management approach even further unrealisable.||Rajarshi Mitra,Rabindra N.

It explores the democratic political avenues used by those whose business opportunities and livelihoods were at risk, based largely on market participation and caste identity, to resist this legislation. The research is based on interviews and informal discussions conducted over an extensive period of time spent in the neighbourhood of the wholesale plastic recycling market in north-west Delhi and amongst the "elite establishment" - government officials, primary plastic industry members and others. As it appears, not only is caste identity thriving in the urban sphere, but this identity is actually being used in innovative ways to gain and maintain collective access to economic and political power.||Kaveri Gill

But this energy-intensive technology would be responsible for greenhouse gas emissions and uncontrolled brine discharges. It will also encourage social and environmental dumping. Ultimately, the issue is the purpose to be served by the desalination plant and who it will primarily (not) benefit.||Gregor Meerganz von Medeazza

The Indian government views the yearning for moksha (salvation) that takes so many devotees to the challenging heights of Kashmir as "a fitting gesture of solidarity with our valiant soldiers", elevating the pilgrimage to a patriotic enterprise. A bigger mess seems to be in the making even as secular concerns go unheeded.||Gautam Navlakha

This paper argues that the ecologically damaging resource use behaviour, which precedes environmental degradation, has to do with the user's access to natural resources. If access to natural resources is uneven, it can cause destructive use behaviour, motivated by surplus production and compelled by subsistence needs. Using the case of Pakistan, this paper shows that the size of holdings and tenurial status of farmers are two determinants of what has been termed "overshoot" of natural resource use. The deepening social divide in Pakistan, it appears, is worsening the "ecological divide", imperilling the country's economic growth in the near- and long-term. The paper makes an ecological argument that Pakistan can bridge the ecological divide by closing the social divide, which, in turn, requires it to widen the access of its land-short and landless farmers to farmland.||Tarique Niazi

Part II begins by examining the developments in environmental history that in the 1950s had their roots in the nexus that had developed in the 1930s between world history, the 'Annales' school of history and aspects of local history as well. Scholars of environmental history in this period also came under the towering influence of the historian Arnold Toynbee, whose narratives and explanations of the global cyclical movements in world history. Toynbee's later writings imparted a new ecological and internationalist direction to world history. The latter 1950s saw the spread of environmental history to scholars in other countries and an admixture of different disciplines and specialisations gave a new thrust to the subject. Earlier histories of imperialism and colonialism now began to be looked at a new from their impact on the environment and the ecology.||Richard Grove,Vinita Damodaran

A common perception is that air quality policies were prescribed by the Supreme Court, and not by an institution with the mandate for making environmental policy. A careful review of the policy process in Delhi suggests otherwise. We find that the government was intimately involved in policy-making and that the main role of the Supreme Court was to force the government to implement previously announced policies. A good understanding of what happened is essential, as the Delhi experience for instituting change has become a model for other Indian cities as well as neighbouring countries.||Urvashi Narain,Ruth Greenspan Bell

It then asks the question as to why this project has been launched despite apparent weaknesses. The paper shows that IRLP is a culmination of the commercial approach to rivers that sees rivers as objects to be "conquered" and "consumed". The paper notes that time and experience have made this approach outmoded, and a new, ecological approach towards rivers has emerged. According to this approach, rivers should be appreciated for what they are, i e, as progenitor of various ecosystems and cultures. The ecological approach encourages harvesting river resources in a way that does not affect fundamentally the natural course and flow of rivers and the ecosystems and cultures they sustain. The paper notes that, in view of their strong tradition of reverence towards rivers, the people of south Asia can play a prominent role in championing the ecological approach.||Nazrul Islam

This paper examines the functioning of PCBs, in particular the Central Pollution Control Board and Andhra Pradesh Pollution Control Board to see if they have been able to prevent environmental externalities in the process of economic development. It finds that the agencies have been unable to improve environmental quality effectively because of an increase in their responsibilities, absence of deterrence mechanisms and inadequate human and financial resources.||P.

For nearly a century from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century, the discipline developed primarily in the from of "historical geography". A new phase of global environment history began with European decolonisation from the 1950s onwards. The imminence of a nuclear catastrophe and pesticide pollution stimulated the rise of a worldwide and populist environmental movement that reached full fruition in the 1970s. This article in two parts traces the beginnings and the shifting discourse of environmental history. Part I looks at the origins till the period of the 1930s. It was a time when the colonial encounter was becoming increasingly frayed, but environmental history benefited from the innovative convergence of writings on the part of geographers, archaeologists and ecologists, several of whom took an increasingly anxious and prescriptive view of human-environment interactions. Part II will appear next week.||Richard Grove,Vinita Damodaran

But structural reforms, technological upgradation and proactive responses by industry and government can provide an enabling environment to meet the challenges of trade liberalisation and environmental protection. The paper compares and contrasts the responses of the leather industry to these challenges, by stage or production, in Brazil, China and India.||U. Sankar

But when such projects are considered for implementation, they raise many problems and controversies that may challenge the planners, policy-makers and institutional procedures. This paper analyses the environmental and ecological impact of existing inter-basin water transfer projects in Canada and examines the water policy-making procedures, water laws as well as other decision-making criteria.||Deepak Kumar Das

But such an exercise is needed to understand the possibilities and limitations of policy pronouncements and legislative action, given the current politico-economic disposition. This is an attempt to fill that void and explores the changing nature of environment policy-making and the shifts in the manner in which social concerns are addressed.||Ajit Menon

The global growth of human population and production in terms of monetary flows (GDP) are complemented with data that demonstrate the ecological "embeddedness" of human economic activities. The article assembles data drawn from the literature and from unpublished work to draw a first, still sketchy, picture of major trends during the last 300 years. The analysis is based on three global regions, the industrial core, east Europe and the former Soviet Union and the developing countries. The analysis is based on the socio-economic metabolism concept, in particular material and energy flow accounting. The findings suggest that resource constraints as well as limits to the capacity of the biosphere to safely absorb emissions and waste will not permit a global transition towards the industrial society according to the pattern currently observable in the industrial core.||Helmut Haberi,Fridolin Krausmann,Simone Gingrich

To overcome this crisis, one should accept that there is nothing unethical in making extensive use of service taxes/user charges or delivering civic and other developmental services to the poor. One such area which has a high tax potential and tax buoyancy and remains untapped by many states is common property resources. This paper discusses the different dimensions of such resources in our panchayats, their utilisation status, their extent, the hurdles and roadblocks in exploiting them, management and environmental concerns from different stakeholders' viewpoints, and it lists observations and recommendations of a blueprint for the future.||Subroto Dhar

In recent decades, most governments around the world, bowing to sustained pressure from civil society organisations, have either legislated on or signed up to a broader universal convention promising access and transparency on environmental matters. These struggles have been varied, and in some instances, the laws enacted come couched with restrictive clauses; notwithstanding this, the struggle for assuring freedom of information has had the added benefit of raising awareness levels, even of those considered illiterate. For the future, as environmental deterioration threatens the very future of the world, what is required is global action that could facilitate the free flow of information across borders and nations.||Misha Singh,Shekhar Singh

Historical scholarship explains poor agricultural growth mainly in terms of adverse institutions, a hypothesis that fails to account for the much better growth rates in pre-war India. A contemporary discourse suggesting the presence of environmental constraints on investment in agriculture, and sustainability of extensive growth, supplies a better account of economic history. It can also connect the past with the present, when sustainability concerns have returned.||Tirthankar Roy

Through the study of the urban local body, a private agency and a civil society organisation engaged in this activity, the paper highlights issues related to effectiveness and equity, role of the urban poor in this service, and the relevance of an effective policy framework. In the context of increasing private sector participation in public service provision, and global awareness related to the impact of urban footprints on the planet, the study brings out some interesting lessons on the nature of public-private partnerships in SWM, and the role of the state in guaranteeing social and ecological equity and accountability. It also points to the urgent need for a change in the way the state itself approaches solid waste management, stressing policy mandates that will enforce equitable and ecologically sustainable waste management practices across the country. The study is based on qualitative research methodology, and involved in-depth interactions and discussions with residents, agency officials and conservancy workers, detailed examinations of secondary literature on SWM systems, and intensive field observation of SWM processes in the three agencies in Chennai.||Krithika Srinivasan

However, technologies like nanotechnology should be supervised as they pose potential environmental risks and health hazards.

It lists the items and examines the structure of trade for select countries including India. The analysis shows that while there is no agreement on an acceptable definition of environmental goods, a number of submissions on the list of items that could be categorised as such have been proposed, with an emphasis on greater reduction commitments under the WTO agreements. It is observed that a number of environmental goods that are of export interest to developing countries like India have been left out and at the same time a large number of other items that are not strictly in the realm of environmentally preferable goods are included. Hence, a decision at the WTO would have to be suitably negotiated such that there is a consensus on the conceptual parameters for environmental goods while giving member countries the leverage to decide on the list of environmentally preferred commodities, as per their domestic requirement and export interests.||Archana S.
