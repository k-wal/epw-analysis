It also exposes the inability of political democracy, as we know it, to address weaknesses in law and governance. The state government meekly surrendered the opportunity that the struggle bestowed at the altar of the judiciary, rather than take advantage of it for bold political decision-making. The Plachimada struggle calls for the recovery of the commons by communities.||C. R. Bijoy

This is a pilot study from a small area, so that results call for larger surveys to more reliably estimate water demand curves. Larger surveys would also enable us to examine additional issues like how efficient is water allocation in surface irrigation systems; do marginal water values vary much more between river basins than within river basins; if not, then the rationale for inter-basin transfers becomes less compelling.||E.

This essay engages with the nature of urban modernity in India while historicising the debates over the environment in Delhi. The issues and practices bundled together as "environmental", around which strategies and tactics are organised, shift through time. Infrastructure and public health; nuisance and noxious trades; pollution and zoning; standards and technoscience; and environmentalism through legal rights, leave their distinct imprints on how we dwell in the city. An environmental injury, perhaps, does not lie in Nature alone and must be apprehended through frameworks that render these injuries intelligible. The attention to these shifting registers shall help to link planning and environment both to power and to an anthropology of the urban modern in India.||Awadhendra Sharan

The general stability of a coastal system, including that of its socio-economic and biophysical environment, depends on the nature of human-mangrove relationships. But official conservation strategies very often intervene in the process by imposing restrictions on fishing and mangrove use. The present study analyses and quantifies the socio-economic impact of such restrictions on local economic activities and per capita income of a mangrove dependant coastal population on the east coast of India. Restrictions have led to instability of the local economy in the concerned villages, which may pose a risk of further denudation of forests, making the goal of a holistic management approach even further unrealisable.||Rajarshi Mitra,Rabindra N.

It explores the democratic political avenues used by those whose business opportunities and livelihoods were at risk, based largely on market participation and caste identity, to resist this legislation. The research is based on interviews and informal discussions conducted over an extensive period of time spent in the neighbourhood of the wholesale plastic recycling market in north-west Delhi and amongst the "elite establishment" - government officials, primary plastic industry members and others. As it appears, not only is caste identity thriving in the urban sphere, but this identity is actually being used in innovative ways to gain and maintain collective access to economic and political power.||Kaveri Gill

This article examines the nature of the ongoing debate from four key perspectives: incompatibility of conservation and development, viability of strict protection in the current circumstances, moral and economic arguments for conservation and the prevalent orthodoxy of conservation-friendly communities. Despite these limitations, community-based conservation is here to stay. The real issue is not whether communities should be involved, but rather how such involvement can be made effective. Protection of biodiversity must be based on a wide range of approaches to develop a shared understanding of compatible conservation and development goals at various levels.||Chetan Kumar

This paper discusses the extent to which these changes have been equitable, with a particular focus on equity across different landholding categories. The equity outcome in Hivre Bazar is better than in many other watershed programmes, mainly due to the use of watershed-plus and other attenuating measures. As such, it is a good example of how certain kinds of equity concerns can be taken up and implemented with local initiative. However, there are also limitations in the equity outcome, which raise important questions for future water interventions.||Priya Sangameswaran

Although the use of high-yielding varieties has brought huge gains in yield, variability is still a formidable production risk in a rain-fed environment. Estimates show that the intensity of drought is higher during the maximum tillering stage of rice production, emphasising the need for developing drought-resistant rice varieties. It is imperative that the varieties meant for a water limiting environment should ensure minimal level of yield during the stress period and this could induce the farmers to go for a higher level of adoption. Continued research on development of drought-tolerant rice varieties and seed supply management are crucial.||K. N. Selvaraj,C. Ramasamy

This paper argues that the ecologically damaging resource use behaviour, which precedes environmental degradation, has to do with the user's access to natural resources. If access to natural resources is uneven, it can cause destructive use behaviour, motivated by surplus production and compelled by subsistence needs. Using the case of Pakistan, this paper shows that the size of holdings and tenurial status of farmers are two determinants of what has been termed "overshoot" of natural resource use. The deepening social divide in Pakistan, it appears, is worsening the "ecological divide", imperilling the country's economic growth in the near- and long-term. The paper makes an ecological argument that Pakistan can bridge the ecological divide by closing the social divide, which, in turn, requires it to widen the access of its land-short and landless farmers to farmland.||Tarique Niazi

Part II begins by examining the developments in environmental history that in the 1950s had their roots in the nexus that had developed in the 1930s between world history, the 'Annales' school of history and aspects of local history as well. Scholars of environmental history in this period also came under the towering influence of the historian Arnold Toynbee, whose narratives and explanations of the global cyclical movements in world history. Toynbee's later writings imparted a new ecological and internationalist direction to world history. The latter 1950s saw the spread of environmental history to scholars in other countries and an admixture of different disciplines and specialisations gave a new thrust to the subject. Earlier histories of imperialism and colonialism now began to be looked at a new from their impact on the environment and the ecology.||Richard Grove,Vinita Damodaran

A common perception is that air quality policies were prescribed by the Supreme Court, and not by an institution with the mandate for making environmental policy. A careful review of the policy process in Delhi suggests otherwise. We find that the government was intimately involved in policy-making and that the main role of the Supreme Court was to force the government to implement previously announced policies. A good understanding of what happened is essential, as the Delhi experience for instituting change has become a model for other Indian cities as well as neighbouring countries.||Urvashi Narain,Ruth Greenspan Bell

It then asks the question as to why this project has been launched despite apparent weaknesses. The paper shows that IRLP is a culmination of the commercial approach to rivers that sees rivers as objects to be "conquered" and "consumed". The paper notes that time and experience have made this approach outmoded, and a new, ecological approach towards rivers has emerged. According to this approach, rivers should be appreciated for what they are, i e, as progenitor of various ecosystems and cultures. The ecological approach encourages harvesting river resources in a way that does not affect fundamentally the natural course and flow of rivers and the ecosystems and cultures they sustain. The paper notes that, in view of their strong tradition of reverence towards rivers, the people of south Asia can play a prominent role in championing the ecological approach.||Nazrul Islam

A substantial decrease in the annual rate of growth of grain production in the last decade (to a value of less than 1 per cent from the 2.7 per cent prevailing until the 1990s) suggests that self-sufficiency in foodgrains may not be sustained without changes in strategies. A significant finding is the observed asymmetry in the response to monsoon variation, with the magnitude of the impact of deficit rainfall on GDP and grain production being larger than the impact of surplus rainfall. We find that despite a substantial decrease in the contribution of agriculture to GDP over the five decades, the impact of severe droughts has remained between 2 and 5 per cent of GDP throughout. We have suggested that a possible reason for the relatively low response of grain production to average or above average monsoon rainfall post-1980 is that the strategies which would allow farmers to reap benefits of the rainfall in good monsoon years are not economically viable in the current milieu. The experience of the monsoon season of 2006 suggests that losses due to floods, caused in part by the sudden release of the water stored in the reservoirs of dams may be another important factor.||Sulochana Gadgil,Siddhartha Gadgil

It argues that the current exclusionary logic, as manifested at Madhav, is flawed. Biodiversity is rapidly diminishing. Autocratic governance precipitates alienation among the lower strata of local people and contributes to illegal resource expropriation. Park policy ignores locally-embedded ability to protect biodiversity and willingness to be educated to that end. There is a pressing need for biological protection at Madhav but severe deprivation also exists in the area. Consequently, site-specific strategies are required that build not solely upon biology or economics but combine these concerns with sensitivity to the lower strata of people that live around the park and to the potential social, material and cultural costs of conservation policies.||Kim Beazley

The major traditionally discussed factors of conflict around international waters have been the riparian structure associated benefits and disadvantages, sovereignty notions, upstream-downstream diverging interests and regional power hierarchy. However, these factors are fairly stable for a long period of time in a given basin. These geopolitical or "space" centric explanations allocate too much emphasis on locations, thus draw unilinear and almost permanent conclusions. The basin states, instead of being passive recipients, keep interacting over resources as self-seeking political units for maximising their net benefits. This paper analyses these interactions through the example of Ganga water dispute between the two co-riparian nations - India and Bangladesh.||Rakesh Tiwary

For nearly a century from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century, the discipline developed primarily in the from of "historical geography". A new phase of global environment history began with European decolonisation from the 1950s onwards. The imminence of a nuclear catastrophe and pesticide pollution stimulated the rise of a worldwide and populist environmental movement that reached full fruition in the 1970s. This article in two parts traces the beginnings and the shifting discourse of environmental history. Part I looks at the origins till the period of the 1930s. It was a time when the colonial encounter was becoming increasingly frayed, but environmental history benefited from the innovative convergence of writings on the part of geographers, archaeologists and ecologists, several of whom took an increasingly anxious and prescriptive view of human-environment interactions. Part II will appear next week.||Richard Grove,Vinita Damodaran

In this context, this study made an attempt to assess the human-related constraints in management in the Peechi-Vazhani Wildlife Sanctuary, Kerala. It reveals that the constraints relate mainly to an insufficient attention paid to involving local communities and others who care about the protected area in planning, management and decision-making for the area, the social and economic dependencies of the local communities that conflict with the objectives of the PA.||V.

Fitting Water Policy to National Development Context||Water scarcity has emerged, especially during the past decade, as an important theme in discussions on India's future. Global discourse suggests that India, and other developing countries in Asia and Africa, can respond to water scarcity - and the resultant water poverty facing their people - by embracing integrated water resources management, a package of best practices for improved management of water resources with strong emphasis on direct demand-side management. This paper addresses five questions about the IWRM paradigm with respect to India: (1) Is water poverty of countries caused by their water scarcity? (2) Would embracing IWRM help alleviate India's water poverty? (3) Is implementing IWRM feasible in India in today's context? (4) Has implementing IWRM helped counter water scarcity and poverty in other countries with a development context comparable to India's? And, finally, (5) What should be the priorities and roadmap for improving the working of the water sector in India? The paper reviews recent evidence from around the world to analyse these questions and concludes with a discussion of implications for water sector reform discussions in India.||Tushaar Shah,Barbara van Koppen

Fourteen 'bastis' have been identified as being affected by groundwater pollution. However, no correlation appears to be established between the health conditions of the residents and water contamination, as various surveys and estimates are not conclusive and agencies are bickering over evidence. A health survey by a national agency of repute must be conducted to establish the basis for further action while the acute shortage of water itself is tackled.||Betwa Sharma

But when such projects are considered for implementation, they raise many problems and controversies that may challenge the planners, policy-makers and institutional procedures. This paper analyses the environmental and ecological impact of existing inter-basin water transfer projects in Canada and examines the water policy-making procedures, water laws as well as other decision-making criteria.||Deepak Kumar Das

But such an exercise is needed to understand the possibilities and limitations of policy pronouncements and legislative action, given the current politico-economic disposition. This is an attempt to fill that void and explores the changing nature of environment policy-making and the shifts in the manner in which social concerns are addressed.||Ajit Menon

The question is whether the state is actually retreating from its responsibilities or is reworking its governance strategy in sensitive areas. In the case of Jharkhand, for instance, the bill seeks an "easy" conversion of forest into revenue villages even as it places the onus of conservation of the forest dwellers and scheduled tribes.||Ritambhara Hebbar

The new Scheduled Tribes (Recognition of Forest Rights) Bill needs to be contextualised in the ground reality of conflicting interests and claims. First, the category of scheduled tribes is contested in social science discourse. Second, forest and tribal policy in India is not adequately sensitive to value systems of local communities and this creates considerable contestation between administration and the local people. This paper revisits these contestations in the worldwide body of academic discourse. There has been fair consensus in the literature that value systems and customary institutions of local communities have well-developed mechanisms that regulate sustainable lifeways and conserve local ecosystems, though unquestioning acceptance of these may also lead to errors. What is required is for policy to effectively deliver benefits to people and conserve biological diversity, and it is anthropologists who can mediate a dialogic space between the people, their civil society institutions, networks of advocacy, public and local intellectuals, the academia, policy and governance.||Arnab Sen,Esther Lalhrietpui

They are aggravated by the relative paucity of frameworks, policies and mechanisms to govern use of water resources. This collection of articles, part of a larger compendium, is an attempt to offer analyses of different aspects of water conflicts that plague India today. These conflicts, scale and nature, range over contending uses for water, issues of ensuring equity and allocation, water quality, problems of sand mining, dams and the displacement they bring in their wake, trans-border conflicts, problems associated with privatisation as well as the various micro-level conflicts currently raging across the country. Effective conflict resolution calls for a consensual, multi-stakeholder effort from the grassroots upwards.||Biksham Gujja,K. J. Joy,Suhas Paranjape,Vinod Goud,Shruti Vispute

The global growth of human population and production in terms of monetary flows (GDP) are complemented with data that demonstrate the ecological "embeddedness" of human economic activities. The article assembles data drawn from the literature and from unpublished work to draw a first, still sketchy, picture of major trends during the last 300 years. The analysis is based on three global regions, the industrial core, east Europe and the former Soviet Union and the developing countries. The analysis is based on the socio-economic metabolism concept, in particular material and energy flow accounting. The findings suggest that resource constraints as well as limits to the capacity of the biosphere to safely absorb emissions and waste will not permit a global transition towards the industrial society according to the pattern currently observable in the industrial core.||Helmut Haberi,Fridolin Krausmann,Simone Gingrich

To overcome this crisis, one should accept that there is nothing unethical in making extensive use of service taxes/user charges or delivering civic and other developmental services to the poor. One such area which has a high tax potential and tax buoyancy and remains untapped by many states is common property resources. This paper discusses the different dimensions of such resources in our panchayats, their utilisation status, their extent, the hurdles and roadblocks in exploiting them, management and environmental concerns from different stakeholders' viewpoints, and it lists observations and recommendations of a blueprint for the future.||Subroto Dhar

In recent decades, most governments around the world, bowing to sustained pressure from civil society organisations, have either legislated on or signed up to a broader universal convention promising access and transparency on environmental matters. These struggles have been varied, and in some instances, the laws enacted come couched with restrictive clauses; notwithstanding this, the struggle for assuring freedom of information has had the added benefit of raising awareness levels, even of those considered illiterate. For the future, as environmental deterioration threatens the very future of the world, what is required is global action that could facilitate the free flow of information across borders and nations.||Misha Singh,Shekhar Singh

Historical scholarship explains poor agricultural growth mainly in terms of adverse institutions, a hypothesis that fails to account for the much better growth rates in pre-war India. A contemporary discourse suggesting the presence of environmental constraints on investment in agriculture, and sustainability of extensive growth, supplies a better account of economic history. It can also connect the past with the present, when sustainability concerns have returned.||Tirthankar Roy

Through the study of the urban local body, a private agency and a civil society organisation engaged in this activity, the paper highlights issues related to effectiveness and equity, role of the urban poor in this service, and the relevance of an effective policy framework. In the context of increasing private sector participation in public service provision, and global awareness related to the impact of urban footprints on the planet, the study brings out some interesting lessons on the nature of public-private partnerships in SWM, and the role of the state in guaranteeing social and ecological equity and accountability. It also points to the urgent need for a change in the way the state itself approaches solid waste management, stressing policy mandates that will enforce equitable and ecologically sustainable waste management practices across the country. The study is based on qualitative research methodology, and involved in-depth interactions and discussions with residents, agency officials and conservancy workers, detailed examinations of secondary literature on SWM systems, and intensive field observation of SWM processes in the three agencies in Chennai.||Krithika Srinivasan

Case of Deteriorating Groundwater Irrigation in Tamil Nadu||Since in many states surface water sources have been utilised fully, there has been a massive expansion of groundwater irrigation. With the progressive decline in the water table, farmers have resorted to the competitive deepening of wells. This has resulted in increased costs of well irrigation and in a new inequity among the well-owners and between well-owning and non-well-owning farmers. Similarly, urban water demands have increased tremendously for domestic and industrial purposes. While there has been an ever-increasing demand for water, there has hardly been any effort to develop infrastructure to treat used water. This contributes to the pollution of the existing water stock. Therefore, water resources are under severe threat not only because of the ever-increasing demand and competing demand (from various sectors), but also because of the diminishing quality caused by discharge of untreated domestic sewage and industrial effluents. The main objective of this paper is to show how the degradation of the groundwater resource base through over-extraction and pollution contributes to inequity, conflicts, competition and, above all, to indebtedness and poverty.||S.

It lists the items and examines the structure of trade for select countries including India. The analysis shows that while there is no agreement on an acceptable definition of environmental goods, a number of submissions on the list of items that could be categorised as such have been proposed, with an emphasis on greater reduction commitments under the WTO agreements. It is observed that a number of environmental goods that are of export interest to developing countries like India have been left out and at the same time a large number of other items that are not strictly in the realm of environmentally preferable goods are included. Hence, a decision at the WTO would have to be suitably negotiated such that there is a consensus on the conceptual parameters for environmental goods while giving member countries the leverage to decide on the list of environmentally preferred commodities, as per their domestic requirement and export interests.||Archana S.
