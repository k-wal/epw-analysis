The gender bias is built into the discourse of tourism practices, images, and activities, which, by and large, privileges the male viewpoint. Researchers, academics and social activists have questioned the hegemonic male view of tourism at different levels, although their voices are still weak. In light of the fact that tourism processes are expanding rapidly in the globalising world, there is a need to strengthen these voices, both at the local and global levels. For a start, the agenda of women's movements everywhere must include the demand for greater participation of local people in tourism planning and development, especially if rights and interests of people in tourist destinations in the third world are to be protected. Only then can they share equitably in the benefits that result from tourism.||Indra Munshi

It also exposes the inability of political democracy, as we know it, to address weaknesses in law and governance. The state government meekly surrendered the opportunity that the struggle bestowed at the altar of the judiciary, rather than take advantage of it for bold political decision-making.

As this article suggests, the developmental state in Mumbai is intent on producing the modern world-class city through the construction of roads. However, this proposed development assumes that it will benefit everyone who lives in the city: a matter of public interest. Yet, the public who is being imagined thus as a putative beneficiary, is rather "exclusive". In Mumbai, the notion of public interest disconnects millions of people in the city from substantial citizenship particularly because of the privileged positions occupied by those who envision and operationalise Mumbai's projects of world-class development.||Nikhil Anand

This is a pilot study from a small area, so that results call for larger surveys to more reliably estimate water demand curves. Larger surveys would also enable us to examine additional issues like how efficient is water allocation in surface irrigation systems; do marginal water values vary much more between river basins than within river basins; if not, then the rationale for inter-basin transfers becomes less compelling.||E.

The anarchy of the Cultural Revolution put paid to all the symbols of that period. The general discrediting of communist and socialist discourse in China has also undermined its position on gender equality. The setting up of women's studies programmes and the pushing of a gender perspective within policy planning and within other disciplines is, therefore, a welcome and necessary step forward in that country.

This "demographic dividend" has improved the dependency ratio leading to the hypothesis that the bulge in working population will lead to an acceleration in growth. However, recent employment figures indicate that the absorption of the Indian youth into the labour force is not as high as one would expect. This is perhaps due to the poor employability of the workforce, which is severely affected by a deficit in educational attainment and health. This needs to be remedied in order to take advantage of the opportunity for growth that the demographic dividend is supposed to give India.||C. P. Chandrasekhar,Jayati Ghosh,Anamitra Roychowdhury

Although India's export success in IT is widely attributed to its human capital, it is not clear whether this has also been accompanied by industry-wide innovation. This paper explores the innovative behaviour of firms in the IT sector. Although substantial efforts have been made over the past 50 years by the government in implementing various policy measures, building institutions, and putting strong emphasis on higher education, there has been a systemic failure to promote the emergence of networks of innovation. This, in turn, has impeded the innovation performance of the IT industry. There is a need to direct policy to address this systemic failure and bring in industry-wide innovation.||Rey A. L.

While the state government initiated relief works on both occasions, the scale of the work was different in the two years. This paper examines the reasons for the difference in the state's response to the two droughts. Citing greater public pressure during the second drought year as the prime reason for a better response from the state, the article also explores the relationships that exist between different forms of public action and argues that if it had not been for the strong public action undertaken, the state government's response to the drought in 2002 would have been weak.||Reetika Khera

The comparison of production and consumption data (in terms of quantity and value) shows that the main causes of the discrepancies are the very high farm gate prices used for the valuation of fresh fruits and the overestimation of the quantum of fruits production. With revisions in prices and quantities, this paper re-estimates the total value of fruits production at the farm gate/ex-factory price as well as the share of processing in the production (processed and unprocessed) of fruits and vegetables. The quantity estimates turn out to be 46.6 per cent of the original estimates and the value of fruit production is 19.9 per cent of the original unrevised estimates.||Jatinder S. Bedi

The present essay looks at some of the older debates about the song and also about the novel "Anandamath" which frames the song. In the light of its novelistic context, the article argues, the song acquires different and darker meanings. Moreover, the verses that are not usually sung compose a vision of a militaristic patriotism that gradually replaces the more nurturing resonances of the earlier parts. The gradual movements of the song are replicated in the design of the novel. The article explores these shifts in the song and in the novel, while it simultaneously assesses the different readings of both - political and literary. It concludes with an attempt to seek out hidden subtexts in the novel which sometime disturb and deconstruct its dominant and obvious meanings.||Tanika Sarkar

On this basis, projections have been made on the future growth of the sector in the medium term, coterminous with the Eleventh Five-Year Plan. All-India level and state-wise analyses highlight the role of public investment/government expenditure on agriculture as being the crucial determinant in stepping up the rate of growth of agricultural production. Given other factors, a consistent increase in public investment to 15 per cent per annum should lead to agricultural growth of 4 per cent, which is concomitant with the projected growth rate in the Eleventh Plan. The other factors that are important for a higher agricultural growth are fertiliser usage and agricultural prices.||Archana S. Mathur,Surajit Das,Subhalakshmi Sircar

The two narratives tell the story of a school, built brick by brick and, together form a corpus that gives valuable insights into the making of colonial modernity in a small principality in the south of India. Much can be gained by looking at individuals of minor import, like Blandford and Taylor, whose writings provide valuable archival material for learning interventions in the field of religion in the project of Orientalism.

The trends show that there was a slowdown in the rate of growth of real daily wages of male and female agricultural labourers in more than half of the districts in the sample in the 1990s. Earlier, there was a striking rise in the growth of daily real earnings across all states between 1983 and 1987-88. Second, there was a rising trend in the variations in real wages across districts in the 1990s. Third, the differences between the average wages of male and female agricultural labourers have widened over the years. Fourth, the daily wages of male agricultural labourers exceeded the minimum wage levels in most states, while those of women were below the minimum in most states.||Pallavi Chavan,Rajshree Bedamatta

The Bank uses an arbitrary international poverty line unrelated to any clear conception of what poverty is. It employs a misleading and inaccurate measure of purchasing power "equivalence" that vitiates international and intertemporal comparisons of income poverty. It extrapolates incorrectly from limited data and thereby creates an appearance of precision that masks the high probable error of its estimates. The systematic distortion introduced by these three flaws is likely to lead to a large understatement of the extent of global income poverty and to an incorrect inference that it has declined. A new methodology of global poverty assessment is feasible and necessary.||Thomas Pogge,Sanjay G. Reddy

This essay engages with the nature of urban modernity in India while historicising the debates over the environment in Delhi. The issues and practices bundled together as "environmental", around which strategies and tactics are organised, shift through time. Infrastructure and public health; nuisance and noxious trades; pollution and zoning; standards and technoscience; and environmentalism through legal rights, leave their distinct imprints on how we dwell in the city. An environmental injury, perhaps, does not lie in Nature alone and must be apprehended through frameworks that render these injuries intelligible. The attention to these shifting registers shall help to link planning and environment both to power and to an anthropology of the urban modern in India.||Awadhendra Sharan

This paper looks at the conditions that allowed Salam to emigrate and develop a successful career in Europe as both a scientist and a scientific diplomat. The combination of colonial networks and academic policies in British India, on the one hand, and the post-colonial intellectual milieu in certain British scientific circles after 1948, on the other, provided Salam with an opportunity that would have been virtually unthinkable for the previous generation of Indian scientists. As a Pakistani theoretical physicist in Britain, Salam became one of the most authoritative and influential advocates of science for third world development. Yet, in post-colonial Britain, being from a former colony also put certain limits on Salam's aspirations. Salam's diplomatic and political career as a United Nations officer resulted from his conviction that supranational institutions represented the only chance to overcome the kind of discrimination that marginalised third world scientists in the post-imperial era.||Alexis De Greiff A.

This article looks at two girls schools in Ahmedabad, one sited in a Muslim locality and the other in a mixed dalit-Muslim populated neighbourhood, to study the impact of the events of 2002 on education. Fear and a history of violence have fostered antagonisms among different communities, while diminishing job opportunities and poverty imply that education opportunities, once available for girls, no longer exist. Denial of education, in turn, perpetuates illiteracy and trends towards an early marriage. The policies of a state government that sees communities as political votebanks have done little to restore amity between communities and faith in the state's "secular" credentials.||Suchitra Sheth,Nina Haeems

Fixing borrowing limits based on capacity to service debts and uniform targets for fiscal deficit reduction will further accentuate regional imbalances. Debt-stressed and backward states may find it difficult to raise loans from the market because of their lower creditworthiness and higher risk perception among lending agencies. The scheme of debt write-off linked to revenue deficit reduction recommended by the commission favours states with a low base year revenue deficit. A more realistic approach would be to allow a relatively longer timeframe for backward states to effect fiscal correction, while ensuring that states as a whole bring down their fiscal deficit to 3 per cent of GDP by 2009-10.||G.

A staggering 73.66 per cent (Panchmahaals) are found to be food insecure for more than six months in a year. The corresponding figure for Rajkot sample stands at approximately 19 per cent. This food insecurity is seen to be roughly consistent across poverty classification categories with similar distributions of food deprivation across both above poverty line and below poverty line households in our sample. Finally, the unavailability of food is found to be a seasonal phenomenon with unavailability peaking over the summer and monsoon and dropping off right before the winter months.||Sujoy Chakravarty,Sejal A.

There is evidence that it is the informal sector which bears a higher cost of borrowing as a result of positive discrimination in favour of corporates. There is also corroborative evidence that banks charge rates of interest far beyond their PLRs for rural households. All this is a clear case of market distortions and failure in achieving appropriate allocation of institutional credit. This can be corrected only by the application of the public interest theory of regulation in which calibrated central bank interventions can allow freedom to banks, but within an accepted industry discipline. The finance ministry's concern about the possible increases in the interest burden on the informal sector is to be appreciated in that light.||EPW Research Foundation

It has been argued that moving away from a cropping pattern oriented towards foodgrain production would enable land-poor farmers to sustain and improve their livelihoods. This paper examines issues related to high value diversification in agriculture by taking floriculture as a case study and finds that though the profitability of cut-flowers is substantially higher than that of the traditional crops, the participation of the smaller farmers in flower cultivation is lower compared to most of the other farm-size categories, primarily because of weak linkages with the market. The results indicate that risk aversion is an important impediment to crop-diversification, particularly for the land-poor category of farmers. Schemes to diversify crops are likely to face serious constraints unless resource-related and institutional barriers like access to markets are overcome.||Sucharita Sen,Saraswati Raju

To circumvent rigidities imposed by labour laws, the new form of employment that is being created in the economy is largely contractual. Based on a field survey, this paper looks at the status of contract labour in the state of Karnataka. The study finds that while a number of large firms pay wages above the minimum wage fixed by the state and support an increase in the minimum wage levels, a considerable number of small firms exploit the contract workers in various ways, including through non-payment of minimum wages. The study finds an urgent need to improve the social security network and supervisory mechanism for contract labour in the state.||Meenakshi Rajeev

It is argued that but for restrictive labour laws that create inflexibility in the labour market, the Indian economy would have experienced a higher growth of employment. On the other hand, this view is vehemently contested by trade unions and many other economists. This paper shows that the Indian labour market is quite flexible despite so-called restrictive labour laws. However, at the same time, Indian labour laws are so numerous, complex and even ambiguous that they promote litigation rather than the resolution of problems related to industrial relations. A comprehensive view on labour market reforms is required, one that addresses the needs of both employers and workers. The author recommends simplifying and rationalising the complex and ambiguous extant pieces of labour legislation into a simple code that allows for labour adjustment with adequate social and income security for the workers.||Alakh N.

It is found that firm size is a significant determinant of both these aspects of CEO compensation. The results also show that CEOs who are promoters of their firms earn significantly more than their ordinary counterparts. Such individuals also earn a much larger component of their compensation as incentive pay.

In this paper, the author refines the concept of "anti-incumbency" and then, based on this concept, measures the extent of anti-incumbency, in the ten Indian parliamentary general elections between 1967 and 1999 towards the historically most significant of political parties in India - the Indian National Congress. In addition, the paper examines the electoral performance of the INC in its marginal constituencies, both as an incumbent and as non-incumbent. Lastly, the paper examines the effectiveness of vote mobilisation by the INC in constituencies in which it was the incumbent and in constituencies in which it was not the incumbent. Based on all these approaches, there is little evidence of incumbency bias against the INC.||Vani Kant Borooah

But the growth had not been uniform and in line with the demand for such credit. Indebtedness has also increased in the state, but a large part of the debt has been for non-productive purposes. The incidence of suicides in Punjab has not been higher than the all India average and studies reveal that while indebtedness is indeed one of the major causes of suicides, it is neither the only cause nor the main one. There is thus no direct causal relationship between institutional credit, indebtedness and suicides in rural Punjab. The problems of indebtedness as well as suicides do not merit narrow interpretation or solution, as these are only symptoms of a larger malaise. They have to be contextualised in the light of stagnation of agriculture, rising levels of rural unemployment and dissipation of economic and social infrastructure.||P. Satish

In explaining the dismal failure and collapse of many imaginative development schemes, it is the role of state-driven development paradigms led by local elites and former landlords that needs to be squarely addressed. To explore the processes whereby systematic inequalities were perpetuated, this paper emphasises the case of village Shri Rampur in Gaya district of Bihar.||Arun Kumar

Awareness that the subject of autobiography, politicised as it is, also remains fully mediated by discourse has alerted feminists to ways in which discursive position and material or historical location are mutually implicated in autobiography. This essay focuses on the reception of autobiography and its politics by examining two autobiographies by Malayalee women and the controversies around them. The aim is to (i) understand these within the history of the discursive shaping of gender in Malayalee modernity, (ii) investigate the specific contexts of discussion that shaped reception of these texts, and (iii) examine political stakes in life-writing for female authors of autobiographies differently located.||J.

(ii) This can be mostly explained by their low higher secondary school completion rates. Thus, the primary distortions creating unequal representation in college lie at lower rungs of the education ladder. Attention to the quality of basic education, not college reservation, would therefore be the economically "first-best" response to the problem. (iii) Controlling for higher secondary completion, economic status is a better predictor of college attendance than social identity in urban India. Programmes to encourage equitable access to urban colleges could therefore consider targeting on the basis of economic status rather than identity. (iv) Compared to their 15 per cent and 7.5 per cent reservations, scheduled castes and tribes comprise only 10.2 per cent and 3.9 per cent of the college availing population. This draws attention to the implementation of existing reservations. Overall, these results emphasise the unequal representation of groups in college and urge policy-makers to seriously consider ways of making the basic education system better serve marginalised groups. They also highlight the importance of selecting policy instruments based on a clinical analysis of the data.||Rana Hasan,Aashish Mehta

Though the outreach and amount of agricultural credit have increased over the years, several weaknesses have crept in which have affected the viability and sustainability of these institutions. Following the shifts in consumption and dietary patterns from cereals to non-cereal products, a silent transformation is taking place in rural areas calling for diversification in agricultural production and value addition processes in order to protect employment and incomes of the rural population. In the changed scenario, strong and viable agricultural financial institutions are needed to cater to the requirements of finance for building the necessary institutional and marketing infrastructure. What is needed in agriculture now is a new mission mode akin to what was done in the 1970s with the green revolution. The difference now is that initiatives are needed in a disaggregated manner in many different segments of agriculture and agro-industry: horticulture, aquaculture, pisciculture, dairying, sericulture, poultry, vegetables, meat, food processing, other agro-processing and the like.||Rakesh Mohan

The accord emphasises the quantification of capital requirements on the basis of internal rating models. The internal credit rating models of banks are expected to produce the probability of default and loss given default to estimate the capital requirements of credit risk. This paper presents an analysis of the current status of internal credit rating practices of Indian banks. The survey reveals that the components of internal rating systems, their architecture, and operation differ substantially across banks. The range of grades and risks associated with each grade vary across banks analysed. This implies that lending decisions may vary across banks. There are differences among the rating systems of various banks. This paper presents a set of actions to improve the quality of internal rating models of Indian banks.||M. Jayadev

PD policies giving preferences to members of such disadvantaged communities are likely to have significant negative as well as positive consequences. Are there alternative policies - such as class-based preferences - that could deliver similar benefits without significant costs? After reviewing the diversity of ways in which a race-, caste- or ethnicity-based PD policy can be structured, it concludes that the case for deploying such PD policies is strong if the policies are carefully designed to maximise the benefits and minimise the costs.||Thomas E.

The general stability of a coastal system, including that of its socio-economic and biophysical environment, depends on the nature of human-mangrove relationships. But official conservation strategies very often intervene in the process by imposing restrictions on fishing and mangrove use. The present study analyses and quantifies the socio-economic impact of such restrictions on local economic activities and per capita income of a mangrove dependant coastal population on the east coast of India. Restrictions have led to instability of the local economy in the concerned villages, which may pose a risk of further denudation of forests, making the goal of a holistic management approach even further unrealisable.||Rajarshi Mitra,Rabindra N.

It explores the democratic political avenues used by those whose business opportunities and livelihoods were at risk, based largely on market participation and caste identity, to resist this legislation. The research is based on interviews and informal discussions conducted over an extensive period of time spent in the neighbourhood of the wholesale plastic recycling market in north-west Delhi and amongst the "elite establishment" - government officials, primary plastic industry members and others. As it appears, not only is caste identity thriving in the urban sphere, but this identity is actually being used in innovative ways to gain and maintain collective access to economic and political power.||Kaveri Gill

In the process it estimates how incomes are affected by characteristics such as gender, caste, language, etc. Using a maximum likelihood probability model, private returns to education are estimated; it emerges that greater levels of education increase both the likelihood of being employed as well as the income earned from work. However, the returns from elementary (primary and middle) education are quite low. Also, ceteris paribus, women, lower social groups, rural residents, non-English speakers have both significantly lower incomes and a lower likelihood of being employed. The results indicate that quality of education delivery and ensuring that the child remains in school should form important elements of education policy.||Laveesh Bhandari,Mridusmita Bordoloi

The corpse of the dead poet, Kazi Nazrul Islam, became the contested site by two sovereign nations.

This article, however, seeks to develop this concept further to describe a node of political discourse and practice in the freedom struggle. It traces the idea of service as propagated during various stages of the freedom struggle: Seva and how it was defined by the social reform movements of the 19th century; the Servants of India Society and their notion of seva; in Vivekananda's teachings; the early 20th century use of the term; as later enunciated by Gandhi in his early ideas of constructive work; the concept as it developed in interaction with Christian missionaries; the sevak's view of the tribal; Ambedkar's contestation of the term and his Constructive Programme and finally, the Nehruvian take on service. In each instance, the concept of seva was defined and sought to represent an interest group or community's position as the politics of the freedom struggle unfolded.||R. Srivatsan

However, recent studies have given conflicting results regarding the trend in wages. In this paper, we re-estimate rural wage rates from the three NSS rounds for 1983, 1993-94 and 1999-2000 for 15 major states. Our results show that the growth rate of manual casual agricultural wages declined during the post-reform period with some differences at the state level. In the case of manual casual non-agricultural wages, there was no decline in the growth rates at the all-India level. In the case of wages for all casual (manual and non-manual) wage labour, a decline was registered by both agricultural and non-agricultural wages in the 1990s. Analysis of the determinants of agricultural wages revealed that agricultural productivity, rural diversification, investment per hectare in agriculture, and percentage of agricultural labourers in the workforce were the key factors, with the impact of the latter two being lower in 1999-2000 compared to the earlier periods.||Ravi Srivastava,Richa Singh

The paper addresses the following questions to understand the dynamics of this causal connection, i e, is it telecommunication services that accelerates economic growth or overall economic growth that creates the demand for more telecommunication services for their growth to occur? In the context of developing economies, what are the factors that determine demand for and supply of telecom services? Finally, given the importance of telecom infrastructure in growth, what determines changes in telecom penetration in these economies? We present select quantitative and qualitative evidence from a few developing countries to understand the nature of the impact telecommunications has on their economy and society.||Kala Seetharam Sridhar,Varadharajan Sridhar

The focus on reduction in deficit numbers is counter-productive and needlessly ties the hands of the government. The ban on government borrowing from the RBI from April 2006 onwards, except for ways and means advances, is yet another new constraint on resources. There is therefore a need to rethink the government's fiscal reform strategy. Apart from more dynamic measures of resource mobilisation, the focus of attention should shift from the size of the gross fiscal deficit to the productive purposes for which deficits are incurred. Increasing social expenditures will also create some pressure on the revenue deficit of the government, which will have to be tolerated. Fiscal discipline and prudence are better achieved by concerted reforms on the administrative front, including effective decentralisation, rather than by controlling single measures like government deficits.||EPW Research Foundation

Against the backdrop of communities and identities being "imagined" into existence at the turn of the 20th century, the mythological, i e, Mahabharat, served as a media to re-treat and even reinvent old traditions.

But tenancy still exists. It is a consequence of the simultaneous increase in two categories of people, "those who have land but are unable to cultivate" and "those who have the labour and skills, but have no lands or not enough lands of their own to cultivate". This paper examines some micro level studies on tenancy in Kerala, more specifically, its prevalence across locations and crops, characteristics of lessors and lessees, the terms of lease and the income derived from lease cultivation. It argues for institutionalised arrangements for the expansion of lease cultivation, rather than sterner measures to check it. Among other factors, large-scale entry of self-help groups into the lease market to take up lease cultivation, often bringing hitherto fallow lands into production, prompts such a positioning.||K. N.

Despite these limitations, community-based conservation is here to stay. The real issue is not whether communities should be involved, but rather how such involvement can be made effective.

Some of the limitations of supply side financing are the inability to target the poor, lack of user choice, and the absence of linkages between provider payments and performance. Hence, there is a need to develop innovative financing mechanisms, which are able to target scarce resources at those who cannot afford to pay. One option is demand side financing. Demand side subsidies are not only better at targeting subsidies to the poor, but by linking subsidies with output, also provide the right incentives for efficiency. This paper discusses the concept of demand side financing and recommends piloting of a competitive voucher scheme as a mechanism for RCH services in India.||M. R. Bhatia,C. A. K. Yesudian,A.

However, the incipient or first phase of liberalisation began in 1974-75, and not in 1980, as a response to a crisis of enormous proportions in the economy. Treating 1980 as the year that marked the end of the "Hindu" rate of growth is an artefact of the unwarranted homogenisation of the entire history of economic growth prior to that year, and is misleading as to claims about economic liberalisation.||Baldev Raj Nayar

This paper discusses the extent to which these changes have been equitable, with a particular focus on equity across different landholding categories. The equity outcome in Hivre Bazar is better than in many other watershed programmes, mainly due to the use of watershed-plus and other attenuating measures. As such, it is a good example of how certain kinds of equity concerns can be taken up and implemented with local initiative. However, there are also limitations in the equity outcome, which raise important questions for future water interventions.||Priya Sangameswaran

05/8/2006-11/8/2006||special articles||4418536||Economic Growth and Employment in Labour-Surplus Economies||The idea that growth of the modern sector alone can improve employment conditions in labour-surplus developing economies has been and remains extremely influential. It is implicit in the argument that rapid economic growth is all that is required to improve employment conditions. It is also implicit in the fact that issues of growth of the modern sector are usually presented as issues of economic growth in general while issues of growth of the traditional sector hardly ever figure in debates and discussions. And yet, this paper argues, neither theory nor real world experience supports the idea. For employment conditions to improve, growth must occur simultaneously in both modern and traditional sectors. There are important issues of growth strategy for the traditional sector waiting to be debated.||Ajit K. Ghose

Though there is clear recognition of the incomplete process of rehabilitation, the report chooses to ignore the Supreme Court rulings on the issue as well as the assurance made by several state governments. Moreover, that the government chose to set up the committee even while it allowed construction to go ahead gives the lie to all its pious declarations of ensuring a judicious rehabilitation. On a wider level, the report symbolises once again the connections between "power" and "truth"; it is the project affected families that have been rendered marginal in shaping either the truth or the country's economic development.||Mike Levien

While witchcraft was based on the belief that evil spirits inflict disease, Ayurveda in India and Yin-Yang in China introduced the concept that the cause of disease is physical and not supernatural, which led to a search for physical remedies from plants, animals and soil. Homeopathy recognised that drugs assist the body to cure itself. Given the complexity of the biological system and disease processes, none of the medical disciplines can fully meet the expectations of the patient and therefore, have managed to survive until now. The dismal state of healthcare system in India, coupled with strong feudal culture, also caters to the survival of both rational and irrational medical disciplines and practices.||Daya R. Varma

02/9/2006-08/9/2006||special articles||4418648||Social Inequality, Labour Market Dynamics and Reservation||This paper brings two new elements to the debate around expanding reservation in centres of excellence in higher education. First, it separately estimates upper caste Hindu profiles in education (dropout and completion rates), employment and relative incomes and establishes that UCHs are significantly better off in all these parameters than scheduled tribes, scheduled castes and other backward classes. It also establishes that in urban India, ST, SC and OBC have very similar profiles and are at a great distance from the UCHs. In rural India, OBCs are situated in the middle - between ST and SCs on the one hand and UCHs on the other - but again at a significant distance from the latter. Second, it links this privileged positioning of UCHs with changing labour market dynamics in the 1990s and suggests that as a result these castes dominate access to the best jobs in the urban economy. Access to high quality tertiary education has then become key to accessing the most dynamic segment of a decelerating labour market. It uses evidence from both of these to intervene in the current debate around expanding reservations to OBCs in public institutions of higher learning and argues that the above make expanding reservation imperative.||Mritiunjoy Mohanty

However, militarisation and ethnic confrontation continue to define the parameters of public policy in India's north-east. Ethnic violence is accentuated by the existence of parallel political and administrative structures that undermine the rule of law. This article argues that the change in India's north-east is contingent upon the government's motivation to encourage transparency in governance and administration and to consciously move away from its existing reliance on archaic military solutions.||Sanjay Barbora

Most women's studies practitioners skirt the tricky issues of methodology and concept and march ahead bravely, meticulously documenting "women's oppression". The tragedy is that this empiricism does not equip us in developing our own theoretical foundations. If we want women's studies to be an interdisciplinary enterprise, we will have to see if it can be integrated as a specific epistemology to rebuild the existing structure of knowledge by creating new organising concepts, methodologies, skills and reciprocal assimilation of various disciplines.||Maithreyi Krishnaraj

The findings presented here are based on recent analyses of national data in a cross-section of developing countries. The data illustrate the multi-segmented structure of the labour force - both formal and informal - and the average earnings and poverty risk associated with working in the different segments. Special attention is paid to the differential location of the working poor, both women and men, in multi-segmented labour markets. The paper argues that there is a need to reorient economic policies to promote more and better employment in order to reduce poverty; improve national employment statistics to capture all forms of informal employment; rethink economic models of labour markets to incorporate self-employment and all forms of waged labour; and increase the representative voice of workers - especially informal workers, both women and men - in the processes and institutions that determine economic policies and formulate the "rules of the (economic) game".||Martha Chen,Joann Vanek,James Heintz

The random walk hypothesis for the Nifty and the Sensex stock indices is rejected. Both the stock markets have become relatively more inefficient in the recent periods, and have high and increasing volatility. Non-parametric tests also indicate that the distribution of the underlying variables are not normal and the deviation from normality has become higher in recent years. Both the indices show a negative autocorrelation at lag 2, indicating over-reaction one day after information arrival, followed by a correction on the next day. The study suggests immediate dissemination of information on foreign institutional investor trades and equity holding and the need to improve free float of equity to move towards efficiency.||Khan Masood Ahmad,Shahid Ashraf,Shahid Ahmed

The theme is situated in those critical moments of turbulences and upheavals within families, neighbourhoods and the political leadership that made individuals leave their homes. This article focuses on the "differing" means and modes of transport used by the Hindu and Sikh migrants from West Punjab (now Pakistan) to East Punjab during the Partition displacement. A variety of transport modes were used like foot columns, bullock carts, trucks, private cars, trains and aircraft - of which the fastest and the safest means were seldom available to underprivileged sections.

In contrast to the trend of divergence at the interstate level, the regional economies in Maharashtra are converging, though with significant differences in the rates of convergence across various sectors and regions.

It was during the last few years pending its demise that an "unleashing of the energy of history" produced a flood of new work in various genres, that fundamentally challenged received wisdom. The foci of this essay are, firstly, to depict the manner by which the Soviet regime controlled research institutions, publications and themes in the domain of history and, secondly, to chart the shifting positions concerning discussion of key events in Soviet history. The archive and the textbook have been singled out as exemplifying Soviet policies. The essay is interpretative and illustrative; it does not lay any claim to serving as an exhaustive chronicle of the histories of history in the USSR.||Arup Banerji

Sweeping the nation like a storm, the Latino protest mobilisation caught both the right and left off guard. The political struggle underlines the persistent economic gap between the US and its neighbours to the south, underlying racial stereotypes, fragmented ethnic consciousness, a divide between employers and right wing chauvinists, and the discontinuity between immigrant workers and the trade union establishment. Nevertheless, the May Day demonstrations could signal a new political awakening and rekindle the US labour movement.||Sharat G. Lin

The dominant response to the British presence came to be one that felt the pain of subjection, understood the fundamentally baneful character of the alien dispensation and paradoxically, hailed that dispensation as the harbinger of national regeneration. It produced a consciousness that recognised no incongruence between loyalism and nationalism. A similar ambivalence also manifested itself in issues like tradition, which came to be seen as "rotten" but also formed a "spring of renewal". This divided view of tradition was articulated in various forms that derived from and in turn hardened prevailing community identities.||Sudhir Chandra

Although the use of high-yielding varieties has brought huge gains in yield, variability is still a formidable production risk in a rain-fed environment. Estimates show that the intensity of drought is higher during the maximum tillering stage of rice production, emphasising the need for developing drought-resistant rice varieties. It is imperative that the varieties meant for a water limiting environment should ensure minimal level of yield during the stress period and this could induce the farmers to go for a higher level of adoption. Continued research on development of drought-tolerant rice varieties and seed supply management are crucial.||K. N. Selvaraj,C. Ramasamy

On an analysis of the NSS 55th round surveys for 1999-2000 we show that, on a range of economic criteria, there is a clear hierarchy across (essentially) caste-based social groups, with the scheduled castes (in urban India) and the scheduled tribes (in rural India) at the bottom, the OBCs in the middle, and the non-SC/ST "Others" at the top. However, for the poor among them, there is more of a continuum across caste-groups, with surprisingly small differences between the OBCs and the non-SC/ST Others. It is also shown that for the OBCs as a group, and especially for over 70 per cent of them who are above the poverty line, the extent of their under-representation in enrolments at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels is less than 5 per cent. Therefore, a 27 per cent quota for the OBCs, which would effectively raise their share in enrolments to over 50 per cent when their share in the eligible population is 30 per cent or less, is totally unjustified.||K.

This paper argues that the ecologically damaging resource use behaviour, which precedes environmental degradation, has to do with the user's access to natural resources. If access to natural resources is uneven, it can cause destructive use behaviour, motivated by surplus production and compelled by subsistence needs. Using the case of Pakistan, this paper shows that the size of holdings and tenurial status of farmers are two determinants of what has been termed "overshoot" of natural resource use. The deepening social divide in Pakistan, it appears, is worsening the "ecological divide", imperilling the country's economic growth in the near- and long-term. The paper makes an ecological argument that Pakistan can bridge the ecological divide by closing the social divide, which, in turn, requires it to widen the access of its land-short and landless farmers to farmland.||Tarique Niazi

It was a strategy that made possible a veiled criticism of the colonial state and the norms it imposed but was also an admission of self-mockery. This tradition of satire and self-mockery is carried further in novels that depict the disillusionment the citizen experienced in the post-colonial state, most evocative in Shrilal Shukla's novel of post-Nehruvian despair, Raag Darbari. The use of satire strikes a bitterly mocking tone, yet the humour assuages, lifts the narrative from being a work of utter desolation to one the reader can understand, mourn and yet laugh.||Ulka Anjaria

It argues that the repeated recessions and the enormous difficulties in economic recovery are not unrelated to the macroeconomic policies adopted by Japan. Countercyclical economic policies have largely been a let-down. Given the near liquidity trap situation in the economy and the doctrinaire methods of Japanese monetary authorities, not much could be expected from monetary policy. Expansionary fiscal policy could have provided the necessary demand push if only the fiscal stimulus had been large enough and the nature of public expenditure such as to induce a significantly high multiplier effect in the economy. This obviously was not the case. In the past few years, fiscal policy has been clearly contractionary despite the continuing demand deficit in the economy.||Sukanya Bose

There are genuine problems of observation, measurement and incentives behind this failure. In respect of public services, it is possible to substantially compensate for this failure by seeking "user feedback" on services. This paper presents the findings of a civil society initiative in Bangalore that produced "citizen report cards" on the city's services, based on user feedback and stimulated public agencies over a period of a decade to improve service outcomes. While citizen monitoring may be the only option when a government is indifferent to outcomes, there is no reason why the latter should not seek user feedback and benchmark its services when its internal monitoring is weak or incomplete. The citizen report cards of Bangalore offer a replicable approach that has now been tried out in other cities both in India and abroad, and even in rural areas. Whether the advocacy that follows the report card will improve service outcomes in all contexts is difficult to say as the responses from public agencies may vary. But even when a government and its agencies are indifferent, citizen report cards can be used to nudge them to pay more attention to service outcomes and public accountability.||Samuel Paul

However, UP's lower castes had, before the mobilisation began, and still have, the worst social indicators in the state and in the country. Earlier in the last century Tamil Nadu also experienced a mobilisation of the dalits and backwards, but managed to transform the social indicators in health, nutrition, fertility and education after independence. Thus, while UP's mobilisers of the dalits have focused exclusively on capturing power, the gains to the lowest castes have been entirely of a symbolic nature. This paper, after analysing the data from two National Family Health Surveys (1992 and 1999), addresses the reasons why UP's social indicators, including the health and education status of the lower castes, are much worse than in Tamil Nadu - despite the lower caste mobilisation over the last decade and a half.||Santosh Mehrotra

At the same time, it questions the received wisdom as to whether women's writing constitutes a separate category and if women do indeed experience, perceive and relate differently than men to the world they live in.||Jasbir Jain

The Reserve Bank of India, in consultation with the government, currently manages foreign exchange reserves. As the objectives of reserve management are liquidity and safety, attention is paid to the currency composition and duration of investment so that a significant proportion can be converted into cash at short notice. The government of India intended to use a part of its foreign exchange reserves to finance infrastructure. Infrastructure projects in India yield low or negative returns due to difficulties - political and economic - especially in adjusting the tariff structure, introducing labour reforms and upgrading technology. There is no evidence that any other country has used foreign exchange reserves to finance infrastructure. The amount of foreign exchange reserves in India is modest when compared to some of the other countries in the region and it can be argued that the proposed plan may lead to more economic difficulties than anticipated benefits.||Charan Singh

India's average growth rate over 2000-04 is identical to that of other emerging market and developing economies, though it is lower than that of developing Asia.

At this rate, India's present installed generation capacity of 123 GW would need to increase by 90-120 GW in the coming decade. This paper makes an assessment of the potential for capacity addition from various energy sources such as coal, natural gas, hydro, wind and biomass and concludes that these sources will be found wanting in closing the gap between desired growth and business as usual growth. In this background, the recent India-US declaration on cooperation in nuclear power provides an opportunity for accelerated growth. India stands to benefit from imported nuclear fuels and reactors to augment its indigenous capabilities. We critically examine the oft-stated criticisms regarding the economics of nuclear power and its role in  CO2 mitigation, and find these to be issues worthy of further analysis but not "deal-breakers". The recent US-India declaration should be viewed not with suspicion or alarm but rather as an opportunity for India to increase its power generation from nuclear sources and also as recognition for its outstanding nuclear non-proliferation practices. This agreement will also provide the much-needed breathing space the Indian atomic energy establishment needs for enabling the plutonium fast breeder and thorium reactors to come on stream.||Anshu Bharadwaj,Rahul Tongia,V.

Part II begins by examining the developments in environmental history that in the 1950s had their roots in the nexus that had developed in the 1930s between world history, the 'Annales' school of history and aspects of local history as well. Scholars of environmental history in this period also came under the towering influence of the historian Arnold Toynbee, whose narratives and explanations of the global cyclical movements in world history. Toynbee's later writings imparted a new ecological and internationalist direction to world history. The latter 1950s saw the spread of environmental history to scholars in other countries and an admixture of different disciplines and specialisations gave a new thrust to the subject. Earlier histories of imperialism and colonialism now began to be looked at a new from their impact on the environment and the ecology.||Richard Grove,Vinita Damodaran

Originating in the debates within the women's movements on structural inequalities in the family, where women's struggles had a certain centrality, it has become a legal/governmental category. Emblematic of most feminist initiatives about women's lives in our country, this shift is beset with its own dilemmas and impasses. While naming, categorising, enumerating and measuring violence as well as efforts to make them legally recognisable are imperative to any feminist politics, they also generate their own effects. These effects, while resulting in some well-needed institutional solutions, also bring in their wake, certain conceptual rigidities. There is a need to pay attention to these effects while rethinking the familiar demands in the arena of domestic violence: foolproof laws, sensitive institutions and better awareness among women.||A.

This is to be contrasted with the earlier policy which had resisted such pressures with a view to establishing an environment conducive to economic recovery. The current policy thus makes a determined effort to push up interest levels.

A common perception is that air quality policies were prescribed by the Supreme Court, and not by an institution with the mandate for making environmental policy. A careful review of the policy process in Delhi suggests otherwise. We find that the government was intimately involved in policy-making and that the main role of the Supreme Court was to force the government to implement previously announced policies. A good understanding of what happened is essential, as the Delhi experience for instituting change has become a model for other Indian cities as well as neighbouring countries.||Urvashi Narain,Ruth Greenspan Bell

This paper builds on the hypothesis that access to markets, defined in terms of demand for HVCs and the factors facilitating their transport from production sites to consumption centres, is critical to their growth. The analysis thus brings out regional variations in HVCs across the country that have implications for regional agricultural planning and consequently for public and private sector investment strategies.||P.

However, by the mid-19th century, as colonialism witnessed its own growing assertion and power, it was the anglicists, and their belief in the superiority of western knowledge, who came to play a more dominant role. This article analyses how the debate between orientalists and aglicists was played out in the sphere of science education. With the evangelical influence too coming to play a key role, this debate took on a more complex note. The colonial transnarrative now equated Christianity with western astronomy and Hinduism with puranic lore. Thus philosophy and pedagogy ably assisted the formulation of colonial education policy, that soon saw a neglect of traditional institutions and subjects.||Rajive Tiwari

It then asks the question as to why this project has been launched despite apparent weaknesses. The paper shows that IRLP is a culmination of the commercial approach to rivers that sees rivers as objects to be "conquered" and "consumed". The paper notes that time and experience have made this approach outmoded, and a new, ecological approach towards rivers has emerged. According to this approach, rivers should be appreciated for what they are, i e, as progenitor of various ecosystems and cultures. The ecological approach encourages harvesting river resources in a way that does not affect fundamentally the natural course and flow of rivers and the ecosystems and cultures they sustain. The paper notes that, in view of their strong tradition of reverence towards rivers, the people of south Asia can play a prominent role in championing the ecological approach.||Nazrul Islam

25/11/2006-01/12/2006||special articles||4418949||The Indian Monsoon, GDP and Agriculture||This paper attempts to assess the impact of the inter-annual variation of the all-India summer monsoon rainfall on the gross domestic product and foodgrain production by analysing the observed variation during 1951-2003. A substantial decrease in the annual rate of growth of grain production in the last decade (to a value of less than 1 per cent from the 2.7 per cent prevailing until the 1990s) suggests that self-sufficiency in foodgrains may not be sustained without changes in strategies. A significant finding is the observed asymmetry in the response to monsoon variation, with the magnitude of the impact of deficit rainfall on GDP and grain production being larger than the impact of surplus rainfall. We find that despite a substantial decrease in the contribution of agriculture to GDP over the five decades, the impact of severe droughts has remained between 2 and 5 per cent of GDP throughout. We have suggested that a possible reason for the relatively low response of grain production to average or above average monsoon rainfall post-1980 is that the strategies which would allow farmers to reap benefits of the rainfall in good monsoon years are not economically viable in the current milieu. The experience of the monsoon season of 2006 suggests that losses due to floods, caused in part by the sudden release of the water stored in the reservoirs of dams may be another important factor.||Sulochana Gadgil,Siddhartha Gadgil

Their rapid growth has had a significant impact on the world economy. After describing the two basic channels, namely, import demand and export supply, through which the growth of a country influences growth of the rest of the world and vice versa, the paper turns to its theme, namely, the influence of the growth of China and India. China is integrated to a greater extent than India with the world economy. Although India has succeeded in becoming a major destination of global outsourcing and in exports of information technology enabled services, it lags behind China in the competition to become a global manufacturing hub, though it is catching up. India's advantage over China lies in its vibrant democracy and the legal and financial systems. The paper concludes that whether or not India overtakes China in the next two decades, it is clear that both countries will be economic powerhouses in the medium term, and undoubtedly, their growth will have significant impacts on the world economy.||T.

The novel, widely praised for its "realism", combines an ironic, reflexive, seemingly "postmodern" narrative style with the analytical spirit of a work of social inquiry, unearthing causes that lie beneath superficial phenomena. The importance of such foundationally original works as Chha Mana derives not only from their intrinsic literary merit but even more from their pioneering innovativeness, which can be fully appreciated only in the evolving historical context of that literature. Fakir Mohan Senapati himself stands at the source of one of the two broad lines of development of the early Indian novel, the realistic-satirical, just as Bankim Chandra Chatterji stood at the head of the other line, the historical-romantic.||Satya P.

This paper examines the fiscal and distributional implication of ongoing and potential assessment reforms in two Indian cities, Bangalore and Pune. While our findings are specific to these two cases, the reform efforts and underlying problems are representative of most urban local governments. Reform efforts that bring assessment of the property tax base closer to market values have significant positive impacts on revenue generation and do not have adverse consequences in terms of the tax burden faced by the poor. While current assessment reforms are a good first step, structural issues such as improved valuation, increasing buoyancy of the tax, and building taxpayer confidence need to be addressed to make these reforms sustainable.||Somik V.

It argues that the current exclusionary logic, as manifested at Madhav, is flawed. Biodiversity is rapidly diminishing. Autocratic governance precipitates alienation among the lower strata of local people and contributes to illegal resource expropriation. Park policy ignores locally-embedded ability to protect biodiversity and willingness to be educated to that end. There is a pressing need for biological protection at Madhav but severe deprivation also exists in the area. Consequently, site-specific strategies are required that build not solely upon biology or economics but combine these concerns with sensitivity to the lower strata of people that live around the park and to the potential social, material and cultural costs of conservation policies.||Kim Beazley

Once the policy space started shrinking from the 1980s, the average growth rate of developing countries fell to half of what it was in the "bad old days" of import substitution. This shrinking space for developing countries is at the risk of shrinking even further, to the point of making the use of any meaningful policy for economic development impossible. This paper argues that in order to properly address the issue of policy space, we need to critically re-examine the principles that dominate international negotiations, especially in relation to trade and industrial policies. What pass in today's policy negotiations for the principles of a level playing field, special and differential treatment, less-than-full reciprocity, flexibility, and national autonomy are critically examined and their contradictions and limitations exposed.||Ha-Joon Chang

It also brings into view one of the oldest territories of British India - the Northern Circars.||Margret Frenz,Georg Berkemer

Bangalore Mysore Infrastructure Corridor||It appears that the courts did not look at the substantive issues behind the allegations that excess land was acquired for the Bangalore Mysore Infrastructure Corridor. The courts seem to have gone by the Karnataka government's assurance that only a minimum amount of land was given to the company. Bad governments need not act in public interest and may indeed abuse their "eminent domain" powers and aid and abet "eminent thievery".||V. Ranganathan

Also legislation should be enacted (for eviction of encroachers and punishing illegal water users), legal measures tightened and powers given to revenue authorities along with the local tank organisation to undertake maintenance and management of the tank system effectively.

The Maoists' goals - the building of a "mighty mass movement against imperialism", isolating and defeating the Hindutva-fascist forces, and building a "powerful urban movement, particularly of the working class" as complementary to armed agrarian struggle remain as elusive as ever. At a more theoretical level, the programme and strategic-tactical line of the CPI (Maoist) seem inadequate in coping with the complex Indian reality in a changed international situation, and in the context of the worldwide severe setback that socialism has suffered.||Tilak D.

The use of violence as a counterfoil to violence implies that the two sides are caught in the repetitive cycle of attack and reprisal; it also, in a more decisive sense, portends a shift in the paradigms followed thus far, of development and governance in a backward region.||Nandini Sundar

The attempt is to map the trajectory of successful handloom enterprises, locating them in the context of the growth of the handloom industry as a whole. The mapping seeks to highlight certain trends and processes that typify how handlooms work with markets and market institutions. In doing so, it also offers insights into understanding marketing practices within an artisanal mode of dispersed production.||Seemanthini Niranjana,Annapurna M.,B. Syamasundari,Latha Tummuru,Uzramma

It is a demand side analysis where the services sector output of a specific state is not only a function of the outputs of a state's own agriculture and industry but also the output of the commodity-producing sector of the rest of the Indian economy. The findings suggest that while a state's own industry turns out to be the most important determinant of services sector growth, the commodity-producing sector of the country outside the state does play a significant role as well in determining services sector performance under certain conditions that basically relate to the supply side.||Deepita Chakravarty

Global changes have not only questioned this dichotomy between domestic and international affairs but also raised concerns about the moral basis of politics at the international level. This paper argues that much of the confusion surrounding the analysis and justification of the need for global justice arises from the disparity between the wide usages of the term justice as it occurs in ordinary discourse related to humanitarianism and the way it has to do with the basis for making distribution of goods among citizens. It broadly proposes the need for reassessing concepts like state, democracy and sovereignty; to question membership-based sovereignty as the decisive determinant of democratic participation while working towards devolving decision-making to regional and local levels.||Vidhu Verma

Section 377 is not merely a law about anal sex alone, but applies to homosexuality in general. The lack of a consent-based distinction in the offence has made homosexual sex synonymous to rape and equated homosexuality with sexual perversity. Section 377 is the biggest affront to the dignity and humanity of a substantial minority of Indian citizens. The decriminalisation of sodomy will contribute directly to restoring the dignity of homosexuals and allow the gay movement to emerge from the shadows.||Alok Gupta

This paper critically analyses the modern versus alternative science debate. Postcolonial critiques of Eurocentric constructions of modern science and recent empirical studies provide the context for this study. It does not, however, provide a defence for alternative sciences, because even though their proponents critique modern science and its Eurocentric constructions, their studies, at one level, are over-determined by claims about modern science's unified, universalistic, and Eurocentric character. There is a surfeit of academic analyses of science as well as government policy documents on scientific research in India, but these provide little insight into how particular techno-scientific researches are conducted in India. This article, through a study of magnetic resonance imaging research in India and the US, based on interviews, observations, and analysis of scientific papers, argues that the relationship between scientific practice, knowledge, and culture is contingent upon particular historical and socio-technical contexts.||Amit Prasad

The only exception to this was Tamil Nadu where the schemes seemed to work the best in rural areas in the age group of seven to nine-year olds, without any discernible gender gap and was well targeted among the needy households. Further, among the poorer children, literacy rate and educational attainment were clearly higher when they had access to school meals perhaps implying that school enrolment and attendance improve in the presence of such schemes. This data however showed rather low coverage of Integrated Child Development Scheme among pre-school children across all states indicating problems of under-reporting or under-recording.||Brinda Viswanathan

For 200 years and more, the struggles waged by the oppressed and subordinated, i e, the subalterns, were seen as struggles for recognition as equals. The history of these efforts appeared as a history of sameness. However, in the later decades of the 20th century, this struggle was extended to encompass another demand - the demand for a recognition of difference - the existence of a variety of differences that explained the diversity, density and richness of human experience. It is this paradox that needs to be answered, while debating the construction of a subaltern citizen: how is the long-standing struggle for equality supposed to be folded into this newly asserted right to the recognition of difference?||Gyanendra Pandey

It questions recent work which has suggested that excess mortality in the years that followed the first Gulf war was only relatively modest in scale. An integrated account of child mortality trends is assembled. This indicates that mortality rose sharply in the early 1990s. It is likely that the United Nations Oil for Food Programme had a limited beneficial effect during 1998-2001, but this was lost in 2002 and 2003 with the build-up to war and the subsequent US/UK invasion.

The major traditionally discussed factors of conflict around international waters have been the riparian structure associated benefits and disadvantages, sovereignty notions, upstream-downstream diverging interests and regional power hierarchy. However, these factors are fairly stable for a long period of time in a given basin. These geopolitical or "space" centric explanations allocate too much emphasis on locations, thus draw unilinear and almost permanent conclusions.

The group's approach raise several important analytical and policy issues. The most crucial of these relate to effects of FII flows on (a) aggregate and sectoral investment; (b) behaviour of financial, including foreign currency, markets with special reference to their volatility; and (c) efficacy of fiscal and monetary instruments in attaining the objectives of macrostabilisation and growth. The article examines the macroeconomic impact of FII flows in the light of the Indian experience, and draws some policy conclusions regarding the role of such flows. It also addresses the issue of volatility in the Indian context. It finds there is no coherent macroeconomic model behind the expert groups' analysis and recommendations; no appraisal either of the optimal scale of capital inflows or the relative merit of FII vis-à-vis other categories of capital receipts at the current juncture of the economy; and no examination of monetary/fiscal problems associated with FII or of the quantitative impact of such flows on investment and other macro variables.||Mihir Rakshit

First, there is increased financial fragility, which the "irrational boom" in India's stock market epitomises. Second, there is a deflationary macroeconomic stance, which adversely affects public capital formation and the objectives of promoting employment and reducing poverty. Finally, there is a credit squeeze for the commodity producing sectors and a decline in credit delivery to rural India and small-scale industry. The belief that the financial deepening that results from liberalisation would in myriad ways neutralise these effects has not been realised.||C. P. Chandrasekhar,Parthapratim Pal

A relationship of complementarity exists between the problems internal to history and the demands and desires of memory, so much so that together they form integral parts of a single operation, the historiographical operation. Yet memory sometimes appears the obverse of history making. Human action, as this article remonstrates, sometimes overcomes the bounds of passivity imposed by memory and this is also what determines history.||Ranabir Samaddar

For nearly a century from the mid-19th to the mid-20th century, the discipline developed primarily in the from of "historical geography". A new phase of global environment history began with European decolonisation from the 1950s onwards. The imminence of a nuclear catastrophe and pesticide pollution stimulated the rise of a worldwide and populist environmental movement that reached full fruition in the 1970s. This article in two parts traces the beginnings and the shifting discourse of environmental history. Part I looks at the origins till the period of the 1930s. It was a time when the colonial encounter was becoming increasingly frayed, but environmental history benefited from the innovative convergence of writings on the part of geographers, archaeologists and ecologists, several of whom took an increasingly anxious and prescriptive view of human-environment interactions. Part II will appear next week.||Richard Grove,Vinita Damodaran

However, more receipts are unlikely to increase these benefits, while the downside is the potential volatility in exchange rates arising from the fact that participatory notes constitute a large component. We are unsure about the origins of funds that go into participatory notes and we do not know whether they are permanent in nature. It is possible to derive the benefits of FII investment without having to put up with the uncertainties created by PNs.

But when the postcolonial as a mode of analysis is linked to a fixed site of irreducible knowledge claims, it articulates an ontology that ties knowledge to location as a singular and essential quality of place. Location matters: by refusing to isolate the South from the West in the study of science, one leaves open the possibility of seeing multi-directional influences and channels simultaneously. Postcolonial science studies need a proliferation of historical and sociological accounts of science as practice in order to set a standard against which we can more easily identify "Indian Science" as a discourse that shapes a political struggle that has little to do with science studies, even if it has much to do with India.||Itty Abraham

Policy-makers are now seeking an escape route by getting the fiscal and revenue deficit targets relaxed. While there can be valid arguments against inflexible targets, abandoning the discipline underlying fiscal responsibility legislation, as has been suggested, is questionable.

The latest example is the curtailment of the refinancing capabilities of the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development. The time has come to reorient such an approach and ensure that NABARD operates as a non-commercial apex institution engaged in refinancing and promoting bank lending activities for the informal sector. For this, a number of steps have to be taken: restarting RBI contributions to the National Rural Credit (Long-term Operations) Fund, continuing the general line of credit limits, allowing market borrowings through priority sector bonds and providing tax exemption on NABARD profits.||EPW Research Foundation

In this context, this study made an attempt to assess the human-related constraints in management in the Peechi-Vazhani Wildlife Sanctuary, Kerala. It reveals that the constraints relate mainly to an insufficient attention paid to involving local communities and others who care about the protected area in planning, management and decision-making for the area, the social and economic dependencies of the local communities that conflict with the objectives of the PA.||V.

In Hind Swaraj, Gandhi etched out his ideas for an India freed of British control and also makes a critique of modern civilisation with his emphasis on the "proper". The book juxtaposes the connotations evoked by the prefix, 'swa', against that evoked by the image of the veshya, who is always at someone's control and whose agency is perforce without. The use of these words served Gandhi well in seeking to enunciate his own beliefs regarding violence and domination. He breaks from the modern tradition that sees domination as the taking away of power and agency, and reconceptualises resistance as the recovery of resistance. It also questions domination by insisting on a subaltern responsibility for subordination; not as a loss of power, but the loss of swa.||Ajay Skaria

Although the SSI is a part of the priority sector, its share in total priority sector advances of all scheduled commercial banks has been falling consistently from around 39 per cent in 1992 to around 24 per cent in 2004. This paper examines the trends in sectoral allocation of bank credit to the SSI vis-à-vis the non-SSI sector in the post-reform period. The paper also makes an attempt to understand the variations in bank credit to the SSI sector across bank groups, and also the influence of the size and performance of banks on credit to the SSI sector. The results indicate that the high incidence of bad loans arising out of SSI advances could be one of the reasons for the declining share of SSI loans of the commercial banks.||K. S.

The film's narrative poses the brahmin as the citizen ideal and the non-brahmin as its lawless all-pervasive "other". However, the film is in effect a statement about actually existing democracies wherein the brahmin and the citizen can exist only as never realisable ideals. The brahmin's individuality is overridden by his caste identity, which thus contradicts his claim to being a citizen. At the same time, for very many citizens, citizenship remains an unrealisable concept, for access to power and justice in a modern state, as the film demonstrates, relies very often on extra-legal means. The film thus raises several binaries that are opposed to each other, for instance those between a citizen and a non-citizen, caste and citizenship, democracy and mass participation, etc, failing in the end to resolve the contradictions it raises.||Rajan Krishnan,M.

Conflicts over borders and migration have characterised the relationships among the countries of eastern south Asia. The problems mainly stem from the introduction of the concept of a border by the British under the process of colonisation. The construction of borders was important not only in visualising an exclusive control of the ruler over particular geographical regions, but also in dividing people into "locals" and "migrants". In the 1990s, there were two discernible changes in the political and economic environment of eastern south Asia: India's policy shift to improve relationship with smaller neighbours, and the promotion of sub-regional cooperation. Nevertheless, migration and border disputes remain as thorny as before because sub-regional cooperation in eastern south Asia is characterised not by deconstruction of borders as political discourses, but by the absence of serious thinking about borders and borderlands, not to speak of the people who have to live with border realities.||Mayumi Murayama

What aggregate change is noticeable predates the liberalising reforms by a whole decade and industrial growth in the post-reform period did not pick up. Moreover, the problems posed by India's current pro-business model of development include disquieting implications for the quality of India's democracy. Why should the common people in a democracy accept a narrow ruling alliance at the helm? Is ethnic and nationalistic mobilisation a substitute for pro-poor politics? And, is India increasingly stuck with a two track democracy, in which common people are only needed at the time of elections, and then it is best that they all go home, forget politics, and let the "rational" elite quietly run a pro-business show?||Atul Kohli

While it is true that women were, in countless instances, Partition's ubiquitous victims, in very many ways the chaos and temporality of the post-Partition period allowed several of them to redefine themselves anew.

The widely embraced argument that this growth pick up is a result of the Indian state's adoption of a pro-market strategy is inadequate for three reasons: the growth pick up in India began a full decade prior to the liberalising reforms in 1991; post-1991 industrial growth has not accelerated; and uneven growth across Indian regions defies any simple market logic. Instead, India's economy has grown briskly because the Indian state has prioritised growth since about 1980, and slowly but surely embraced Indian capital as its main ruling ally. This pro-business growth strategy is likely to have adverse distributional and political consequences. The political economy argument for the growth in the 1980s is developed in Part I, and for the post-1991 period in Part II, which will be published next week.||Atul Kohli

Understanding the Disembowelment of India's Patent Regime||The recent amendment to the Patent Act, 1970 brings India into full compliance with its obligations under the Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement, in particular allowing for product patents in the area of pharmaceuticals and agri-chemicals. This amendment, the third to the 1970 Act, was characterised by a relatively muted rhetoric and a remarkable level of shared consensus amongst campaigners and critics. Focusing largely on domestic compulsions, as opposed to the global, the paper explores whether the shared consensus sets too narrow an agenda for patent reform. The paper suggests that the limits to implementing TRIPs are equally on account of ambivalence within the government with respect to intellectual property and the changing self-interest of sections of Indian pharma. Thus, despite a favourable international climate in the area of intellectual property (read Seattle, Doha and Cancun), patent reform in India has been doubly constrained by the narrow agenda and domestic factors.||Dwijen Rangnekar

But for decades, the violence of demolition was tempered by a policy of resettlement which, even when partially and imperfectly implemented, gave demolition a veneer of legitimacy. But the notion of housing for the urban poor has acquired an "illegality" in the last five years. The judiciary has been a significant contributor to this evolving jurisprudence on shelter, housing and the urban poor. The constitutionality that ensured every citizen the fundamental rights of livelihood, housing and shelter has now been revised, reinvented and supplanted by a legality that sees the urban poor as encroachers and a threat to civic existence.||Usha Ramanathan

In this paper we focus on the possibilities of the sub-national governments accessing, the financial markets in general and the debt market in particular. Our paper focuses on the need to create virtual entities - self-help groups amongst the urban local bodies - that could expand the domain of eligible ULBs. We visualise a scheme for capital market access by ULBs, which would work without the state acting as an intermediary and also without any new institution being set up. We provide the theoretical underpinnings, illustrate and operationalise the idea with the help of data related to ULBs in the state of Maharashtra.||Abhay Pethe,Mala Lalvani

Estimates suggest that in the non-farm sectors, as we move up the income ladder, the share of the informal sector gradually declines. However, as far as the agricultural sector is concerned, irrespective of economic class, the share of the unorganised workforce remains flat. Further analysis reveals that the coverage of social security schemes has been extremely sparse among the economically and socially vulnerable sections. The pro-rich, pro-capital policy of the present regime is reflected in the recent downward revision of the interest rate to the subscribers of provident fund. Further, the move towards defined contributory schemes away from defined benefit schemes of pension funds is fraught with danger. Therefore, we argue that given the poor affordability and lack of an institutional mechanism, any design of social security that relies heavily on a contributory basis is bound to fail dismally.||S.

However, due to the initial higher levels, agri-exports continue to be higher than agri-imports by one and a half times for 2003-04. The implications for agri-trade from the vantage point of foreign exchange have become quite limited, but the impact on domestic agriculture has been deepening. While over the years policy has focused relentlessly on non agri-exports, the share of India's agri-exports in world agri-exports is higher than the similar share of India's total exports in world total exports. When the top 15 agri-exports are considered, we do not see any discernible change in the composition, though commodities with a lower share show higher rates of growth. India seems to have avoided abrupt disruptions in its agri-trade patterns.||Dhanmanjiri Sathe,R. S. Deshpande

Two scenarios are tested: the continuation of the bilateral trade expansion between the two economies ("Chindia"), or the end of the catching up process and the emergence of a joint "India and China" upsurge at the world level. The latter hypothesis appears more probable considering the models of specialisation and industrial transformation followed by the two countries at both the micro and macroeconomic level. A quantitative assessment for 2015 shows China still largely ahead of India (services are not covered in the study) and a somewhat insignificant India-China bilateral flow at the world level.||Jean-Joseph Boillot,Mathieu Labbouz

Fitting Water Policy to National Development Context||Water scarcity has emerged, especially during the past decade, as an important theme in discussions on India's future. Global discourse suggests that India, and other developing countries in Asia and Africa, can respond to water scarcity - and the resultant water poverty facing their people - by embracing integrated water resources management, a package of best practices for improved management of water resources with strong emphasis on direct demand-side management. This paper addresses five questions about the IWRM paradigm with respect to India: (1) Is water poverty of countries caused by their water scarcity? (2) Would embracing IWRM help alleviate India's water poverty? (3) Is implementing IWRM feasible in India in today's context? (4) Has implementing IWRM helped counter water scarcity and poverty in other countries with a development context comparable to India's? And, finally, (5) What should be the priorities and roadmap for improving the working of the water sector in India? The paper reviews recent evidence from around the world to analyse these questions and concludes with a discussion of implications for water sector reform discussions in India.||Tushaar Shah,Barbara van Koppen

Reflecting on such internationalisation and donor involvement during this period and earlier decades, are two donor sponsored documents called the Strategic Conflict Assessments. Both documents offer the donors a critical perspective on their past and present methods of engagement with the political economy of Sri Lanka. Ultimately, the SCAs set out to convince the donors that the ethnic conflict is only one dimension of a larger "crisis of the state." As a central argument, the SCAs claim that the donors need to work politically to address issues of governance and the peace process. While there is a need to underscore the usefulness and uniqueness of the SCAs, which are rare self-critiques of the international community's engagement, there remain concerns about the framing of problems of neoliberalism, governance and conflict. Specifically, these are questions of how the SCAs conceptualise challenges to the internationally supported peace process, the political trajectory of the LTTE, and central causes of the conflict and flawed governance.||Cenan Pirani,Ahilan Kadirgamar

This study focuses on the observed inverse relation between poverty and unemployment, which holds both at the aggregate level as also at various cross-sections. The jobless growth of the 1990s, in general, and more so for agriculture, arguably contained the extent of underemployment and contributed to declining poverty. Continuing employment generation in the unorganised sector, albeit at a decelerated pace, coupled with increasing productivity also played a role. While there has been increasing casualisation of employment, the real wage rate increased sharply amongst casual labourers in rural India, possibly as an offshoot of public employment programmes and declining general prices for agricultural/rural labourers. Interstate remittances, as also those from abroad, could have also made possible the emergent configuration of declining poverty, increasing unemployment and decelerated growth at the state level.||Sanjay K.

The improvement in performance is also evident from (i) a rise in physical efficiency in electricity generation; (ii) a fall in public sector employment growth; and (iii) an increase in central public sector enterprises' profitability (even after excluding the petroleum sector). Yet public sector finances have remained adverse. Why? In electricity, passenger road transport and railways the revenue-cost ratio is less than one, and has declined since the early 1990s. Moreover, over the last 40 years, the public sector price deflator declined by 17 percentage points, relative to the GDP deflator. Hence, correct pricing and collecting user charges are probably key to setting public sector finances right.||R. Nagaraj

This is misleading, not only in analysing the past but also in contemplating the future. If we consider India during the 20th century as a whole, the turning point in economic growth was circa 1951. If we consider India since independence, the turning point in economic growth was circa 1980. And it is clear that the turning point in the early 1950s was much more significant than the structural break in the early 1980s. In the first phase of growth in post-independent India, from 1950 to 1980, India was not the lumbering elephant that it is often made out to be. In the second phase, from 1980 to 2005, India was not quite the running tiger that some believe it has become. The real failure, throughout the second half of the 20th century, was India's inability to transform its growth into development, which would have brought about an improvement in the living conditions of ordinary people.||Deepak Nayyar

Fourteen 'bastis' have been identified as being affected by groundwater pollution. However, no correlation appears to be established between the health conditions of the residents and water contamination, as various surveys and estimates are not conclusive and agencies are bickering over evidence. A health survey by a national agency of repute must be conducted to establish the basis for further action while the acute shortage of water itself is tackled.||Betwa Sharma

Though the expansion of the Indian stock market in the post-liberalisation period is truly impressive, in terms of quality there has been a regress. Trading has become increasingly concentrated in some sectors and companies, and the higher volatility in the market, without a corresponding higher return, portends greater risk and more instability for investors.||Joydeep Biswas

However, the reduction in capital expenditures, mainly in infrastructure, is growth constraining. This article argues that infrastructure expenditures have a propensity to increase inequality and this turns the attention of government towards redistribution, which, in turn, increases transfer payments and squeezes out capital expenditures. Sorting out governance issues associated with infrastructure spending is essential to making budgetary finances more growth-oriented.||Errol D'Souza

The estimates of cross-sectional growth regressions provide strong evidence of regional convergence in human development despite considerable divergence in real per capita income, indicating that the poor states that have failed to catch up with the rich ones in terms of per capita income have managed to catch up in terms of human development. The classification of the states based on their performance on HD and EG reveals that while only four states have been in the virtuous cycle category, as many as seven states have been in vicious cycle. The results suggest that the sequencing of policy should be such that the HD-induced growth process has to be strengthened for lifting the states from the vicious to virtuous cycle category.||Madhusudan Ghosh

Using an extensive battery of agree-disagree items, two major scales concerning ideological attitudes towards caste, on the one hand, and personal involvement with caste, on the other, are generated. After demonstrating that it is commonplace for these students to be opposed in principle but involved in practice, the paper relates the scales to independent measures of caste, class and religious background. The pattern of ambivalence and uncertainty revealed among these student respondents appear to reflect a pattern similar to what is perhaps emerging in the society at large.||N. J.

An analysis of the quarterly data for the period 1993 to 2003 shows that net capital inflows have been volatile, though not all components of aggregate inflows have moved in a similar fashion. The paper further analyses how capital inflows adjusted to changes in the real exchange rate and other macroeconomic variables in India since 1993. The econometric results indicate that an error-correction mechanism was operating between net inflows of capital and the real exchange rate. Macroeconomic fundamentals did not have any significant effect on the dynamic adjustment of capital inflows, and a co-integration relationship exists between the net inflows of capital, real exchange rate and interest rate differential. It is argued that co-movement in these variables was due to the intervention of the Reserve Bank of India in the foreign exchange market, which helped prevent the volatility of the real exchange rate in spite of the volatility in net inflows of capital.||Indrani Chakraborty

Even as younger women authors have succeeded in breaking earlier stereotypes and frameworks of depiction, the category of 'pennezhuthu' has come to be questioned as a defining term that limits, instead of enabling. Incisive feminist critiques of contemporary patriarchy now draw upon a variety of disciplines, with the result that long held notions defining Malayalee womanhood are being questioned with increasing regularity. Concomitantly, stereotyped frameworks and the pulls of the market continue to exercise a powerful influence. It makes it all the more necessary to foster independent initiatives in feminist knowledge generation in Kerala. "Women's Imprint", a women's publishing venture in Malayalam is involved in such efforts to help create new networks of resistance and towards ensuring that gender remains a contested category in public debate.||J.

In contrast, it is subsequently pointed out, the Maoists have taken the question of political power as fundamental to their project of revolutionary social transformation. The paper argues that the Maoists' stated ideological objective of smashing the present state order and developing a new proletarian state does not seem to be adequately confirmed by the flow of their current practice.

If this growth accelerates to 10 per cent a year, the region could see single-digit poverty rates by 2015. A closer look at the evidence suggests that much remains to be done to achieve these accelerated growth rates. First, economic growth in the past decade has resulted in growing income inequality, which may act as a constraint to higher growth. Second, while conflict and high fiscal deficits may not have constrained growth in the past, their persistence may become binding in the future. Third, a comparison with east Asia shows that south Asia's export-orientatio, inflows of foreign direct investment, workers' skill levels, infrastructure and ease of doing business are also substantially less advanced than east Asia's.||Shantayanan Devarajan,Ijaz Nabi

Swift action taken by the police initially, which unearthed a sinister plot, lost momentum in a few days and even local newspapers stopped reporting on the incident. A fact-finding report gave lie to the claim that the blast was due to the sudden bursting of firecrackers in the house. The rest of the state remained largely ignorant of the incident.

The number of engineering colleges has risen rapidly, particularly because of the growth of the IT industry, but the majority of their graduates cannot secure jobs in the top software companies, which dominate the industry in Chennai, mainly because they lack "communication skills". These skills are a form of social and cultural capital mostly possessed by the urban middle class, whose members believe that a key ingredient for success in a competitive economy and society is enhancing personal skills and knowledge through "exposure". Although abolishing caste-based reservations in private engineering colleges would have some effect on social mobility, it would not diminish middle class advantage. The reservations are only one factor in the equation, and are only marginally relevant to the real issues about social class mobility and the promotion of equally raised by the rapid growth of the IT industry in contemporary Tamil Nadu.||C.

In the rural constituency, a particular alignment of class forces is still driving the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe people, who constitute more than 40 per cent of the population and are principally agricultural labourers, to support the LF. In the urban constituency, where the LF has been alienated from the working class quite some years ago, its victory in the assembly elections was more dependent on the division of votes between the Trinamool Congress and the Congress.||Dayabati Roy,Partha Sarathi Banerjee

Pedagogy and Citizenship in Contemporary Society||Pedagogy has a crucial role in constructions of the self and the "good" or the "ideal" citizen. Civic education in schools seeks to build up notions of the good citizen, by outlining "ideal" norms of behaviour, for instance, towards parents, elders, the government, as also the nation. But the human subject is not always a passive recipient of pedagogic formulations. Rather as this article that bases itself on student responses in a test school in Delhi, establishes, students negotiate established pedagogy and received wisdom in a variety of ways. Their understanding of issues of citizenship is arrived at not merely through textbook instruction, but their reception to the very manner of this instruction that is exam-oriented, in their interactions with friends, peers and family as well as information received and interpreted through a variety of other sources. The article argues that to move beyond mere subjecthood and towards ensuring an individual's "agency" in the creation of "good" citizenship, pedagogy has to engage and debate widely with these varied sites of interaction.||Meenakshi Thapan

The 86th amendment to the Indian Constitution made free and compulsory education a fundamental right for all children in the age group 6-14 years. There are other direct and indirect costs that can deter children from going to school. In this paper, using a rich nationwide data set, the authors construct the incompressible direct costs of attending primary school in India. After controlling for the opportunity cost of going to school (as proxied by the ratio of children's wages to adult's wages), it is found that the direct costs of education adversely affect the probability of children going to school, more so for children from poorer households. The results show that relative to boys, girls are more likely to be affected by the direct costs of schooling. The authors show that making primary education completely free will not increase the attendance rates to 100 per cent. They find that the government will have to incur an additional minimum expenditure of over Rs 2,900 crore every year in order to defray the basic or incompressible cost of attending school.||S.

This almost unexceptional race-based harmony was attributed to the complementarity of business interests including an attempt to keep off native competition. It has been generally agreed that the larger interests of race took precedence over economic interests of individual members of the European business community in India. This paper presents data on a section of the European business community, that reveals behaviour contradictory to this general understanding. Based on an analysis of business behaviour of the European business community in Kanpur between 1900 and 1939 it is argued that the business conduct of the European commercial community in colonial India was primarily influenced by economic interests and not by any reasons of racial solidarity.||Manali Chakrabarti,Biswajit Chatterjee

Rural banks showed significant economies of scale in terms of assets and number of branches under each bank. Total factor productivity growth of rural banks was higher in profitability than in service provision during liberalisation. Banks located in economically developed as well as low banking density regions exhibited significantly higher productivity growth. Overall there is a convergence of efficiency of rural banks during the study period. Parent public sector banks have no influence on the efficiency and productivity growth of rural banks. There is a justification for opening new banks in low banking density regions as efficiency and productivity growth of rural banks in these areas are high. There is also a case for mergers and enlargement of the asset base and the number of branches under each rural bank.||A. Amarender Reddy

Urban poverty here is a spillover of rural poverty. But why do migrants not return to the rural areas if they continue to be engaged in low productivity activities? The reason could be that the informal sector offers them a better source of livelihood compared to rural avenues. This argument prompts us to pose a number of questions from an empirical standpoint. Based on primary surveys of slum dwellers in Delhi, the author examines if workers managed to experience a change in their occupation over time. Even when the broad occupation categories remain the same, does the nature of employment change and do income levels rise? If so, what role do networks play in helping them access better paying jobs. The findings tend to support upward mobility in a limited sense though.||Arup Mitra

The first women who tried to break the boundaries and appear on stage were those who came from communities seen as "marginal" or too "forward", for instance, the Anglo-Indians. Those who came from "respectable" communities, such as actors from established Parsi families, faced the threat of being ostracised. Acceptance by the audience and a female actor's ability and success in playing roles other than the merely conventional also belonged to those who could physically claim a distance from India and Indians, as seen in Nadia's success in the stunt movies. But as more and more women came to dominate the stage and later, even films, they had to pay the price for breaking the bonds of convention. Most of them faded away after a short screen life and were later berated for their inability to settle down as conventional "wives" and "mothers". This article traces the careers of some women, a few who came to dominate the stage, those who played memorable roles in the silent film and talkie era and others who distinguished themselves as singers, only to fade into oblivion a few years later.||Mrinal Pande

However, as the case study shows, computerisation is no panacea. There are operational problems arising from power breakdowns that lead to delays and the long distances farmers have to travel to obtain certificates result in very limited net savings to farmers.

It is expected to result in diversion of trade, rate wars and a race to the bottom in rates. Hence, total uniformity in rates among the states has been stressed. However, this has attracted criticism because full uniformity would curb rate autonomy of states. A suggested alternative has been a uniform floor rate system. However, this may be ineffective in eliminating rate differentials among states. An appropriate solution might involve rate autonomy for the states on commodities which are not prone to trade diversion and rate wars. In the case of others, states should apply uniform rates. Unfortunately, this has been hampered by the lack of empirical evidence on rate wars and a race to the bottom among the states. This paper makes a modest attempt to provide empirical evidence on these phenomena in the context of tax rate setting behaviour of the southern states under the previous sales tax regime. The conclusions of the study are useful to arrive at an appropriate VAT rate structure for the states.||R. Sthanumoorthy

Using a simple theoretical model, it is shown that the revised accord will result in asymmetric differences in the efficacy of monetary policy in influencing bank lending. This will, however, depend on a number of factors, including whether banks are constrained by the risk-based capital standards, the credit quality of bank assets and the relative liquidity of banks' balance sheets. The basic model is empirically explored using data on Indian commercial banks for the period 1996-2004. The analysis indicates that the effect of a contractionary monetary policy will be significantly mitigated provided the proportion of unconstrained to constrained banks in the system is significantly high.||D.

The reaction to this "disenchantment" with this superior yet hollow rationality appears to be a return to "older, primordial" emotions and values.

The subsequent evictions and forced relocations have destroyed people's lives by removing them from their areas of work, cutting off their social networks and destroying the housing and infrastructure they had built with their life's savings. It is ironic that the courts have not held government bodies accountable for their failure to provide affordable and adequate housing for the poor, even as they have chastised them for slum creation, instead of slum clearance.||Kalyani Menon-Sen

The first and mainstream view takes globalisation as the rational outcome of global economic "progress". A second and dissenting view gives more emphasis to the power and ownership aspects of the globalisation process. This paper argues that the present globalisation process embraces elements of both views and is essentially monopoly capitalism, advancing on a world scale that seeks to integrate peripheral economies into a single global system. As a peripheral economy Bangladesh has become more marketised, more globalised, and more urbanised; and in the process it has now a large number of super-rich and an increasing number of uprooted poor people. This paper makes an attempt to understand the integration process of Bangladesh with the global economy.||Anu Muhammad

In Punjab, this policy is found to ignore equity considerations while granting non-discriminatory electricity subsidies to the agricultural sector. This study highlights the existence of disparities in the flow of electricity subsidy between the advanced and backward regions. While the medium and large farmers reap the major benefits of the subsidy, the poor small farmers, especially in the backward areas, remain excluded due to their non-possession of electricity connections. In a nutshell, this paper questions the justification for introducing such a policy and puts forward the case for user charges based on open access to electricity.||Varinder Jain

An increasing share of the Indian GDP today however originates from a "third" service sector. The presence of a large service segment necessitates a switch from the two-sector to at least three-sector framework of terms of trade analysis. This paper estimates the terms of trade effect for these three domestic sectors across India and in 15 major state economies. The results confirm the crucial role played by services in determining the terms of inter-sectoral trade.||Surajit Deb

The Sindhi-speaking Hindus and Muslims, who hitherto drew their sense of identity from territory, language and sufi masters (worshipped commonly by both communities) began to move towards polarised religious identities. The success of the Muslim League and RSS from 1941 onwards concretised the polarisation (which was neither complete nor uniform). This article builds upon the memories of some Sindhi Hindus who attended RSS shakhas in their teens and early youth and brought with them distinct memories to divided India, a phenomenon undocumented but with considerable implications for the contemporary politics of India.||Rita Kothari

By detailing the dynamics of electoral and party politics in the context of a constituency which suffers from a "development deficit", the study examines the place of political leaders, party strategy, political ideology, political rhetoric, youth participation, voter loyalty, identity mobilisation, etc, in the democratic process. To engage with these issues of democracy-in-practice the study has chosen to look in detail at the case of political nomadism (defections) in the constituency and to see how both, the political institutions set up to regulate it and the political calculus of parties, have responded to such behaviour. By using an ethnographic approach and an attitudinal survey, the study raises questions related to representation, institutional regulation, and the tension between act and rule utilitarianism in a working democracy for the public discourse in India.||Peter Ronald deSouza,Sushma Pawar,Solano Da Silva,Edzia Carvalho

With the expansion of capitalism and trade, it was largely the bourgeoisie and merchant capitalists who championed secularism, though minorities continued to live in a segregated fashion in European states that remained, in essence, theocratic. While secularism as a notion denoting the separation of religion and state was accepted by the early Congress moderates in India, this idea of secularism, however, underwent a change with the impact of colonial policies, and the response of different sections of Indians to colonial rule. In colonial India, identity based on religion, as with other identities, became essential markers to secure privileges in a government that was ostensibly based on liberal political ideas derived from the west. In post-independent India, this has led to secularism acquiring a changed meaning: the idea that all religions shall be treated equal.||Himanshu Roy

An Empirical Analysis||Though cotton has been cultivated predominantly in many parts of India, its productivity is one of the lowest in the world mainly due to attacks by pests/insects and low coverage of irrigation facility. Despite using pesticides, farmers are unable to control the bollworm, the key pest in cotton, that ravages up to 80 per cent of crop output. Bt cotton introduced in March 2002 for commercial cultivation in India is considered an important variety in protecting the crop from bollworm attack. However, not many credible studies are available focusing on the economic aspects of Bt cotton cultivation using properly designed sample survey data. In this paper, using data collected from 150 sample farmers from two districts in Maharashtra, an attempt has been made to study the economics of Bt cotton cultivation. This study provides an in-depth analysis of the impact of Bt cotton on pesticide use, costs of cultivation, productivity and profit.||A. Narayanamoorthy,S. S. Kalamkar

Of these, the folk and classical streams cannot effectively discriminate empirically valid knowledge from beliefs, and have grown slowly. Science is notably an organised enterprise of scepticism, anchoring itself firmly on the bedrock of empirical facts, thereby ensuring that deliberate manipulation of information is quickly exposed and eliminated. Official knowledge, though claiming to be science based, permits itself to be manipulated by vested interests, by discouraging scrutiny. As a result, much of the information base for managing India's environment is incomplete, outdated, or downright bogus. The only way to correct this is to expose it to public scrutiny. The new Right to Information Act makes this possible. The tools of information and communication technology can facilitate such scrutiny by making available all relevant information, in full detail, on a publicly accessible website. Together, these developments present a tremendous opportunity to replace the current bureaucratic "control and command" by a "share and inform" approach.||Madhav Gadgil

The onset of recession in 1997 had an apparent immediate effect on non-SSI sickness, but its effects on the small sector were visible only after a two-year lag, indicating perhaps the greater resilience of SSIs.||Rosemary K.

By using varied discourses and competing points of view and an almost omniscient ironic narrator, Senapati brings to notice human subjects who are otherwise on the margins of privilege. However, these different strands of discourse, while appearing sutured, are also incompatible politically. There is realistic fiction in the way Senapati portrays human nature; at the same time, his depictions of extremes in temperament belong to the realm of folk melodrama. Thus, hierarchical structures of domination, such as those in the village, are much to blame for human suffering, yet the use of folk melodrama by Senapati would appear to locate this suffering in a demonically evil person, i e, a witch. Senapati's truest vision emerges where these twin currents appear to intermingle, when he uses language and irony to play off logic against hearsay, science against superstition and learned discourse against plain speech.||Paul L.

The new Scheduled Tribes (Recognition of Forest Rights) Bill needs to be contextualised in the ground reality of conflicting interests and claims. First, the category of scheduled tribes is contested in social science discourse. Second, forest and tribal policy in India is not adequately sensitive to value systems of local communities and this creates considerable contestation between administration and the local people. This paper revisits these contestations in the worldwide body of academic discourse. There has been fair consensus in the literature that value systems and customary institutions of local communities have well-developed mechanisms that regulate sustainable lifeways and conserve local ecosystems, though unquestioning acceptance of these may also lead to errors. What is required is for policy to effectively deliver benefits to people and conserve biological diversity, and it is anthropologists who can mediate a dialogic space between the people, their civil society institutions, networks of advocacy, public and local intellectuals, the academia, policy and governance.||Arnab Sen,Esther Lalhrietpui

The impact of economic reforms on the productivity levels of an industry at the aggregate and sub-sectors level do vary significantly. While the net impact of the reform process on total factor productivity growth was found to be poor at the aggregate level, the sub-sectors - drugs and pharmaceuticals and paints and varnishes, basic chemicals and dyes and dye stuff industries - greatly benefited from the liberalisation process. Within the sub-sectors, the worst affected was the fertiliser industry as the TFPG declined significantly in the post-reform period. In the same way, the productivity differentials are found at the firm level as well. While small firms experienced a fall in productivity levels during the post-reform period, the large firms could raise productivity. The differences in the productivity levels of small and large firms and among the sub-sectors within an industry reveal the heterogeneity of the industry.||T. Sampath Kumar

The study also compares the tax effort and taxable capacity of the state governments with the average tax effort of all the states in India. Various determinants of tax bases have been selected to estimate the average rate and taxable effort as well as the taxable capacity of the states. The results indicate that during the period 2000 to 2003 Gujarat ranked first in this regard, with West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh in the second and third places respectively.||Mahesh C. Purohit

The central issue in this battle is not the invoking of the past, but precisely how the past is brought into discussions about the present. Related to this basic inquiry is the subsidiary question: does the acknowledgement of the continuing relevance of the past imply that "the distant past must guide how one acts in the present"? The recognition of the relevance of the past must be distinguished from the case for being guided by the past in a choice-independent way. It is important to recognise that the significance of the past for us today involves selection and choice in which our contemporary concerns can have a reasonable role. It is also important to see that this connection between the present and our involvement with the past neither undermines the need to look for veracity and ascertained evidence nor removes the case for deliberately concentrating on those cases in which the lessons involved have particular relevance to our concerns today. The problem of selections from the past involves, in this sense, both epistemology and practical reason.||Amartya Sen

The global growth of human population and production in terms of monetary flows (GDP) are complemented with data that demonstrate the ecological "embeddedness" of human economic activities. The article assembles data drawn from the literature and from unpublished work to draw a first, still sketchy, picture of major trends during the last 300 years. The analysis is based on three global regions, the industrial core, east Europe and the former Soviet Union and the developing countries. The analysis is based on the socio-economic metabolism concept, in particular material and energy flow accounting. The findings suggest that resource constraints as well as limits to the capacity of the biosphere to safely absorb emissions and waste will not permit a global transition towards the industrial society according to the pattern currently observable in the industrial core.||Helmut Haberi,Fridolin Krausmann,Simone Gingrich

State real per capita income, with elasticity less than one, is found to significantly enhance educational expenditure at the aggregate, elementary, secondary and higher levels. Moreover, contrary to general perceptions, education expenditure at all levels has been significantly lower after liberalisation vis-à-vis the pre-economic reform era. This is particularly detrimental for the vulnerable sections of the population, i e, for females and backward social groups. It is evident that even after controlling for the economic reform process, privatisation exerts a negative significant impact on expenditure on higher education.||Anindita Chakrabarti,Rama Joglekar

The paper also analyses the sectoral shares of employed females, the annual average rate of growth of employment for urban women and the employment patterns.

Is it a governance issue, as the union finance ministry makes it out to be, or is it something more fundamental affecting the fiscal powers of state governments? We argue that the constraint on expenditure is imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility and Budgetary Management Acts passed by the centre and most state governments; the cash surplus phenomenon is a perverse outcome of such legislation. This essay also investigates the price paid by Kerala, an outlier where receipts do not keep pace with expenditure growth, because of the mechanical constraints imposed by the fiscal responsibility legislation.||T.

When textbooks are the major, if not sole, purveyor of knowledge, the schools' choice of textbooks plays a significant role in the understanding that students have of their history and how current religious tensions could be interpreted. This study analyses four major events in Indian history and how they are presented in textbooks used by three faith-based schools that represent Christianity, Hinduism and Islam. By and large, the textbooks do not indulge in "revisionist history". However, a subtle interpretation of history is implied by the language used and by omissions and commissions of details. Further, these relate directly to the history of the religion and to the role religion played in Indian history.||Jessica Levknecht,Hema Ramanathan

In addition to the private sector and state delegates, accredited civil society organisations were for the first time invited to the table to participate in debates over financing ICT for development, ensuring cultural diversity, the future of intellectual property rights and debating the merits of a new system of internet governance. This article critically examines the role of civil society in proposing a "humanitarian agenda" that contests the dominant neoliberal mode of governance within the WSIS process. Specifically, the article considers why narrow claims for recognition - expressed in the right to freedom of information - eclipsed more expansive claims for both recognition and redistribution in terms of access to ICT infrastructure and content. It draws from feminist insights into the normative dimensions of global social justice after more than two decades of theory and praxis around transnational activism and the challenges of deliberation through difference.||Paula Chakravartty

In recent decades, most governments around the world, bowing to sustained pressure from civil society organisations, have either legislated on or signed up to a broader universal convention promising access and transparency on environmental matters. These struggles have been varied, and in some instances, the laws enacted come couched with restrictive clauses; notwithstanding this, the struggle for assuring freedom of information has had the added benefit of raising awareness levels, even of those considered illiterate.

04/3/2006-10/3/2006||special articles||4417909||A Model of Exports and Investment in an Open Developing Economy||The paper develops a model that privileges exports as the key element of demand; not only do exports permit the exploitation of scale economies by enlarging the size of the market served by domestic producers but also lead to the effective use of the relatively abundant factor, i e, labour. The development literature has further emphasised the fact that exports are instrumental in inducing investment because of the incentive they provide to introduce new techniques through additions to the capital stock. The model introduces somewhat different export and investment equations in an otherwise traditional Keynesian model. Exports lead to investment and investment, in turn, leads to higher capacity utilisation and further investment, which stimulates growth. However, the commodity composition of a developing economy's exports implies that exports are a function of the real exchange rate. An increase in the real exchange rate (depreciation), while stimulating exports and thus growth, however, leads to an erosion of the real wage share because of a price rise through imports. The steady state can be interpreted as a balance of these two forces - an exchange rate depreciation leads to growth through an increase in exports but simultaneously causes a cutback in government expenditure to maintain a floor wage share, impeding the growth process.||Rajiv Jha

What should a women's studies programme connote and what obtains in practice? Through a survey, this paper attempts to map the different aspects of the women's studies programme in institutions of higher education of Tamil Nadu. The contention of the paper is that the forms and conditions of the institutionalisation of women's studies in places of higher education to a large extent constrained the possibilities of carrying out research in this area as an academic discipline. The paper has important implications for bodies such as the University Grants Commission that, at one level, have been in the forefront of the institutionalisation of the women's studies movement in India, particularly in the 1990s, but, at another level, have failed to achieve the kinds of intellectual and political changes promised by the founders of this discipline in India.||Anandhi S.,Padmini Swaminathan

Some British Impressions of Indian Academic Employment Relations||This article surveys recent development in Indian employment relations, broadly defined, from the perspective of a visiting British academic. The author finds traditional academic industrial relations, centred on trade unions and collective bargaining, in decline as globalisation, the new economy and the expansion of business schools and disciplines reshape the study of Indian work and employment. The article discusses the emergence of human resource management as a potentially managerial and individualist alternative to critical, labour-sympathetic intellectual traditions. The author discerns hope for the future in the strong Indian traditions of labour history and labour economics, while stressing the need for a strong critical, empirical sociology of work that can establish what the new Indian workplace(s) are really like.||Peter Ackers

Historical scholarship explains poor agricultural growth mainly in terms of adverse institutions, a hypothesis that fails to account for the much better growth rates in pre-war India. A contemporary discourse suggesting the presence of environmental constraints on investment in agriculture, and sustainability of extensive growth, supplies a better account of economic history. It can also connect the past with the present, when sustainability concerns have returned.||Tirthankar Roy

Through the study of the urban local body, a private agency and a civil society organisation engaged in this activity, the paper highlights issues related to effectiveness and equity, role of the urban poor in this service, and the relevance of an effective policy framework. In the context of increasing private sector participation in public service provision, and global awareness related to the impact of urban footprints on the planet, the study brings out some interesting lessons on the nature of public-private partnerships in SWM, and the role of the state in guaranteeing social and ecological equity and accountability. It also points to the urgent need for a change in the way the state itself approaches solid waste management, stressing policy mandates that will enforce equitable and ecologically sustainable waste management practices across the country. The study is based on qualitative research methodology, and involved in-depth interactions and discussions with residents, agency officials and conservancy workers, detailed examinations of secondary literature on SWM systems, and intensive field observation of SWM processes in the three agencies in Chennai.||Krithika Srinivasan

It finds that although the ICDS programme appears to be well-designed and well-placed to address the multidimensional causes of malnutrition in India, there are several mismatches between the programme's design and its actual implementation that prevent it from reaching its potential. These include an increasing emphasis on the provision of supplementary feeding and preschool education to children aged four to six years, at the expense of other programme components that are crucial for combating persistent undernutrition; a failure to effectively reach children under three; and, ineffective targeting of the poorest states and those with the highest levels of undernutrition which tend to have the lowest levels of programme funding and coverage. In addition, ICDS faces substantial operational challenges.||Michele Gragnolati,Caryn Bredenkamp,Monica Das Gupta,Yi-Kyoung Lee,Meera Shekar

Following the fiscal correction path releases resources for the revenue plan through falling interest payments and increases capital expenditure by allowing the permissible fiscal deficit to be fully used for that purpose. It gives the required balance in resources available for the revenue plan and capital plan. The profiles of saving and investment make a growth rate of 8.5 to 9 per cent achievable within the plan period. These would be possible by adhering to the fiscal responsibility targets and not by compromising on them.||D. K. Srivastava

The most plausible explanation is that, after the prolonged rise in prices, foreign investors judged that the market was overvalued and decided to book profits. They might have been pushed towards doing so by the rise in interest rates in industrial economies and the expectation that the rate rise has not run its course. The troubling aspect though is that India's share of portfolio equity flows has been fuelled substantially by participatory notes. Also, the composition of total equity flows of private capital in India is at variance with that of developing countries.||T. T. Ram Mohan

Representing the Stakes of IT Globalisation||The growth of the Indian IT sector is widely seen in the US as the result of the "export" of "American" jobs. Ignoring the context of changes within India, American media represent the Indian IT boom as the effect of problems within American political, economic and educational structures. This paper examines how India and Indian IT are represented in relation to America's position within the global economy. On the one hand, IT outsourcing to India is seen as a "natural" result of free market capitalism, but, on the other, it is an "unnatural" disturbance in the balance of power between the US and the rest of the world. I argue that this ambivalence can be better understood by examining how freedom, mobility and autonomy are powerfully articulated in constructions of American national identity. Indian IT workers are threatening not just because they are "taking" American jobs, but because "the American dream" seems to have migrated to India as well. The retreat into economic nationalism and calls to strengthen territorial boundaries suggest the inability - or refusal - to imagine mobility in relation to American national identity in terms other than that of unhindered movement into temporal and spatial frontiers.||Mobina Hashmi

Supply shocks, both due to a setback in agricultural production and international oil prices, and monetary expansion due to automatic monetisation of the fiscal deficit were the major contributory factors to higher inflation. Reform initiatives since the early 1990s towards developing a broad-based financial market, particularly activation of the government securities and forex markets coupled with improved monetary-fiscal interface enabled better monetary management since the second half of the 1990s. Moreover, judicious supply management through buffer stocks of foodgrains and import of sensitive commodities containing the adverse impact of supply shocks also played an important role. It can also be noted that notwithstanding the unprecedented size of external capital flows, monetary management was effective in ensuring a reduction in inflation and lowering expectations.||R. K.

This paper undertakes an empirical study of the perceptions and views of the policy-makers, programme implementers and disqualified elected representatives in four of these states. Some have argued that adoption of the two-child norm by elected panchayat members would have a "demonstration" effect on the community. However, evidence suggests that even at the village level, caste, class and gender politics dominate and those who belong to the backward communities offer no role model to members of higher castes or their own kith and kin. The two-child norm impinges on basic human rights, is anti-women and anti-weaker segments.||Leela Visaria,Akash Acharya,Francis Raj

What stands out in the coverage is the very rapid expansion in trade with Hong Kong and China, with the latter turning out to be the largest source of India's imports. The most illuminating revelation is that through the divergent interventions and non-interventions, the Reserve Bank of India has succeeded in pursuing an exchange rate policy that has sustained the effective rate "around the benchmark" - truly a commendable feat despite having to shock the market occasionally with sharp interventions to curb the speculative proclivities of some dealers.||EPW Research Foundation

About half of all Indian children are undernourished, more than half suffer from anaemia, and a similar proportion escape "full immunisation". There is therefore an urgent need to re-examine what India is doing for the survival, well-being and rights of children under the age of six years. Ultimately, this involves addressing the structural roots of child deprivation. However, there is also an immediate need to protect this age group by integrating it in an effective system of child development services that leaves no child behind. In this context, this paper, along with the collection of articles published in this issue, examines the role of the Integrated Child Development Services programme in protecting the rights of children under six.||Jean Drèze

In an emerging economy like India where volatility is large, emergence of universal banks can contribute to faster economic growth as it assists in strengthening the alliance between companies and banks. A movement into universality is likely to promote consolidation in a healthy manner and hence should be encouraged.||A. K. Khandelwal

The suicide mortality rate for farmers in the state has increased from 15 in 1995 to 57 in 2004. The rain-dependent cotton growing farmers of Vidarbha are faced with declining profitability because of dumping in the global market by the US, low import tariffs, failure of the Monopoly Cotton Procurement Scheme and withdrawal of the state (resulting in declining public investment in agriculture, poor government agriculture extension services and the diminishing role of formal credit institutions). The farmer now depends on the input dealer for advice, leading to supplier-induced demand, and on informal sources of credit, which result in a greater interest burden. In short, the farmer is faced with yield, price, credit, income and weather uncertainties. The way out is to merge bold public policy initiatives with civil society engagement.||Srijit Mishra

Following the short-lived dotcom boom in India (2000-02), Information Technology Enabled Services-Business Process Outsourcing was first considered by many infotech industry watchers as a capricious venture, liable to crash due to poor infrastructure.

Microfinance may be classified as primary and secondary. Whereas the primary microfinance service includes savings, credit, insurance and money transfer, the secondary service includes enterprise credit, pension, equity transaction, leasing, etc. The paper then argues that competition with compassion and right to earn profit under the lens of a rational regulatory and supervisory framework and government's active participation in capital formation, both human and physical, are the major forces necessary to fuel the healthy, sustainable and useful growth of microfinance institutions. The paper finally proposes a layout of the MF network, defining the roles of different entities, viz, government, central bank, microfinance authority, banking partner, rating agency, deposit insurance agency, promoter, capital provider, human capital building institution and, finally, MF clients.||R.

Volatility is analysed using the combined data set of the Economic Times Index and the S&P CNX Nifty together. The return series observes volatility clustering where tranquil periods of small returns are interspersed with volatility periods of large returns. The GARCH (1, 1) model is estimated and the result reports evidence of time varying volatility. The TARCH (1, 1) model is also used to test the asymmetric volatility effect and the result suggests an asymmetry in volatility. The conditional volatility for the combined return series shows a clear evidence of volatility shifting over the period. Although the high price movement started in response to strong economic fundamentals, the real cause for abrupt movement appears to be the imperfection of the market.||Madhusudan Karmakar

But these high interest rates soon created massive domestic financial fragility in the banking sector and in state government finances, leading to an increase in public debt through continuous private banking and state government rescue activities. And this public debt exploded due to high interest rates, which became systematically higher than both the growth in public revenues and the returns on reserves. In the meantime, the real economy imploded because of these rates, but high interest rates became even more necessary as a (poor) substitute for missing public sector reforms and as a price for political stalemate. It then did not take much (the Russian devaluation and default in August 1998 and a relatively minor internal political crisis at the beginning of January 1999) for Brazil to end up in a major financial crisis.||Gabriel Palma

Moreover, with regard to its relatively small market size and in some respects, the federal structure of its constitution, Canada bears some resemblance with India. Competition policy in small market economies is a relevant subject for study simply because most developing countries suffer from the small size of their domestic markets. Small market size and the existence of economies of scale result in a situation where a market for industrial goods can support only a few technically efficient firms. This results in concentrated markets with relatively higher concentration ratios than that is observed in large economies like the US. In small economies the potential scope for anti-competitive practices is likely to be higher.||K. V. Ramaswamy

But the WSIS was never mandated with a clearly defined global "problem". The summit was held at a time when US-led interests were active in undermining several democratic forums of global governance, even as global capital appeared increasingly intolerant towards public policy regimes. Thus there was a consistent attempt to keep several substantive issues out of the summit discussions. Moreover, the private sector, as a supposed leader of the information society, was pushed in very questionable ways into various governance arrangements.||Parminder Jeet Singh,Anita Gurumurthy

Each country, given the historical evolution of its healthcare system, adopts different strategies to achieve these goals. The financing of healthcare through public and/or private channels is one important component of this strategy, as it has a significant bearing on the way healthcare is delivered and also has implications for the health policy goals of equity, efficiency and sustainability. Understanding what determines these expenditures is important from the viewpoint of health policy. This paper examines the relationship between income and public and private healthcare expenditures.||Ramesh Bhat,Nishant Jain

Case of Deteriorating Groundwater Irrigation in Tamil Nadu||Since in many states surface water sources have been utilised fully, there has been a massive expansion of groundwater irrigation. With the progressive decline in the water table, farmers have resorted to the competitive deepening of wells. This has resulted in increased costs of well irrigation and in a new inequity among the well-owners and between well-owning and non-well-owning farmers. Similarly, urban water demands have increased tremendously for domestic and industrial purposes. While there has been an ever-increasing demand for water, there has hardly been any effort to develop infrastructure to treat used water. This contributes to the pollution of the existing water stock. Therefore, water resources are under severe threat not only because of the ever-increasing demand and competing demand (from various sectors), but also because of the diminishing quality caused by discharge of untreated domestic sewage and industrial effluents. The main objective of this paper is to show how the degradation of the groundwater resource base through over-extraction and pollution contributes to inequity, conflicts, competition and, above all, to indebtedness and poverty.||S.

The earlier limits on Centrally Sponsored Schemes no longer exist and state Plan assistance has also assumed a non-block character with the proliferation of additional central assistance schemes. The centre has also introduced purely discretionary schemes. Another major change has been witnessed in the form of central schemes bypassing state budgets and directing funds to state agencies and local bodies.

It lists the items and examines the structure of trade for select countries including India. The analysis shows that while there is no agreement on an acceptable definition of environmental goods, a number of submissions on the list of items that could be categorised as such have been proposed, with an emphasis on greater reduction commitments under the WTO agreements. It is observed that a number of environmental goods that are of export interest to developing countries like India have been left out and at the same time a large number of other items that are not strictly in the realm of environmentally preferable goods are included. Hence, a decision at the WTO would have to be suitably negotiated such that there is a consensus on the conceptual parameters for environmental goods while giving member countries the leverage to decide on the list of environmentally preferred commodities, as per their domestic requirement and export interests.||Archana S.

This paper attempts to provide such a base, with buoyancies estimated over a 23-year span starting in 1980-81. If estimated over a sufficiently long period of time, the buoyancy coefficient essentially estimates the underlying revenue-generating properties of the system with endogenised tax policy. A log linear trend fit over the entire period showed serial correlation, which is eliminated for all but one state, Assam, with the introduction of structural breaks. A third specification, including the log of the per cent share of industry in the domestic product, eliminates serial correlation for Assam, and improves the goodness-of-fit for some other states. In all but six states, the sign of the change in the buoyancy coefficient at the break is positive. Where the buoyancy-enhancing break occurs in the late 1990s, the spurt in tax effort might have been an endogenous response to the expenditure shock from implementation of the higher salary scales recommended by the Fifth Pay Commission.||Indira Rajaraman,Rajan Goyal,Jeevan Kumar Khundrakpam

Subsequently, an incipient software industry with recognisably high export potential has been targeted via fiscal incentives and the provision of export-enabling infrastructure.
