22/4/1967- ||special articles||4357840||China: End of Act One?||Recently in some analyses of the latest developments in China's Cultural Revolution an attempt has been made to show that Mao Tse-tung is after all retreating. The so-called "three-way alliance" between the revolutionary rebels, the People's Liberation Army and the Party cadres is, it is suggested, really a face-saving device. A close examination of recent writings in the "Red Flag", the Party's theoretical journal, however indicates, according to the author, that this view is incorrect. The tone and mood of the writings make it clear that Mao Tse-tung is in no mood to compromise. Nor does it seem possible that he would be forced to compromise.||G. P. Deshpande

20/5/1967- ||special articles||4357963||Indian Foreign Policy, 1947-64||Indian foreign policy, the author argues, has been marked by a complete lack of ideological thinking and, in fact, has been very pragmatic. It would be a great pity therefore, he feels, if bewitched by the mechanistic models of the so-called realists, our foreign policy were to shelve its internationalist value assumptions. The first part of this article, which appeared last week, discussed the model on which India's foreign policy was based in the Nehru era and examined the strategy and tactics which this model entailed. In this, the second and concluding part, the author examines the criticisms of our foreign policy related to the issues of military alliances, non-alignment, and national security.||Deepak Lal
1/2/1967- ||focus on development||4357570||Water Management: A Neglected Aspect of Indian Agriculture||No programme of agricultural development by way of modernisation or use of new high-yielding seeds or large inputs of fertilisers can succeed without adequate supply of water and without proper water management for agricultural purposes. This must be accompanied by an appropriate ayacut development programme which is properly the responsibility of the agricultural department in the States. To get the maximum contribution from irrigation to agricultural production, we need co-ordination between the Irrigation, Rural Electrification, Co-operation and Agricultural Departments. We also need the co-operation of industry for producing supplies of agricultural inputs and of the district administration for co-ordinated action at the local levels. The agricultural scientist has also to be involved in the whole process not only for extension work, but also for evaluation, guidance and research, oriented to the needs of the climate, crops and cultivating practices of the region. Above all ways and means must be found to make the cultivator a partner and participant in both major and minor irrigation. All these are complicated problems and they need detailed study and solution on the national, State and local levels. The author, therefore, suggests the appointment of an irrigation commission that will deal with both major and minor irrigation works, review progress, evaluate performance, identify gaps and mistakes and suggest concrete policies and detailed programmes for full and scientific utilisation of the country's water resources with the accent on water management by the cultivator for the maximisation of agricultural production. Such a commission should essentially be manned by agricultural scientists and progressive agriculturists rather than merely by engineers and irrigation experts.||V. K. R. Rao

No development Plan — and the Fourth Plan is no exception to this — can be cut down proportionately or in any other manner without seriously jeopardising its consistency and its ability to attain the desired objectives. On an analysis of the resource-structure of the Indian economy it is clear that the main constraint on resources is the decision-making and implementing machinery that we have. Unquestionably, we have to choose between improving this machinery and economic stagnation or decline.||Sudhin Kumar Mukhopadhyay

III: Claims and Counter-Claims||In this, the third part of this study, the author examines the nature of the host of claims and counter-claims which the Congress has to face in the selection of candidates. The claims may be personal, regional, socio-economic and organisational. Fortunately for the Congress, the large number of conflicting claims are aggregated into factions so that the problem of arriving at a consensus becomes one of finding bases of agreement between factions. However, when the contending factions are more or less evenly matched, the normal procedure for resolution of conflicts breaks down. Recourse has to be had in such situations to informal, extra-organisational methods to arrive at compromises so that all the factions can be retained within the party.||Ramashray Roy

An attempt is made here to ascertain the relationship between changes in excise duties on different commodities and changes in their prices.

In certain cases, the conflict of interests is illusory; simple economic criteria, applied in a comprehensive manner, are adequate to resolve the conflict. The periodic struggle for sugarcane between sugar mills on the one hand and gur and khandsari producers on the other hand-which is being witnessed in the current sugar season too-is avoidable if a rational and dynamic view is taken of the whole problem.||B.

II: Pressures and Counter-Pressures||In the first part of this article, which appeared last week, the author discussed the formal criteria and procedures adopted by the Congress for selecting the candidates. In this, the second part, he examines the actual working of the procedural arrangements and discusses the considerations that really swayed the local level party activists in making their recommendations. The local level activists are swayed to a very large extent by conditions prevailing in the particular constituencies. Their concern with local conditions leads them to prefer candidates who in their opinion can effectively carry the constituency or district for the Congress. To the extent local leaders are swayed by such considerations, they are strongly impelled to violate or bypass the formal criteria laid down by the top leadership.||Ramashray Roy

The question has been asked by students of Chinese affairs. Has it been asked in China too? There is no evidence to suggest that there has been any serious difference of opinion in the Chinese Communist Party over China's compelling need, in view of the hostility of the United States and the Soviet Union, to have a nuclear deterrent. But differences appear to have arisen over the pace of China's race to nuclear capability. In February 1965 Edgar Snow reported Mao Tse-tung as having told him that it would be enough for China to make a few bombs for scientific experiment. Since then, however, Mao seems to have accepted the military demand for a well-equipped nuclear arsenal. What is the nuclear weapons programme costing the Chinese economy?||C. S.

1/8/1967- ||new beginnings in planning||24477862||Incomes Policy in Developing Countries||If an internally consistent and balanced plan is formulated and implemented, is there any need for an incomes policy in a developing economy like India? There are two reasons, it is argued here, why a well-formulated incomes policy is necessary if the objectives of the development plan are to be realised in a mixed economy. First, an incomes policy ensures that the pattern of money income generated is consistent with the plan, and second, it further ensures that the objective of reducing consumption disparity is attained. Indeed, the need for an incomes policy is much more urgent in a planned developing country. Also, an incomes policy for a developing country has to be evolved in a wider perspective and would require for its implementation guidelines and instruments different in character from those in a developed country. This paper attempts to elucidate the role of incomes policy in a planned process of development, to discuss the question of guidelines for an incomes policy, and to suggest the major policy instruments and machinery required for operating an incomes policy.||V V Bhatt

Growth of average consumption has not been stabilised; imports have not been minimised; marketed surplus has not been socialised; and the poorer sections of the population have not been provided their minimum requirements. If the objectives of Government operations in foodgrains had been clearly defined and the extent of the operations quantitatively determined, much progress would have been made by now towards their realisation. Per capita consumption, instead of being allowed to fluctuate widely from year to year with fluctuations in output, could have been stabilised at a reasonable level. Instead of talking endlessly of self-sufficiency and actually importing 64 million tonnes of foodgrains over the period, a steadily growing consumption could have been sustained with half that quantity of imports. Instead of promising to nationalise the entire marketed surplus and in fact obtaining only 8 per cent of it, the Government could have gradually come to acquire a little more than half of it. Instead of trying to introduce universal rationing on a widespread scale and keeping it always on the brink of collapse, the Government could have deliberately decided to supply foodgrains to the most deserving one-quarter of the population through its distribution network. Finally, instead of making frequent announcements of the intention to have a buffer stock without ever having one, the Government could have built an adequate reserve with small additional imports earmarked for the purpose. Unless there is a dramatic increase in the long run growth rate of foodgrains production, the execution of a coherent government programme to achieve the four objectives of steady growth of consumption, fair price distribution, socialisation of the marketed surplus and self-sufficiency will be necessary — and possible. An average consumption of 15.8 ounces per capita can be sustained and low income families assured of their needs with strictly limited imports of not more than 7 million tonnes in the next four years.||Raj Krishna

1/2/1967- ||focus on development||4357553||Perspectives on External Assistance||Economic development of the underdeveloped countries is not merely an economic process; it is an integral part of a wider social process of nation building. Further, this process of nation building is interrelated with the process of evolving an international community. International development assistance should be viewed as an instrument to facilitate and accelerate the pace of both these processes in a peaceful, stable and democratic environment. External assistance policies, therefore, should be framed and implemented within this broad perspective. The developing countries are likely to need international assistance for the next 30 to 40 years. For assistance to be effective in enabling them to generate a viable development process it should be assured for a long enough period so that it can be effectively integrated with their development strategies. The terms and conditions of assistance should be fixed keeping in view the objective of generating self-sustained growth in the developing countries. The United Nations Development Programme can play a vital role in evolving the appropriate machinery for assisting the developing countries not only in formulating plans and strategies but also in formulating projects and in evaluation, technical research and manpower planning. Such assistance by the United Nations would ensure the soundness of plans and projects. Development assistance policies can then be evolved on the basis of objective criteria and the developed countries would have adequate assurance of proper utilisation of assistance. The ultimate viability of the growth process in the developing countries depends on the success of these countries in increasing their industrial exports. Their efforts in this direction would be facilitated if the developing countries assist them by (a) carrying out mutually advantageous structural transformation in their own economies; (b) giving preferential treatment to imports of industrial goods from the developing countries; (c) linking interest and amortisation receipts on their external assistance to trade in industrial goods among the developing countries; and, (d) permitting the developing countries to use aid for purchases from other developing countries.||V.

Too much attention has been focussed on nitrogenous fertilisers whereas the real problem facing us is the shortage of sulphur which threatens to hamstring the production of phosphorous. For, if fertilisers are to have the maximum impact on agricultural yields, they have to be administered in a complex, granular, water-soluble form incorporating nitrogen, phosphorous and potash. So even if we establish the planned capacity for nitrogen, the fertiliser programme will fail unless we give urgent thought to reducing our dependence on imported sulphur. The most practical way of doing this would be to turn to the production of phosphoric acid from rock phosphate by the electro-thermal process. This is a well-known process and is in use in many countries. Why then, have we not thought of trying it in India?||A. Gupta

In India the status and conditions of national integration are visible in the connection or disjunction between decisions in the Lok Sabha on the one hand and relations of MPs with their constituents on the other". In this article the author examines the role of the Members of Parliament belonging to the ruling party and the opposition in establishing channels of communication between their constituents and decision-makers, in articulating needs of the former and influencing the policies of the latter. Nation-building, the author argues, is not some special activity that the Members of Parliament undertake. It is rather by performing their customary functions-of representing their constituents' interests and influencing policy and administrative decisions-that they contribute significantly to the nation-building process. The author examines the extent to which these processes have crystallised in India, the forms they take, and the problems they pose. The article is based on the author's first-hand study of MPs carried out in Delhi during 1963-64.||Henry C. Hart

They operate in a society in which business has not been honoured by tradition. So, while the scope for initiative and the salaries have attracted talent into industry and while professionalism in management is on the increase, the Indian manager is still in search of a style. This is a critical juncture in the history of professional management in India because the styles set today will determine the quality and fate of industry tomorrow. The manager has first to believe in his cause and in the particular contribution he can make to his country's development. But such belief will have to be sustained by distinct professionalism. He will have to comprehend and use the tools of business management which make business today far less hunch-based than before. But even the efficient manager will not convince or be emulated unless he has his roots in society. If the Indian manager sets himself up in an atmosphere distinctly alien to the average Indian, he may earn distant admiration but will fail to convey his full message.||Arabinda Ray

However, for action in particular areas and especially in the different States it may be more useful to have a number of disaggregated analyses. A national educational policy, such as the one that the Union Minister of Education is trying to evolve, should take the form either of a general declaration on national ideals and intents or, better, of a co-ordination of a large number of State and regional educational policies emerging from divergent economic and social conditions as well as political and ideological preferences. The comments made in this article on some of the major proposals discussed by the MPs' Committee on Education are, therefore, subject to many regional and local variations.||Sureshachandra Shukla

Our attitude to the question of overseas Chinese in this area can be an important factor in our relations with the governments of the countries which have large Chinese populations. More important, the overseas Chinese can be an important source of contact with China. The Chinese Government may be peculiarly impervious to what goes on in the world, but it keeps in close touch with the overseas Chinese. The overseas Chinese in turn know a little of goings in China beyond what appears on wall posters in Peking. Overseas Chinese live in countries where a certain amount of freedom of association and expression are allowed. It should be possible, therefore, to establish contact with them. In doing so we would be establishing contact, though at one remove, with mainland China.||Sankar N. Maitra

The first is a problem of education, while the second is essentially a political problem. It looks as if the second aspect of the problem is assuming greater importance. Most of the controversies on the language issue for the last twenty years or so have centred on the need for a link language in the context of national integration. As an educationist, I am naturally more interested in the choice of medium of instruction and examination. I shall, therefore, confine myself primarily to this aspect of the problem, even though I feel that in the process of the solution of this problem one can, if one is rational, find a clue to the solution of the other problem, too.||A K Dasgupta

In many cases anthropologists now seem to be in danger of being torn apart by the conflicts between the first and the third set of loyalties. On the one hand, part of the non-western world is in revolt, especially against the American government as the strongest and the most counter-revolutionary of the western powers. On the other hand anthropologists are becoming increasingly subject to restrictions, unethical temptations and political controls from the U S Government and its subordinate agencies. The question is: what does an anthropologist do who is dependent on a counter-revolutionary government in an increasingly revolutionary world?||Kathleen Gough

9/9/1967- ||special articles||24477964||What Kind of Democracy in India? Case for the Presidential System||The Indian Constitution has modelled the Central Government on the British pattern. But how relevant is the British pattern to India, considering the size and diversity of India's population? The Indian Prime Minister, elected from one constituency and without a national mandate, cannot represent the whole nation; and the inevitable polarisation and factionalism in the ruling party weakens the Prime Minister by requiring that he satisfy the various factions in the choice of his ministers. The country needs a Government which not only represents but also achieves results. It needs a strong, unified and purposeful Government which can make the most of its material and human resources.||C M Belliappa
12/8/1967- ||special articles||24478113||Soviet Price Reform Controversy and Its Relevance for India||Since 1956 a vigorous discussion has been going on among Stalin's successors on Soviet planning techniques with a view to achieving greater economic efficiency. Apart from laying stress on greater decentralisation of planning, the discussion has centred on price reform, in the debate on which several Soviet economists have taken part. There was a provisional resolution of the controversy in 1963. The Soviet industrial price revision was supported and popularised by Evsei Liberman and other Soviet economists and dubbed as capitalist profit-orientation by many western as well as Chinese economists. In this brief article the author attempts to examine the views of the three main schools of Soviet economists on price reform and tries to find out the relevance of some of their views on administered price system of the public sector to the so-called socialist pattern of the Indian economy.||Bireshwar Ganguly

8/7/1967- ||special articles||24477937||Planning for Self-Sufficiency in Foodgrains||This is a study of India's immediate and longer-term food supply problems. The author does not consider it likely that population control will have a significant impact on population growth rates in India before 1985. If foodgrain self-sufficiency is to be attained, he estimates, foodgrain production will have to reach 113 million tons in 1971 and 136 million tons in 1976. Assuming an output of 87.4 million tons in 1967, self-sufficiency in 1971 will call for a rate of production increase of 6.8 per cent per year and self-sufficiency in 1976 for a rate of increase of 5 per cent, against the annual rate of increase of 2.4 per cent achieved over the past 14 years. With arable land increasing by only 0.44 per cent annually, even a 5 per cent per annum rate of growth of foodgrain output would require an increase in yield per hectare of 1.91 per cent per year. From a measurement of India's foodgrain problem, the author proceeds to examine whether our foodgrain production plans are realistic. He then makes his own assessment of how fast foodgrain yield can be increased in India and discusses the promise of improved seed varieties and fertiliser with assured irrigation and the principal elements of land utilisation. He recognises the economic limits to high fertiliser intensity and considers the all-important question whether the farmer will utilise his full production potential. Finally, the capital costs of achieving foodgrain self-sufficiency are estimated both in term of domestic investment and requirements of imports and foreign aid. Publication of this paper, it is hoped, will provoke controversy and elicit discussion on these vital aspects of our food production plans.||Willem Holst

We tend to think that the electorate has registered a massive vote of protest against the Congress; we wonder about the governments of States where the Congress has lost its majority; and in our flightier moments we also feel like speculating on the future of parliamentary democracy in the country. All these thoughts are misplaced. Things have changed much less than we think, and they will continue to be the same much more than we think.||Ashok V. Desai

Krishna Murti's exercise is for the country as a whole. The picture painted by him may be even darker if some micro-studies are made on the lines of his analytical framework.

Besides, tax subsidies related to the cost of equipment also distort the choice of techniques by companies. Finally, it is the established company with taxable income from its existing operations which gets the full benefit of investment allowances, whereas a new company which has a long gestation period may have to wait for many years before tax relief becomes effective. Thus investment allowances coupled with high and progressive tax rates would promote excessive investment and unwarranted mechanisation and, what is more, they would help established industries more than new products which would more often be undertaken by new companies. A tax holiday, by comparison, avoids these disadvantages of the investment allowances.||G. Narayanan

1/2/1967- ||perspective on the general election||4357552||Citizens and Government: A Comparative Analysis||The attitude of citizens to authority, and administrative officials particularly, is crucial for the functioning of a democracy. How the public evaluates the performance of officials, whether the public feels governmental programmes are worthwhile and necessary, the extent to which the public is willing to support official programmes, attitudinally and by co-operative behaviour, and the degree of public confidence in the integrity and efficiency of the administration-all these are significant elements which need study in order to understand the public's orientation towards the political system. Any interpretation of public attitude and behaviour must, however take cognisance of the requirements of the particular society. The data presented in this study were collected in two investigations of public attitudes towards administrators in two metrovolitan areas located in two distinct cultures and political systems. [The author is greatly indebted to his two Indian co-investigators, A P Barnabas and V Jagannadhan of the Indian Institute of Public Administration, for the design and execution of the Indian study.]||Samuel J.

It represents a 'sub-nation' trying to assert its identity on the basis of history and language. The example of the Shiv Sena has not been lost on other regions, even within Maharashtra. Similar organisations are sprouting up, for instance, in Konkan and Vidarbha. It has not been sufficiently realised by Indian leaders that the approach to nation-building in India has to be on a basis different from that in the West. In the West, nations were built on the basis of language and history. In India, however, the attempt to seek in language, history or religion the factors for national or sub-national identification will spawn movements like the Shiv Sena and will divide society instead of integrating it.||R S Morkhandikar

17/6/1967- ||special articles||4358065||Voting Pattern in the Fourth General Election. I: D M K Success in Madras||Madras was one of the better administered States under the Congress. Why then was the Congress routed in the elections by the United Front with the DMK at its centre-piece? The Congress organisation was no match for the DMK whose sustained campaigning at the grass-roots level evoked a strong popular response, especially as memories of the linguistic disturbances of early 1965 were still fresh. But what turned the DMK's advantages into a resounding victory was its strategy of forging an electoral arrangement with the Swatantra and the CPI (M). This helped the DMK to enlist support which cut across caste and class alignments. The study of voting pattern attempted here brings out the depth of support for the United Front. A large proportion of its seats were won by overwhelming majorities. In ten of the fourteen districts, again, the United Front secured an absolute majority of the votes polled, a feat which the Congress failed to perform in even a single district. The analysis also shows that the United Front swept the polls in most of the major towns in the State and that the hold of the Congress on scheduled caste constituencies, traditionally Congress strongholds, has been lost. [This is the first of a series of articles on the voting pattern in the different States in the general elections.]||N. S. Siddhartan

11/2/1967- ||special articles||4357589||Implications of National Food Budget||The considerations to be borne in mind while preparing the National Food Budget, according to the Foodgrains Policy Committee, are: (1) consumption pattern in different States; (2) traditional inter-State inflows and outflows of different foodgrains; (3) prevailing prices; and, (4) prospects of foodgrain production in the year to which the Food Budget relates. These will not, however, provide an objective basis for determining the surplus or deficit in each State since the problem of equitable distribution of foodgrains does not call only for assessment of the surplus or deficit of each State for the purpose of inter-State movement of foodgrains. Basically the problem is one of movement of foodgrains from the rural sector to the urban sector; and this is as much relevant to the surplus States as to the deficit States. In other words we have first to assess the requirements of urban areas and then to determine what part of these for each State can be met by internal procurement and what part by imports from other States or from abroad. An attempt has been made in this article to suggest on these lines an alternative basis for the formulation of National Food Budget.||S. S. Madalgi

Hazari also provides a wealth of detail on the techniques used by business houses to acquire and maintain control over the companies in their fold and throws valuable light on the disjunction or conjunction of ownership and control. This review article examines the factual findings of Hazari's study and its policy conclusions in the context of the real question at issue which is: are oligopolistic organisations good for the citizen and can these be avoided in a modern private enterprise economy such as India?||Amiya Bagchi

11/3/1967- ||special articles||4357691||Towards a Functional Budget||The present budgetary system was evolved to meet the needs of a colonial government. It is unsuited to the financial and physical evaluation and control that has to accompany developmental expenditure. If the national budget is to be more than an exercise in wishful thinking it will have to be made very much more functional in its composition and formulation. This means that the budget must incorporate the project estimates fixed on the basis of systematic cost-benefit analysis and work-studies, that the components of the budget must reflect this individual assessment which has preceded the final budget, and that there must be subsequent financial and physical control related in detail to the functional allocation under the budget. Only in this way can the budget be an effective tool in national planning and financial management, not merely an arbitrary accounting system. It will take time, however, to establish the necessary reporting and evaluating network, to cultivate the skills for such evaluation, and to construct the organisational machinery that will have to be entrusted with feeding data and keeping track of whether performance and expenditure have kept pace with the budget aims. [For reasons of space, this article is printed in two parts. In the first part, which appears below, the author examines the deficiencies of the existing system of budgeting and the general objectives which a satisfactory system ought to fulfill. In the second part, to appear next week, the general objectives will be reduced to definite tasks in specific fields.]||A. Premchand

These are concepts evolved by Western scholars whose primary interest was to reconcile the emergence of free underdeveloped nations with the existing system without having to alter that system drastically. Hence protection of concepts such as 'legitimisation' and 'modernisation'. The continued use of concepts, however, limits our horizon for change and yields distorted conclusions about our condition. The responsibility for this intellectual subservience is that of our intelligentsia who live in society without being of it. Consequently they fail to share its experiences and cannot formulate analytical concepts to fit those experiences.||Anirudha Gupta

20/5/1967- ||special articles||4357960||Fiscal Policy Must Be Reoriented||Some of the basic premises of our fiscal policy are valid in the context of our conditions and support the case for growing government sector. But they do not require nor do they justify a purely revenue approach to taxation or a high rate of growth of government consumption. Also, in translating any theory of fiscal policy into practice, institutional and administrative realities have to be taken into account. As it has happened, we have scarcely paid any attention to the problem of efficiency in government spending and to devising ways of measuring relative benefits from increases in government expenditure in different directions. Failing to do this, we have permitted increases in public expenditure which are clearly unjustified and wasteful. Thus although all our present economic difficulties cannot be blamed on fiscal policy, it must share a good part of the blame and a review and reform of fiscal policy will thus not only contribute to the revival of the forces of growth but is urgently called for as a matter of long-term policy. An attempt is made in this paper to point out the major changes needed in tax policy and to outline a policy for the growth of collective consumption.||R. J. Chelliah

1/2/1967- ||focus on development||4357565||Case for More Active Credit Planning||One of the areas of planning policy and techniques to which sufficient attention has not been paid in India is credit planning and the instruments and institutions necessary for it. Credit policy has been generally regarded as something concerned with the current economic situation, whose role is that of reacting to an actual or expected turn of events through either overall or sectoral credit expansion or contraction. True, an attempt has been made, beginning with the Third Plan, to frame a monetary budget for the economy coinciding with the plan period. The estimate of the economy's monetary requirements has proceeded on the basis of a projected rate of real income growth and assumption about the rate of decline in the income velocity and the value of the money multiplier; but the monetary and credit estimates still need to be filled in in terms of the resources estimates for the banking system. While this is the position with regard to credit planning at the stage of plan formulation, the potentiality of credit policy as an instrument of planning is being increasingly realised at the stage of plan implementation. But for any policy of directing the flow of credit to be effective there has to be credit planning at the stage of formulating the sectoral targets of investment and output so that the Reserve Bank would have an indication of at least the broad orders of magnitude of the sectoral requirements of credit.||M.

01/4/1967- ||special articles||4357768||Growth in the Macro-Economic Perspective||The necessary condition for development in underdeveloped economies is a rate of growth of capital higher than the rate of growth of population. There is always some possibility, in these economies, of raising the rate of growth of capital in the non-disguised unemployment sector. There may be some possibility too of raising the rate of saving in the disguised unemployment sector. But if the increase is not sufficient for the rate of growth of capital to exceed the rate of growth of population, the factors strategic for development then become the rate of inflow of capital, population planning and socialism. The policy implications of this analysis are discussed here. [The author is indebted to the A N Sinha Institute of Social Studies, Patna, for the opportunity for this study.

5/8/1967- ||special articles||24478046||The Phariya in an Inter-Tribal Market||This paper deals with the role of the Phariya, a socio-economic mediator, in the contemporary acculturative situation in the inter-tribal market of Banari in Chotanagpur, Bihar. When the Banari market was exposed to a wide variety of alien influences during the 1950s, the Phariya emerged as an institution for economic, social and cultural mediation between the natives and the outsiders. The name Phariya, literally translated as mediator, has come to designate a small group of people who have developed distinctive roles and patterns of behaviour and interaction in the market situation which help to reduce and stabilise the pressures of acculturation on the natives of the hinterland. The Phariya functions both as an agent of acculturation and as a cushion against cultural disintegration in the hinterland. He has linked the native economy, based on barter, to the modern self-regulating market by introducing money, the concept of price in relation to supply and demand, standardisation of products, the role of the middle-man and other modern market characteristics with far-reaching consequences both in the market and in the hinterland. In addition, his implicit cultural roles of innovation, communication and interpretation have been instrumental in closing the gap between the native and the alien cultures. By creating for himself a new role as an informal leader, not only in economic matters in the market place, but also in the hinterland, the Phariya has come to constitute the principal medium for translating, interpreting and communicating the values and ideology of the natives and the alien newcomers to one another.||D P Sinha

1/8/1967- ||the political watershed||24477855||India's Political Transition||A change of political institutions — like replacing federalism by a unitary system or introducing Presidential form of Government in the States while retaining the Parliamentary form at the Centre — will not solve the problems that have arisen as a result of the disintegration of the 'Congress system' of politics and lead to the realignment that is needed for political stability and administrative performance. The only way to bring about this realignment is to force its pace by compelling the political parties, including the Congress, to consciously make their choices both in respect of policy perspectives and in terms of the particular sections of the national electorate they want to appeal to. The major parties have to be forced to develop their legislative strength on the basis of genuine and sustained electoral organisation and to hasten the essential process of political polarisation. The parties have also to be forced to cultivate autonomous bases of power instead of relying on pockets of patronage and feudal or communal loyalties. Further, weak and fragmented parties must be forced to close their own ranks and, under threat of extinction, to merge with other similar parties. Finally, the process of 'secularisation' of voting behaviour must be carried further by forcing the electorate to realise the consequences, at the national and the State level, of their parochial behaviour. For all these objectives to be realised two or three elections will be needed. But a considerable step towards them can be taken with even one election at this critical juncture.||Rajni Kothari

18/11/1967- ||special articles||24478428||The Economics of Improved Seeds||This study attempts to examine the economics of one variety of hybrid maize. Experiments in the use of this hybrid variety in Punjab and U P have yielded, on the whole, very satisfactory results in terms of additional yield per acre and additional net income to the farmer. The wide variation noticed in yields from the hybrid maize, however, indicates that the same variety of improved seed cannot be recommended for all soil regions within a State. There is need for thorough and extensive soil tests. On the basis of the results of these tests alternative varieties can be suggested for farms where a particular hybrid has not been successful. This presupposes close co-ordination between agricultural scientists and extension staff not only at the national or State level but at the district and block levels — a condition which does not obtain today.||Hari Dev Goyal

If we are not to get lost in totally irrelevant questions, we should go beyond whether the Fourth Plan outlay ought to be Rs 23,750 crores or whether Rs 18,000 crores would be more "realistic" and ask: (1) Have we embarked on planning without being prepared for it? (2) Have we attempted to plan for economic and social transformation without sorting out carefully the factors which are of crucial significance to the process of planning? (3) Is planning for rapid economic and social change consistent with a parliamentary framework of the British type? Unless we give serious thought to our political institutions and their functions, we may get deeper and deeper into a crisis which might extend much beyond an inadequate rate of economic growth.||D.

03/6/1967- ||special articles||4358015||Sociology of Medicine in India: An Approach||Sociologists in India have more or less neglected sociology of medicine as a field of study. One may approach the subject by exploring the broad features of medicine in India and of the wider society and then relating the two in order to determine the link between medicine and society. An attempt is made in the first part of this article to show the relationship of medicine to other aspects of society. The second part deals with different systems of medicine in India and suggests an approach to the sociological study of medicine. In the third part some aspects of sociology of medicine are indicated along with some problems for study. The final section deals with sociological study of the hospital and shows how it provides a framework for the study of other aspects of sociology of medicine in India.

1/8/1967- ||the political watershed||24477858||Changing Political Behaviour in Rural Indian Society||What makes Indian politics so distinctive at the village level when compared with other societies which practise universal adult franchise is the incredibly elaborate social composition of the electorate. Where in other societies one finds a handful of socially diverse groups whom politicians must fit into their calculations, in India the number of such groups is usually formidable. This makes the job of political calculation that much more intricate and makes it that much more inevitable that Indian politicians will think in terms of ethnic variables when making their calculations. This paper attempts to throw light on the kind of order that has characterised political change in India's villages in the last few decades. It is possible, the author suggests, to identify three stages of political change with a different model of political behaviour appropriate to each. Three sets of rules have existed in the three periods to determine who was eligible to be a village leader and who was privileged to decide who that leader would be. These rules naturally have to be viewed against the background of the social organisation and economic conditions prevailing in each of the three periods. The inevitable further changes in economic conditions and social organisation in village India will almost certainly be accompanied by still further changes in political rules and by other models of political behaviour which will produce their own styles of politicians.||Harold A Gould

25/2/1967- ||special articles||4357639||Pre-Independence Thinking on Agrarian Policy||In the history of economic ideas one often comes across old controversies and debates being revived in later periods in new circumstances. The agrarian policy debate falls in the category of such controversies. The contributions of Ranade and Dutt and of later nationalists like Nehru to this debate in the pre-independence period seem to have a familiar ring to a contemporary student of agrarian affairs. In fact, these nationalists seem to have anticipated many of the divergent approaches to the agrarian problem put forward by contemporary protagonists. The review of thinking on agrarian policy before independence attempted here brings out the basic unity as well as the divergences of the nationalist approach to agrarian questions. The unity lay in the critique of the official British ideas from a common standpoint. The divergences are reflected in the existence of broadly two trends of thought on the nature of institutional changes required for renovation of agriculture. The first trend favoured a policy of transforming the landlord class into an engine of growth and considered a framework of inequality and concentration of land and other resources in the hands of an enterprising class to be an economic necessity. The second trend, on the other hand, was inclined to assign a decisive role to the peasantry in economic development.||P. C. Joshi
14/10/1967- ||special articles||24478169||Recession, Inflation and Economic Policy||The current recession is not primarily of the Keynesian type, caused by decline in demand; decline in input supplies is at least as important. It is necessary to emphasise this both for clarity of analysis and for getting at the correct anti-recession policy prescriptions. To the extent that there is a recession in demand, a cautious push to investment is of course called for to perk up demand, to break supply bottlenecks in specific lines and to put the economy back on the path of growth. There is, however, one kind of facile argument which should be guarded against. This argument says: What does it matter if price inflation occurs? Price stability is not one of our major objectives; our aim should be growth; we can always take care of inflation through price controls. This kind of reasoning is false and dangerous. The greatest single lesson of our economic experience of the last few years is that inflation dries up resources for investment, eats into growth and discredits planning.||A M Khusro

In order to understand political reality one has to study the men who direct these institutions. This paper examines the social characteristics of political executives of Panchayati Raj institutions in Andhra. An attempt is made to throw light on their social origins, educational levels and economic status. More specifically, it is proposed to test the following widely-held hypotheses: (a) Panchayati Raj institutions are controlled by the upper classes of rural society; (b) the leadership of these institutions is mostly illiterate; and, (c) political executives of Panchayati Raj do not have previous experience of public office.||G Ram Reddy

1/8/1967- ||external balance||24477865||Brain Drain: The Indian Situation||The disease that has gone deep down and which underlies the entire phenomenon of Brain Drain is, it is argued here, the class and income structure for the intellectuals which we have inherited from British rule. This structure has two characteristic features. First, it places a high premium, both in terms of status and income on the professions vis-a-vis the rest of the society. Second, it has created inordinate inequalities, again in terms of status and income, within the intellectual ranks. The class and income structure for intellectuals has had two consequences. It has resulted in the intellectual class alienating themselves totally from the rest of the society; leaving the country is only one step further in the intellectuals' alienation and does not cause them great pain. And it has lead to anything but an intellectual life within the intellectual ranks, which have been infiltrated by wrong persons with wrong aptitudes and wrong motivations. The remedy must begin where the disease is located. The high premium placed on university education and degrees must be reduced and the inequality within the intellectual ranks must be narrowed down. Once these are accepted, inevitably the country's borders will have to be closed and physical contact with developed countries regulated. But though the doors have to be closed to protect ourselves from the lure of high living abroad and thus from being robbed of our talented persons, the windows will remain open through which all knowledge may enter freely and selected young men may go abroad for specific job training and return home. In other words, we have to be more selective, discriminating and purposeful in our contacts with the developed countries.||V M Dandekar

7/10/1967- ||special articles||24478214||Social Security Legislation in India—II: The Employees' Provident Fund Scheme||In the first part of this article, which appeared last week, the author examined the working of the Employees' Provident Fund Scheme which, together with the Employees' State Insurance Scheme, constitutes the core of social security in India. The working of the two schemes leaves no doubt that the concept of social security has been in practice narrowed to the point of absurdity in India. First, the coverage of the schemes is microscopic. The schemes have mostly benefited the better organised wage earners and middle-class salary earners. Second, social security in its essence implies income security, but neither of these schemes was intended to safeguard even the small proportion of the labour force covered in this essential respect. Finally, the idea of social security implies centralisation of authority in a single institution capable of controlling the operation of social security schemes throughout the country. But in India the Government acts merely as an administrative authority and is unable to use its coercive authority to compel recalcitrant employers to fulfil their obligations. In this, the second part of the article, the author examines the working of the Employees' State Insurance scheme. The scheme is social only insofar as the employees pool their resources to obtain some security during their work-life. Here, as in the case of the Employees' Provident Fund, the Government has failed to exact the legitimate contributions from employers. And the State's own contribution to the scheme is negligible.||Manorama G Savur

But to what extent can the ills of Indian planning be cured by our adopting French planning methods as has been frequently demanded, mostly by spokesmen of the private sector? Given the fact that the tasks of economic planning in India are so different from those in France, can planning by persuasion be expected to have quite the impact on our economy that it has had on the French?||Ashok Rudra

10/6/1967- ||special articles||4358041||National Income in the Fourth Plan: How Fast Can It Grow?||According to the Draft Outline of the Fourth Plan, national income will grow at an average rate of 5.5 per cent per annum. At the same time, a growth rate of 5.6 per cent per annum for agriculture and 11.0 per cent per annum for industrial production is assumed in the Draft Outline. It is unlikely, however, that the growth rate of agricultural and industrial production would be higher than that of national income. This paper attempts two independent estimates of national income for the Fourth Plan period-one on the assumption that the Plan's agricultural and industrial growth rates will be fulfilled, and the other on the more realistic assumption that the rates of growth of agriculture and industry will be lower than envisaged in the Draft Outline. The national income estimate on either of these assumptions is lower than the figure envisaged in the Draft Outline.||A. G. Majumdar

The politics of alienation, it is often forgotten, operates as much on a tribal basis. Just as fear of domination by the plains people forms the basis of the demand for autonomous political status for the Hills tribes, tribes which are relatively backward fear domination by the more advanced tribes. This explains why the Mikir and Cachar Hills tribes are opposed to a separate Hills State though they are in favour of greater autonomy for the Hills districts within the present set-up. The creation of a new political unit for the Hills tribes is no substitute for a clearly conceived tribal policy which the Government of India does not have. The lack of policy for the tribes is reflected in the Government's failure to solve the Naga and Mizo problems. The same fate may befall its misguided efforts to tackle the problems of the other tribes.||Birendra Kumar Bhattacharyya

18/11/1967- ||special articles||24478427||Fifty Revolutionary Years||The problem singled out for discussion here does not relate immediately to the great achievements within the Soviet Union since the Bolshevik break-through in November 1917. It is that of combining peaceful co-existence with solidarity of world revolutionary forces outside the Soviet Union. The problem can be capsuled as the search for the best strategy in the context of two fundamental unevenly developing processes. One is the unevenness of development of revolutionary outbreaks. The other is the tremendous differences between the countries and the movements that accomplish this break-through. These differences relate not merely to the varying composition of the revolutionary movements but also to the different international positions they occupy after their triumph, i e, the different tactics pursued vis-a-vis them by the imperialist powers. This is at the heart of the controversy with the Chinese communists and appears to be at the centre of the differences that are already developing between the Cuban communist leadership and other Latin American communists.||Mohit Sen

These estimates are compared with the projections based on the labour force participation rates recorded by the 1961 Census of India. The reasons for the apparent rejection of the 1961 census data on economic activity by the Planning Commission are examined. It is concluded that the labour force projections based on the census data are likely to approximate more closely the total number of persons available for work. Therefore, planning policies based on the official labour force projections will probably lead to a greater volume of unemployment in the years ahead than what is currently envisaged as inevitable.||Pravin M Visaria

II: The Fiscal Possibilities||The two main problems facing the economy, as discussed in the first part of this article which appeared last week, are the inflationary spiral and the stagnation in industry, both of which have become more intractable over the last year. In the circumstances, the scope for bold fiscal measures would appear to be limited. There is the danger that a heavy dose of taxes, particularly direct taxes, may impair business confidence and thereby strengthen the recessionary forces. There is also the danger that failure to step up investment may also reinforce these forces. On the other hand, deficit financing and easy money would further strain the price level. It is in this context that this article discusses the fiscal possibilities before the Finance Minister in framing the Budget for 1967-68.||Arthagnani

An attempt is made below to examine the characteristics of applicants for Congress tickets. The examination will, it is hoped, throw light on the relationship between the Congress party and its environment. It will also show what kinds of persons are preferred by the Congress as its nominees to fight the election.||Ramashray Roy

While admitting that caste influences political parties, as well as the Government and administration, it is argued here that politics also influences caste with consequences that undermine caste solidarity and startification.||I.

7/10/1967- ||special articles||24478213||The SDRs and International Liquidity||This critical evaluation of the Special Drawing Rights scheme, approved in principle at last month's meeting of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund, shows that the addition to international reserves sought to be made in the form of SDRs will not make any material contribution to increasing the supply of international reserves or to restoring equilibrium in international payments. Any perceptible improvement in the supply of international liquidity will require the creation of a far larger amount of SDRs than envisaged in the present scheme and higher utilisation limits. Further, the scheme contains no provision for rational distribution of SDRs among countries in relation to their external obligations. An adequate solution to the problem of international liquidity can be provided only by a scheme which leads to (i) proper distribution of international reserve assets among countries; and, (ii) an automatic flow of excess reserves from the surplus countries to an international agency like the I M F so as to bring about a close relationship between international savings and investments of individual countries. With these objectives in view an attempt is made here to suggest an alternative plan for augmenting international liquidity.||R N Bhattacharya

This is true no doubt, but it is difficult to agree with Gopal Krishna's view that this trend necessarily implies that Muslims are becoming increasingly secularised politically or that communal solidarity is being subjected to pressure by electoral competition. The available evidence seems to suggest that Indian Muslims, particularly in North India, are trying to consolidate themselves politically so as to be able to influence the political process directly.||Imtiaz Ahmed
08/4/1967- ||special articles||4357791||Monetary Policy in the Current Busy Season: Its Impact on the Money Market||The credit policy for the 1966-67 busy season had laid down a limit upto which Reserve Bank would lend to scheduled banks at the Bank Rate of 6 per cent; borrowing beyond this limit was to attract a minimum penal rate of 10 per cent. This created a situation in which the inter-bank call market rate could be expected to go up to near 10 per cent. But how can one explain an inter-bank rate of 12 per cent? An excessively high inter-bank call rate not merely affects the banks concerned but in the end its consequences fall on the marginal borrower, particularly the small entrepreneur. For the class of small entrepreneurs credit has become not only highly expensive but also virtually unobtainable. This serious distortion of interest rates could have been prevented by an active policy of open market purchases of government securities from the market or the banks. But, unfortunately, the authorities have taken a passive attitude in the belief that what happens in the inter-bank market is not a matter of concern to them.||H. T. Parekh

10/6/1967- ||special articles||4358039||Roots of Political Instability in Africa||Most African leaders are faced with the problem of nation-building while at the same time having to legitimise their hold on political power. The two objectives are not always complementary. Besides, the measures which a political elite adopts might, paradoxically enough, weaken its overall hold on the country. This makes necessary a study of the African evolues-the elite-and the role they are playing in their national communities. The immediate issue is whether African systems can expand the base of the elite class, recruit new ones and thus create a consensus in favour of their systems. So far the findings of sociologists do not make one optimistic about the success of this process. The tendency, therefore, is to perpetuate a social class into a status group, tending towards exclusiveness and assumption of social position through the family. As a result politics in most newly-independent countries show tension between different groups of the elite competing for higher benefits, tensions between elite and the people which are expressed also in terms of ethnic, cultural and other kinds of conflicts, and tensions between the ruling elite and other organised professional or military groups. Trends show that all these factors may work simultaneously giving rise to new tensions, conflicts and sudden political upheavals.||Anirudha Gupta

16/9/1967- ||special articles||24478000||Involvement in Social Change: A Plea for Own Ideas||A scholarly tradition of leaning heavily, if not abjectly, on ideas borrowed from the West is growing in this country. This is clear from the post-independence writings of a large number of Indian social scientists and the research policies of some of our modern research institutions. The borrowed ideas and concepts, when accepted uncritically, obscure the major issues involved in planned social change and stand in the way of posing the right kind of questions in the study of social change. But the trend of uncritical borrowing of ideas and models is a symptom rather than the cause of the malaise. Many Indian scholars lean on these borrowed concepts because they have been brought up in a social environment where they do not develop a firm conviction that their knowledge would be put to the test of solving urgent social problems.||Surajit Sinha

To achieve these objectives, the approach has to be (i) from the side of the quantities of foodgrains which the state purchases, holds in stock and distributes to consumers; and, (ii) from the side of the prices at which it purchases and distributes foodgrains.||S.

The Komeito has been the focus of growing interest and its success or failure will be closely watched for clues about the future of Japanese politics. Interest in the Komeito is largely explained by three basic factors: its religious origins, its electoral successes and the potential of its 'reformist' appeal. Continued success for the Komeito depends on its ability, first, to change the voting behaviour of its adherents along with their religious belief and, second, to convince the mass of the Japanese people that it has a viable programme quite apart from its religious appeal. How far does its success in the last elections establish its ability in these two crucial directions?||Roderick B. Dugliss

23/12/1967- ||special articles||24478315||Labour Inputs, Wages and Productivity on Indian Farms||This paper examines the relationship between labour inputs, wages and productivity and the impact which availability of family labour has on the use of labour in farming. The analysis, based on data from the Farm Management Studies, indicates that because of the high family-labour content of total labour input, difference between marginal productivity and wage rates does not fully explain differences in labour input. The difference between marginal productivity and prevailing wage rates is relevant in determining the use of hired labour whereas use of family labour is mainly governed by its availability. Yet, though use of family-labour is governed by its overall availability, a part of family labour is actually withheld from entering the production process because the low marginal productivity does not fully justify the sacrifice involved in working. Increased employment of unutilised family labour, thus, depends on increase in marginal productivity of labour through improved techniques of production which are labour intensive.||Harpal Singh

The tradeoffs are examined between: (a) the rate of growth of domestic consumption, (b) the near-term aid requirements, and (c) the date by which self-reliance is to be reached. The author examines the case in which India wishes to reduce its dependence on external assistance at a gradual pace over time, and yet maintain a rate of consumption growth above that which is initially compatible with the country's internal resources. In these conditions, it is suggested that there would be severe difficulties in attempting to reach self-reliance within a period as short as five years. A large fraction of aid would have to be devoted to preparing for the termination of aid, rather than for promoting the near-term growth of consumption. If a five-year self-reliance target were to be adopted and the annual output-capital ratio were 0.40, this would imply that for each Rs 100 crores of external assistance during the initial year, there would have to be an allocation of Rs 41 crores of aid to end aid. A numerical example is presented with an internally consistent set of time paths for consumption, investment, and the input of external resources.||Alan S Manne

In formulating his budget proposals, the Finance Minister will naturally need to take a hard look at the state of the economy. He will need to recognise the fact that the basic causes of the present economic situation are not the monetary or fiscal policies followed in the last two years, but real economic factors, the two most important of which are deficiency of aggregate demand - the result of the decline in national income in 1965-66 and of the likely small rise in 1966-67 - and imbalances between demand and supply in particular sectors - the result of faulty planning. To offset these factors has to be the principal objective of the Budget.||Arthagnani

1/2/1967- ||focus on development||4357566||Export Policy for the Fourth Plan||Planned growth of national income is crucially constrained by the availability of foreign exchange. To achieve the annual growth rate of five and a half per cent forecast for the Fourth Five-Year Plan, project and maintenance imports worth Rs 7,500 crores would be required over the five-year period ending in 1970-1. As debt repayment and service charges will total Rs 1,450 crores, foreign exchange requirements for the Fourth Plan will add up to a staggering sum of Rs 9,100 crores. The export target set at Rs 5,100 crores is, thus, expected to finance no more than two-thirds of the inflow of commodity imports leaving a foreign exchange gap of Rs 1,000 crores. The Fourth Plan export target, modest as it appears in relation to foreign exchange requirements, will nonetheless involve a more than 50 per cent increase in export earnings by 1970-71 as compared to the terminal year of the Third Plan. This paper attempts to analyse the recent improvement in export performance, and the policies underlying it, with the intention of exploring departures in policy and practice that the accomplishment of the Fourth Plan export programme may impose. [I am indebted to my colleague, Robert C Repetto, Associate at the Ford Foundation in India, for his interest and many helpful suggestions.

Based on detailed statistical relationships and other empirical data, this and the next article, which will appear in a subsequent issue of this journal, seek to test the viability of the Indian model of democracy and assess its capacity to promote the development of an integrated secular policy. The author examines changes in voter participation by demographic, literacy, occupational and economic factors. Among the more political factors influencing voter turnout are the number of candidates, the closeness of the contest and the splitting of double-member constituencies, each of these influencing the mobilisation of the vote. Voter participation also displays a significant regional variation, especially between the southern and the northern States. The article shows how voting patterns of minority communities on the one hand and castes on the other have effected a considerable process of integration and secularisation. Although they had started with an emphasis on caste and communal appeals, electoral politics have gradually eroded the solidarity of sectarian groups. The integration of the Muslim population in the electoral process is remarkable from this point of view. Equally striking is the secularisation of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe groups.

30/9/1967- ||special articles||41626877||Devaluation and Exports: An Interim Assessment||While export earnings have recorded a steep decline since the devaluation in June last year, it is necessary to carefully examine the possible reasons for this decline before passing judgement on the devaluation. In the first place, a substantial proportion of our exports are agriculture biased and are characterised by low supply elasticities in the short period. This factor has been aggravated by the two successive droughts and the fact that the economy has been in the grip of an inflation. It should have been possible through appropriate fiscal measures to divert output from the domestic to the export sector, but no such measures have been forthcoming. Second, the export duties imposed immediately after the devaluation must share a large part of the blame for the fall in export earnings. In fact, export earnings declined for every item on which duties were levied with the exception of hides and skins. Finally, a large proportion of the decline in foreign exchange earnings since the devaluation actually took place in June and July 1966. This was due to two factors mainly: there was some confusion immediately after the devaluation over contracts entered into earlier, particularly with the East European countries; and there was widespread expectation that the Government would announce new export incentives in place of those which had been withdrawn. In assessing the impact of the devaluation it is also important to note that the rupee value of exports has gone up substantially in respect of commodities which account for 97 per cent of our total exports. This would indicate that there has been an appreciable increase in the aggregate turnover of these industries which is bound to be reflected in their profitability. This emphasises the allocative aspect of the devaluation and the resultant improvement in economic efficiency. Further, one of the objectives of the devaluation was to provide a fillip to our non-traditional exports. While earnings from the major export items have dropped for the reasons mentioned above, minor exports have fared well in general. Thus it would seem that the devaluation has set in motion forces making for diversification of our exports. This is an important gain.||G C da Costa

24/6/1967- ||special articles||4358091||Voting Pattern in Fourth General Election. II: Congress Still Strong in Andhra||The 1967 General Election found both the Congress and the Communists, the two leading political forces in Andhra, divided among themselves. The Swatantra party by contrast was plagued neither by the group rivalaries of the Congress nor the ideological tensions of the Communists. The results of the Election reflect the state of the three parties. The Congress suffered a decline in both the proportion of seats won in the Assembly as well as in that of votes polled. The decline, however, was much sharper in the case of the two Communist parties. By contrast the Swatantra party, by concentrating its effort on a relatively small number of constituencies, was able to sharply raise its strength in the Assembly. If we consider the three broad regions of Andhra - the Circars, Rayalaseema and Telengana - the Swatantra party improved its position in the Circars and Rayalaseema but lost whatever base it had in Telengana. The two Communist parties taken together lost heavily in the Circars and Telengana but marginally improved their position in Rayalaseema. But despite the setback it suffered, the data presented in this article brings out clearly that the Congress is the only State-wide party with ramifications extending to the lowest levels and with a sizeable hard-core support.

27/5/1967- ||special article||4357988||Power Elite Planning for People's Welfare||The Government of India institutionalised its alliance with Big Business and launched "planned economic development", the two applying their combined mighty organisational strength reinforced by foreign Governments and foreign big business. The result has been a largely self-contained expansion characterised by a Suspension Pyramid controlled by the magnetic pull of the Power Elite at the top, drawing resources from the base, and principally serving the top layers. Bringing down the Suspension Pyramid, cutting the top down to size and making it answerable to the base is a mighty organisational challenge. The most promising beginnings of this process the author finds in Madras Chief Minister Annadurai's statement that "the Plan should be formulated in the villages, then in the State capital and in the final stage at the Centre." Discussion on this very important subject is invited.

The Survey also formed the basis of the Finance Minister's review of the economic situation contained in the first part of his Budget speech. In this article we attempt a critical review of these two documents. The major defect of the Economic Survey is that, while it describes the trees very well, it does not present a picture of the wood. Even in describing the trees, there are important omissions which ultimately lead to a distorted view of the economic situation. Some of these omissions will be pointed out in the second part of the article.||R K Amin

This paper describes the participation of women in different service occupations and changes in such participation since 1951. An attempt has also been made to analyse the probable future need for women workers in one important sector - education. This has been done with a view to focussing attention on the problem of supply of and demand for educated women workers. The participation rate of educated women, the paper brings out is very low and this low rate imposes severe limitations on the speed at which the number of women workers can be increased in the modern service occupations.

Income elasticities obtained thus were very different from the usually accepted cross-section elasticities from the National Sample Survey (NSS); and the elasticities of necessaries (like foodgrains) and of luxuries were much closer to unity. The fitted model was utilised by Ashok Rudra in a very important discussion of the consequences of the proposed relative rates of growth of agriculture and industry. An attempt is made here to re-examine the Paul-Rudra estimates of elasticities. It is found that owing to limitations of data the estimates have very wide margins of error. Further, the most plausible "point" estimates are closer to the cross-section elasticities than Rudra and Paul seemed to suggest.||N Bhattacharya

1/2/1967- ||focus on development||4357558||Planning without a Policy Frame||The outstanding feature of the 'planned' Indian economy has been the total absence of a policy frame. The Government has deliberately avoided constructing such a frame under the influence of vested interests in private industry and trade and of planners who apparently believe that once a given rate of investment is achieved the eco'-omy will automatically function satisfactorily. The result has been that in the aggregate the economy has operated almost as a laissez faire economy, modified in part by certain specific controls. The successes of planning have been in areas where the Government has directly undertaken large programmes of public expenditure; its failures in areas where the planned use of resources has been left in private hands. A policy frame for the whole economy and a regulatory framework to carry it out are, therefore, imperative if planning is to be more successful in future than it has been so far. An attempt is made here to indicate, on the basis of an examination of the working of the economy over the last fifteen years, the primary objectives which the overall economic policy ought to espouse and the broad outlines of the appropriate regulatory framework.

23/9/1967- ||special articles||24478256||Indian Foreign Policy & Economic Development||During the Indo-Chinese conflict, it was suggested that the war effort would stimulate Indian industrial development. This argument was based on the experience of Western countries whose economies suffered from deficiency of effective demand in relation to productive capacity which the war effort helped to fill. By contrast, in countries like India where industrial capacity is yet to be established, defence expenditure can only stimulate inflation and expose even the scanty productive capacity that may exist to the danger of neglect through lack of proper maintenance and replacement. There can be no doubt that the rate of growth of the Indian economy in the sixties would not have been so low had not so much of our resources been used up for defence preparations. If foreign policy is to be regarded, as it should be, as a tool for furthering our economic interests, it follows that we should pursue policies consistent with keeping down our defence expenditure to the minimum.||N K Sarkar

16/12/1967- ||special articles||24478965||Economic Structure of Coffee Cultivation in India||A study of the size, yield and cost of production of coffee estates suggests that the bigger estates are generally more efficient than the smaller ones. However, since the smaller estates account for a major part of the area under coffee in the country and employ a large number of workers, any attempt to force mergers on them will have adverse socio-economic consequences. Though the optimum size for a coffee plantation is smaller than for tea or rubber, to earn even the average net annual income of an agricultural family in India, a coffee estate has to be between 7 and 15 acres. However, over 67 per cent of the coffee estates are below 5 acres. To increase efficiency in coffee production, therefore, the emphasis will have to be on improved techniques of cultivation and on co-operatives of the smaller estates along Danish lines for at least some of the operations which benefit most from scale.||N Debnath,G K Sarkar

The main objective of the study is to analyse the structure of imports and the scope for import-substitution in Indian industry within the context of the growth of the economy as a whole. Here the author describes briefly the programming model and discusses selectively some of the more interesting numerical results. [The study on which this article is based was carried out for the author's doctoral thesis "A Programming Model for Import Substitution in India", which was submitted to the Department of Economics, M I T, in June 1966.

9/12/1967- ||special articles||24478287||The DMK and the Politics of Tamilnad||Several factors led to the unexpected rout of the Congress in Madras in the fourth general elections. After several years in power the Congress had clearly become complacent. Acute rice scarcity caused much pre-election discontent. And the impact of the 1965 anti-Hindi agitation had not worked itself off on the electorate even by February 1967. The immediate cause of the Congress defeat, however, was the United Front forged by the opposition parties under the leadership of the DMK. The United Front contemporised the image of the DMK and the electoral arrangements within the alliance enabled the maximum exploitation of the respective strengths of the various parties.||S K S Nathan

11/3/1967- ||special articles||4357686||Poor Organisation to Blame for Congress Debacle||The effectiveness of the Congress as a political organisation rather than the record of the Government determined the party's fortunes in the elections. For a party which contested almost all the Assembly and Parliament seats, the Congress failed miserably to put across its policies. With very few exceptions, Congressmen chose the easy way to popularity by joining in opposition attacks on the party's policies. Where there was opposition to gold control, Congressmen did not hesitate to jump on the bandwagon. Similarly, many of them eagerly endorsed the demand for a ban on cow slaughter. In Madras the Congress vied with the DMK in opposing Hindi and in Kerala in demanding larger rice rations and the ship-building yard at Cochin. But the elections results have shown that this is a game at which the opposition can always beat the ruling party. Not only did the party not stand by the Government's policies, in many States and regions it just did not have the organisation necessary to win elections. As a result, Congressmen during the elections were like so many unattached independents, each fending for himself. In many areas there was no rapport even between the party's Assembly and Lok Sabha candidates. Further, the AICC having abdicated its responsibility of raising funds to finance the party's election campaign, a few party bosses cornered the funds and distributed them more with the object of getting their own supporters elected so that they could influence the choice of the Prime Minister rather than winning the election for the party.||G.

18/3/1967- ||special article||4357715||The Fourth Plan and Future Economic Policy||The investment programme envisaged in the Draft Outline of the Fourth Plan involves not only a doubling of the rate of growth of commodity production but also, possibly, a doubling of the marginal rate of saving in at least some years of the Plan period. The marginal rate of saving required would be even higher if the projected rate of growth of national income is not realised. The rate of growth of the economy, in turn, depends crucially on the growth rate in the agricultural sector since income from agriculture accounts for about 70 per cent of the total income from commodity production. The strategy for raising the rate of saving in the economy, as also the feasibility of the investment programme proposed in the Draft Outline, therefore, rest in the ultimate analysis on the performance in agriculture. The documents on the Fourth Plan show little awareness of the serious implications of this. On the contrary, there has been more than a suggestion that, even if there are shortfalls in agriculture, nothing more will be required than a few marginal adjustments. Not only does the investment programme taken as a whole rest on fair-weather assumptions about agriculture, but important segments of it depend on similar assumptions about the availability of foreign aid. The achievement of the growth rates in the industrial sector is so heavily dependent on foreign aid that their extreme vulnerability deserves more attention than either the internal consistency claimed for the targets or the considerable acceleration to be gained if they are realised. These considerations make it imperative to do some serious rethinking on the Fourth Plan. The Plan is now so sensitively structured that a slight wobble caused by any of its optimistic assumptions not being realised can result in sharp deviations from the path set out, possibly with far-reaching economic and political consequences. What is needed is a programme that is not so precariously balanced on extravagantly optimistic assumptions; one that will not be easily shaken by the shocks that an economy like India's must be expected to receive from time to time; one that is bold in choosing between difficult policy alternatives open within the system rather than in fixing impressive targets; and one that has sufficient flexibility in it yet to take advantage of favourable developments as and when they emerge. Since the growth rate likely to be reached in agriculture in the next few years cannot really be predicted with confidence, it would be better to proceed on the basis of alternative estimates of the overall growth rate based on different assumptions about the performance in agriculture. The investment programme could then be so prepared that (i) it can be implemented even if the higher growth rates aimed at in agriculture are not achieved, and (ii) it can be extended when improvements in the performance of agriculture warrant it. This would imply working for the present with a basic programme adjusted to a rate of growth of not more than about 3 per cent per annum in agriculture and 5 per cent in the economy as a whole, having ready in hand a supplementary programme which can be added on if higher growth rates are realised. A re-examination of the Fourth Plan along these lines, and the formulation of both a food distribution system and fiscal measures adequate to support the programme over a period will, of course, take some time. But it is difficult to see to what better purpose the next six months can be put. In fact, if the necessary preparatory work is done during this period, there would be a strong case for writing off 1966 and 1967 from the Fourth Plan and starting afresh from January 1968.||K. N.

25/3/1967- ||special articles||4357739||Student Protest in the U S||The student movements which have erupted in the 1960's are a new phenomenon in American campus life. Though nowhere in America have they had the political significance which student movements in countries of Latin America, in Japan, or in India have had, they signal a major change in the attitudes and norms of the American student, and have a great import for American society. Where only a few years ago the student tended to be rational and conservative about the problems of his day, the American student of today has become impatient with the previous generation's compromises and its acquiescence in a relentlessly organised society. The issues of the student protest movements range from racial discrimination, the war on poverty, and the war in Vietnam, to particular policies of the universities. The approach of even the radical students is pragmatic and experimental, not doctrinaire and theoretical. Only a small proportion of the students are activists, but on specific issues they are capable of involving many times their number. It is easy but not sufficient to explain what has happened to the students with reference to campus life only. What is important is that there is growing self-criticism in the United States generally. The affluent society is in the process of self-examination, aware that it has not paid enough attention to quality in life, aware that it is not sensitive and cultivated enough. This type of questioning must trouble any advanced society after it has solved its more obvious problems. Not unnaturally, in America, the most discontented, critical, and uncompromising sections are the educated young. Yet, though a few of them believe the flaws in American society are too deep to be changed through democratic processes, a large number, and most older Americans, are willing to trust the normal processes of democratic change.||Nathan Glazer

Immediate unrelated factors like these can be scarcely blamed for the poor progress of science in the country when factors directly related are seen to be severe obstacles. An attempt is made here to identify these factors and to suggest how they may be overcome.||Purnima Sinha

The two need to be kept distinct not merely because estimation is a task by itself. The intra-sectoral and inter-sectoral factors, in terms of which income structure needs to be analysed, cannot be directly used to build the overall income structure if the latter is not thought of in terms of a particular index like coefficient of variation. The influence of structural changes on the size distribution can be more fruitfully analysed by decomposing aggregate income by types of payments rather than by industrial origin. To the extent that the necessary data are not available, as an approximation the changes in the share of the top income group may be analysed in terms of intra-type and inter-type shifts.||K. R.

If the re-organised Planning Commission takes long to get into its strides and to work out the next steps in the development process, it may have already lost a major part of the battle. The Commission is thus going to be faced with a dilemma: should it first organise itself properly so that it can work most effectively or should it start working straightaway, as effectively as it can and with the instruments and personnel that it can speedily mobilise, so that the opportunities for reactivating the economy which may open up later this year with the expected good harvest can be made the best use of? Actually the Planning Commission may have to attempt both tasks simultaneously. Its effectiveness over the next few crucial years will depend upon the success with which it can combine them.||'Boswel'
9/9/1967- ||special articles||24477966||Trends in Trade Credit, 1951-52 to 1964-65||Trade credit is one of the more important sources of industrial finance. This study of trends in trade credit in the Indian corporate sector shows trade credit received and given to be one of the most important items in the balance sheet structure of the corporate sector. Over the period studied the corporate sector has become a net giver of trade credit. In 1951-52 all industry groups, except 'mining and quarrying' and 'other industries', were net receivers of trade credit. By 1964-65, however, all industry groups, except 'metals, chemicals and products thereof', had become net givers of trade credit. There appears to have been a positive correlation on the whole between sales and trade credit given on the one hand and inventories and trade credits received on the other. The movement of bank borrowings and trade credits was also generally in the same direction. A dear money policy thus does not seem to have the effect of liberalising trade credit practices.||L A Joshi

In this, the first part of the article, the authors examine the background against which gheraos developed in West Bengal. In subsequent parts, which will follow, the authors will statistically review the occurrence of gheraos in different trades and industries, the involvement of trade unions and political parties and the response of the employers affected. They will, in conclusion, examine the responsibility of the pattern of industrial relations evolved over the past two decades for building up the extreme resentment and frustration among employees which have found expression in gheraos.||Nitish R De,Suresh Srivastava

13/5/1967- ||special articles||4357933||Indian Foreign Policy, 1947-64||Indian foreign policy has been marked by a complete lack of ideological thinking, and, in fact, has been very pragmatic. It has been based on a coherent and valid model which embodies value assumptions that the author strongly supports. It would be a great pity therefore if, bewitched by the mechanistic models of the so-called realists, Indian foreign policy were to shelve the internationalist value assumptions in its model. Even by the test of preserving national security the Indian strategy has been remarkably successful. Its chief mistake was a miscalculation of the timing of the Chinese threat. This error, by any comparative standards, is not so grave as to condemn India's foreign policy which in achieving its avowed ends has been more successful than the foreign policies of most countries in the world. This paper has three objectives: to delineate the logical model underlying Indian foreign policy during the Nehru era; to test the internal consistency of this model and evaluate its realism and relevance in tackling the external problems faced by India from 1947 to 1964; and, finally, to evaluate its actual operation, especially in the light of criticisms made of it. There is one big omission in the discussion. It is the lack of any analysis of India's relations with Pakistan. This aspect of Indian foreign policy has been left untouched for a number of reasons, the most important of which is the author's belief that Indo-Pakistan relations are better looked at in the context of the historical evolution of the sub-continent as a whole. [For reasons of space this article is printed in two parts. In this, the first part, the author discusses the model on which India's foreign policy was based in the Nehru era and examines the strategy and tactics which this model entailed. In the second part, which will appear next week, the author will examine criticisms of our foreign policy related to the issue of military alliances, non-alignment and national physical security.]||Deepak Lal
5/8/1967- ||special articles||24478044||The Governor and the Constitution||A few months ago it was Rajasthan. Now it is Madhya Pradesh. The actions of the Governors in both States have become the subject of controversy. Unfortunately, in both cases the Governors concerned happened to be ex-Congressmen and the Chief Ministers Congressmen. Not surprisingly, therefore, allegations of partisanship have been made against the Governor by every opposition party. The two episodes serve to emphasise the fact that the Governorship has become an extremely delicate and difficult job in the changed political complexion of the country. A careful reading of the Constitutional provisions and an appreciation of them in the perspective of the total Constitutional scheme will show that the Governor, although a constitutional head of State, is not a figure-head but a functionary expected to play a vital role in the administration of the State.||M V Pylee

India could more profitably trade with these countries, because they are closer to her, because they too are short of hard currency, and because being at different stages of development their pattern of production is often complementary to hers. Regional economic integration of these countries would thus clearly offer the advantages of economies of scale and of specialisation according to the individual country's endowments. However, little attempt has been made by India to develop this natural sphere of influence. For the formulation of a strategy for this area the special needs and problems of the constituent countries have to be studied in depth. On that basis a liberal and imaginative policy of fostering closer economic relations can be launched.||H. T. Parekh

In tracing the price effects of commodity taxation, inter-industry relationships need to be particulary emphasised. Though taxes may be levied only on a few commodities, their impact is likely to be felt on the prices of a much larger number because of the flow of inputs and outputs among the various sectors of the economy. The sequence of price increases thus generated is here studied with the help of the interindustry transaction table prepared by the Perspective Planning Division of the Planning Commission.||P N Radhakrishnan,C Rangarajan

However, a number of students making empirical studies of Muslim communities in different parts of India have found that this distinction is not really meaningful in understanding the existing pattern among the diverse social groups in any locality. It may be asked, therefore, if the 'ashraf' and 'ajlaf' categories constitute meaningful units of distinction for the study of social stratification among Indian Muslims. If they do not, what is their relevance for sociological analysis? And how have these categories become part of the sociological vocabulary? An attempt is made here to answer some of these questions partly on the basis of extant literature and partly on the basis of field data from a predominantly Muslim multi-caste village in eastern Uttar Pradesh.||Imtiaz Ahmad
1/2/1967- ||focus on development||4357559||The Plan Frame and the Motive Power||The central thesis underlying D R Gadgil's assessment of the present economic situation and his prescriptions for the future is that the shape and direction of economic policy are largely the result of influence of vested interests in private business and trade. He recommends a comprehensive regulatory framework in order to curtail and regulate the work and influence of this section. However, we should recognise that in the process we may create another vested interest, namely, the bureaucracy. While the consequences of replacing completely one vested interest, private business, by another vested interest, bureaucracy, deserve to be carefully considered, this is not an immediate prospect. The immediate prospect is a much worse one, namely, that the two vested interests, private business and bureaucracy, may co-exist, join hands and undermine the entire regulatory apparatus. This may be the real danger in setting up an all-pervasive regulatory framework. Gadgil is probably justified in his criticism of the physical and the perspective planners who presumably believe that once a given capital investment is achieved, the economy functions automatically according to plan and leads to the development aimed at. So, as Gadgil emphasises, in order to succeed, a plan of investment must be supported by the necessary policy and regulatory framework. However, it will be equally wrong to suppose that a policy and a regulatory framework will function automatically merely because it is logical and comprehensive. To the extent that a regulatory framework curbs ordinary economic incentives, it will be necessary to create and provide other motivating incentives which, in the circumstances, have to be political and patriotic. Or else, we may have a frame without the motive power.||V. M. Dandekar

Yet between October 1964 and September 1966 the financial outlay on the power programme was cut twice without appropriately scaling down the physical targets of power generation and distribution-and that when costs have been rising continuously. This article discusses whether the outlay on the power programme proposed in the Draft Outline is adequate for achieving the physical targets of generation, transmission and distribution. An attempt is also made to examine whether the Draft Outline's targets for power are consistent with the expansion in industrial production planned for; in other words, whether the planned increase in generating capacity is adequate to meet the expected increase in demand.||T.

25/11/1967- ||special articles||24478341||The Governor and His Ministers||This examination of the position of the Governor in relation to the Council of Ministers leads to the conclusion that the constitutional position in regard to the situation in West Bengal is as follows: The Governor's power to prorogue or convene a session of the Legislature can be exercised only on the advice of the Council of Ministers. The only constitutional limitation regarding convening of a State Legislature is that six months shall not intervene between the last sitting in one session and the first sitting in the next. In West Bengal this would mean that the next sitting of the Assembly must be held before February 2, 1968. Fixing December 18 as the date for convening the next session of the Assembly is, therefore, quite proper since it is within the six months prescribed under Article 174 (1). The Governor can take no notice of statements made by any Members of the Legislature that they no longer support the Council of Ministers. There is only one constitutional method of indicating lack of support to the Government and that is by a vote in the Legislature. The view advanced by the Union Law Ministry about the Governor's power to dismiss the Ministry is clearly incorrect. The Governor has no such powers; only the President can dismiss the Ministry in a State when he takes action under Article 356 of the Constitution, and that too on the advice of the Prime Minister and his Council of Ministers.||S Mohan Kumaramangalam

It is, however, sad to think that such a resplendent figure has now become dim in our memory. More than half a century has gone by since her death, and yet no adequate steps have been taken on an all-India basis to perpetuate the memory of Sister Nivedita in a befitting manner. It is to be hoped, therefore, that her birth centenary, which falls on this October 28, will provide an opportunity for making a fresh evaluation of her many-sided contributions to the uplift of Indian life and culture.||Moni Bagchee

The lower, projection of the excess presumes that recent trends in production will continue, and the upper projection that all current expansion programmes will be fulfilled. For India these assumptions are particularly dubious. While the trend rate of growth indicated a production in 1965-66 of 367 thousand tonnes, actual production was 2 thousand tonnes lower. Factors responsible for the decline in the trend were largely drought, the threat of border hostilities, and failure to secure and use external credit. Any projection based on the fulfillment of expansion programmes under the Fourth Plan also appears unrealistic. The required increase in yield per hectare and extension of area under tea both seem unlikely considering the performance of similar schemes under the Third Plan and the fact that private tea producers, who have a major share in tea production, are not in tune with the Plan targets. The Interim Report's forecasts for tea production in Ceylon and Kenya are similarly optimistic. And its estimate of growth in consumption by 1970 is very modest as it fails to take into account the suppressed demand in developing countries like India.||Himansu Roy

With each subsequent Plan the official deadline for self-reliance has been pushed forward by two Plan-periods. In fact, the trade and payments gap has been continually widening and dependence on external assistance has become increasingly complete, taking the country to the point where it has to borrow to service past debt. At the same time, facts show that over the Plan periods the extent of use of foreign loans has been inversely linked with the rate of growth achieved.||Krishna Nath Sharma

The improvements suggested here are grouped under four heads: comprehensive planning, efficiency analysis of expenditure, the budgetary frame work and account of the reporting systems. It is, of course, conceded that it is easier to draw up a scheme than to implement it. Implementation comes up against long-established interests and traditional modes of thinking and action. It also has to overcome practical difficulties such as shortage of personnel. These problems require to be identified and appropriately tackled.||A. Premchand

The data analysed are for a sample of 257 manufacturing companies which account for 60 per cent of the paid-up capital of public manufacturing companies, excluding iron and steel and power companies, in the private sector. A comparative study of the performance of business houses classified by size shows that the top seven houses paid lower tax and made higher profits; their capital turnover was, however, lower than that of other Indian houses. Rapid expansion of investment in fixed assets enabled them to lower their effective tax and to increase their profits after tax though their profits before tax were comparatively low. By comparison middle order houses and other Indian houses expanded their sales more than their fixed assets as compared to the biggest houses. As a result they benefited to a lesser extent from tax concessions, paid higher tax and made lower profits. Taking the sample as a whole, the foreign-controlled international combines paid the highest tax, had the highest profitability and also high capital turnover.||V D Lall

An attempt is made here to estimate the extent of tax saving by companies through the Development Rebate. The estimate is based on data collected from the profit and loss accounts of 257 public manufacturing companies in the private sector for the period 1956 to 1965. During this period for the companies studied, Development Rebate averaged about 9 per cent of profits before tax. At this level, in effect, the Development Rebate conferred a tax saving equal to nearly 5 per cent of profits before tax and 10 per cent of tax liability. [This paper is based on a study of company taxation and finance entitled "Shifting of Company Taxation - An Economic Analysis", a doctoral dissertation to be submitted shortly at the University of Bombay.]||V.

1/7/1967- ||special articles||24478192||Voting Pattern in the Fourth General Election—III: Congress Gains from a Divided Opposition in Haryana||In the 1967 elections, Haryana was one of the very few States where Congress was able to improve its position. In both the Vidhan Sabha and Parliament, Congress's share of the votes polled and seats won went up. The Jan Sangh emerged as the main rival to the Congress; and next to it Independents gained the most. The group of Left parties contested a larger number of seats than in 1962, but polled fewer votes and failed to win any seat. Analysis by districts reveals that, where the Congress lost it had been ridden with acute factionalism. Congress candidates who might have won had been refused tickets and they had stood and won as Independents. Also, the minority Muslim vote had gone against the Congress. A divided opposition failed to cash in on factionalism within the Congress. Evidence shows that a combined opposition front could have made all the difference; at the least it could have won the 13 seats which the Congress won with less than 40 per cent of the votes. Congress gains in 1967 are no indication, however, of Congress fortunes in Haryana in the future. The author feels that in Haryana the individual politician, rather than political parties, attracts the vote. Parties seek individuals who they think can win elections. Now that the Congress is no more the party in power, Congressmen have started to move out of it.||R K Sharma

The cotton textile industry is a major foreign exchange earner and is one of the industries from which a substantial stepping up of exports is expected in the Fourth Plan. The purpose of the analysis is to identify and measure the relative importance of the different factors limiting the competitiveness of the industry. The examination of costs shows that the major factors underlying the lack of competitiveness of some of India's textile exports are external to the firm. It follows that the remedies too are beyond the control of the firm.||S. Paul,V. L. Mote

The authors' purpose is to explore and present facts relating to a small but qualitatively important part of the corporate sector. The data presented here reveal that most of of the pharmaceutical manufacturing business in Maharashtra is under foreign control, mainly American, British and Swiss. In 1964 the wholly foreign owned companies were earning a cash profit (profit after tax but before depreciation) which would bring their investment back within two years.

In her study of social mobility, the author, following Weber, considers the three axes of social stratification-status, class and power-and the avenues of mobility considered relevant to each axis. She also tries to examine the relative weight attached to each, though a precise evaluation is a difficult, if not impossible, task. [The author is indebted to the people in the Potters' Camp at the Convention for their help and hospitality, especially to Shri Gordhan without whose help the field work would not have been possible.]||Veena Monga

In the first two parts of the article, which appeared on November 18 and 25, the authors examined the general socio-economic background against which gheraos developed in West Bengal, the occurrence of gheraos in different industries and trades and their effectiveness as judged by the manner of their resolution. This, the third part, is concerned with the extent of trade union involvement in gheraos and with inter-union rivalry and aggressive employer response as factors contributing to gheraos. Also examined is the relative abstinence of white-collar workers from gheraos.||Nitish R De,Suresh Srivastava

Considering the importance of these ties it is to be hoped that no further time will be lost in restoring them to steady expansion. Before this can be done, however, a close examination of the real benefits of trade with the socialist bloc and the special problems that it gives rise to is called for. An attempt is made here to examine some of these problems, particularly to throw some light on whether the remarkable growth of exports to the socialist countries has been achieved at the expense of exports to the rest of the world.||J A Rosario

The average farmer, it feels, is reconciled to the prospect of enhancement of land revenue in the context of the substantial expansion of irrigation facilities in the last few years. The Opposition parties have claimed that the farmer is in no position to bear the additional fiscal burden but, significantly, there has been hardly any protest from the farmers themselves.||C V H Rao

A less obvious limitation is that no balance of payment surplus can be built up beyond the balance of payment deficits of other countries. The thinking of this paper is based on the contention that the short-term engagements of a country should be limited not by its stock of gold nor by its ability to proportion its gold among contenders, but only by its ability to honour these short-term engagements with goods and services. Present conditions prevent the United States from making short-term engagements to the full extent of its economic potential. They also prevent the developing countries from assuming longterm obligations to the full extent of their potential to produce. This impasse would be lifted if these countries could pay not according to their potential for earning hard currencies, but according to their ability to deliver useful goods in future. Our present monetary systems provide the technical possibility of accumulating unspent savings, but the world's economy can honour savings with nothing other than goods or services. As a consequence, multiple step exchanges which may cause accumulation of unspent savings do not come into being. The chain of trade which would have benefited all parties is broken; it would have included a party accumulating money in excess of what it is going to spend, leaving at the other end of the chain a party with unsold commodities. Savings held as claims to future commodities, money defined by commodities on call, could complete this chain of trade. Future basic commodities could be held as a vehicle of savings if forward trade of these commodities, many years ahead, could be organised so that the forward sold commodities could be resold like stocks and bonds are sold at present. This article presents a proposal to this effect and describes the ways in which present ability to produce could be made a source of liquidity through commodity currency backed by the promise of producers of basic commodities to honour this currency.||Joseph C Frommer

The Arab States, however, have never recognised the State of Israel, and the Arab refusal to recognise the problem of rehabilitating the Palestinian Arab refugees elsewhere is part of this attitude. The big powers have hitherto attempted to keep their own kind of balance in West Asia by supplying the rival States with military hardware. And every 10 years, through the outbreak of hostilities, the very existence of Israel is challenged by the Arabs, and each time Israelis have to make an effective show of their strength. Yet this is no long-term solution. The impasse will be a permanent threat to world peace unless the Arabs now recognise that Israel is here to stay, and unless the Israelis who are surrounded by the Arabs are imaginative and generous in their dealings with the Arabs. That will be a slow but lasting solution, and a heavy responsibility rests on the big powers if they really wish to preserve peace in West Asia and not use the situation to their own political and economic ends.||Sankar N.

30/9/1967- ||special articles||41626876||Social Security Legislation in India—I: The Employees' Provident Fund Scheme||The Employees' Provident Fund Act and Employees' State Insurance Act constitute the core of social security legislation in India. Examination of the working of these two schemes leaves no doubt that the concept of social security has been in practice narrowed to the point of absurdity. First, the coverage of the schemes is microscopic. They are applicable to one-half of one per cent of the population and one per cent of the labour force. They do not touch the most vulnerable section of the labour force, agricultural labour. Among the rest, the schemes have mostly benefited the better organised wage earners and middle-class salary earners. Second, social security in its essence implies income security, but neither of these schemes were intended to safeguard even the small proportion of the labour force that they cover in this essential respect. In fact, the term social security is too presumptuous to describe what they attempt. Finally, the idea of social security implies centralisation of authority in a single institution capable of controlling the operation of social security schemes throughout the country. But in India the Government acts merely as an administrative authority and continues to be unable to use its coercive authority to compel recalcitrant employers to fulfil their obligations. In this, the first part of her article, the author critically examines the working of the Employees' Provident Fund scheme; an evaluation of the Employees' State Insurance scheme will follow in the second, and concluding, part next week.||Manorama G Savur

28/10/1967- ||special articles||24478850||Growing Irrelevance of Economics in Planning: Case of Procurement Prices||The procurement prices for paddy for the 1967-68 kharif season announced by the Government of India are higher than (i) procurement prices at the beginning of 1966-67 by 14 to 17 per cent; and, (ii) procurement prices as recommended by the Agricultural Prices Commission by 12 to 15 per cent. The decision to fix procurement prices so high makes complete nonsense of the policy of a balanced and integrated price structure. It is fallacious to argue that in the present economic context what is needed to stimulate production are high prices. When the supply of critical inputs necessary for agricultural production is so inelastic, higher prices can only mean higher factor prices leading to a cost-price spiral. The higher prices fixed for foodgrains would make the demand for higher prices for commercial crops irresistible. The consequence of this merry-go-round of high and higher prices of agricultural commodities would be disastrous for our exports.||M L Dantwala
1/8/1967- ||the political watershed||24477856||Coalition and Congress||What we are witnessing in India today is polarisation, beyond what had existed during the freedom struggle and afterwards. The rumblings and the crises are the product of the end of four decades and more of what one may call the undivided hegemony of the national bourgeoisie. And this is paralleled by the process of growing objective differentiation within this class with the emergence of clearly defined oligopolistic houses of industry and high finance. But there is as yet no firm realignment around a new core, not even around a coalition as a core. It seems, however, clear that what will replace the Congress for some years to come will be a coalition of equals in which the leadership itself will be a coalition. But it will be a coalition with coherence, a replica at a higher level of what the centrist Gandhi-Nehru leadership was for four decades. And it will be a coalition which will be to the left of the one India has been dominated by up to now. Such a coalition is yet to be, though some of its prefigurations have already arrived.||Mohit Sen

The results of this study, based on data for six villages in UP and Punjab, controvert the finding of the Farm Management Studies that gross output per acre declines with increase in size of holding. It is seen here that once current fallow is excluded in determining size of holding and there are no differences in the proportion of area irrigated, gross output per acre is constant for all sizegroups of holidings.||A P Rao

In this, the concluding part of the article, is examined the structure of authority in the Congress party as it becomes manifest from the process of selection of candidates.

The National Conference functions in both the regions of the State, but it is better organised in the Valley. And it is in the Valley where politics has been transformed more radically by election activity. Popular resentment against years of misrule, which earlier found outlet in occasional secessionist outbursts, has for the first time got an effective constitutional outlet in the challenge to the Government which Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed has posed. This healthy development, however, received a severe jolt with the rejection of nomination papers of 118 opposition candidates in 39 constituencies resulting in the unopposed return of 22 Congress candidates.||Balraj Puri

To avoid the delays which marked the publication of the 1961 Census tables, a stricter scrutiny of priorities is called for in preparing for the next Census. The 1971 Census should dispense with projects like village and handicraft surveys and reports on fairs and festivals. There is also a case for giving up the current practice of preparing a general report on the census results for each State. Among the areas which should receive high priority in the 1971 Census are studies of urbanisation, migration and fertility.||Pravin M Visaria

On the other hand, we continue to import huge quantities under PL 480. It is important, therefore, to ensure that PL 480 supplies are imported and transported to the consumer as economically as possible. Towards this end, an attempt is made here to examine the efficiency of the present pattern of import of wheat, which is the single largest item in PL 480 imports, in order to arrive at a more efficient alternative pattern of purchase and distribution. There are three points at which economies can be effected. There could be a choice between Western White wheat and Hard Red winter wheat which is more expensive; a choice between shipping the supplies from the Pacific Northwest coast from which ocean transports to Indian coasts are cheaper and from the Gulf coast; and a choice between alternative routings to meet consumer demand within India of the imported supplies. However, choice between the two types of wheat is virtually non-existent because though cheaper, Western White wheat is largely exported on a commercial basis and only the balance is exported under PL 480 - the cheapness of the wheat reflecting not its easy availability but the support price policy of the US Government. The choice between shipping from the Gulf coast or the Northwest Pacific coast would have to take account of overland transportation of the wheat from the surplus States in the U S to the Pacific coast. The cost of overland transport would, however, practically wipe off the difference between ocean transportation rates from the Pacific coast and the Gulf coast. The third choice is a genuine economic choice. A linear programming analysis shows that a much better routing of the imports to the different Indian ports is possible. [The author is grateful to N C Khandekar for assistance in evaluating the programming model on which the analysis presented below is based.]||K. Sundaram

1/2/1967- ||focus on development||4357568||The Alloy Steels Industry: Making up for past Neglect||Among the factors responsible for holding back industrial development in the country, the failure to establish the alloy steel industry early enough must be rated as one of the most important. Only in 1958, 11 years after Independence, did the Government finally decide to set up the first alloy steel plant. Even then bureaucratic procedures prevented plans from being speedily implemented and two valuable years were lost between July 1960, when the consultants submitted their detailed project report for Hindustan Steel's alloy steel plant at Durgapur, and June 1962 when global tenders for equipment for the project were invited. As a result of the long neglect of the alloy steels industry the country has so far had to depend almost entirely on imports. This has not only entailed a heavy drain of foreign exchange but also starved the engineering industry of a critical raw material. Happily, in spite of initial setbacks, Hindustan Steel's alloy steel plant has made rapid progress. A number of other projects both in the public and private sectors are also under way and by the end of the Fourth Plan the gap between demand for and production of alloy steels is expected to be bridged to a great extent. We have a reasonable raw material base for the alloy steels industry. A start has been made in manufacturing the necessary ferro-alloys, but considerable more work needs to be done in identifying new deposits and setting up plants for the full range of ferro-alloys and operating supplies. Indian engineering and knowhow in the alloy steel industry is also well developed and this should greatly facilitate the rapid expansion of the industry. Unfortunately, there is still a tendency to depend too much on foreign collaboration and turn-key deals, as is evident from the large number of collaboration agreements entered into or being negotiated for alloy steel plants. No country, least of all India, can be or need be self-sufficient in technology or equipment, but the purchase of technology is rendered ineffective, and also exorbitantly expensive, if there is proliferation of collaboration agreements. Purchase of technology has to be selective, according to a well defined plan and not on an ad hoc basis as has happened in the past. Also, import of technology has to be so channelled that knowhow once acquired can be effectively utilised for a number of similar projects. In this respect the development of the alloy steels industry presents both a challenge and an opportunity.||M. N. Dastur

23/9/1967- ||special articles||24478253||Planning and Growth in India||Three things, it is argued here, have gone wrong with Indian planning. First, the role of deficit financing for resources mobilisation has been over-emphasised. This has led to inflationary trends and, consequently, to a rise in the ratio of inventory to investment which has been a drag on development. Second, in the analysis of the relationship between rate of growth and choice of technique, the non-basic goods sectors' role as a generator of employment has been entirely neglected. This has resulted in an increase in the backlog of unemployment from 5 million in 1955-56 to the staggering figure of 10 million in 1965-66. Finally, in the context of determining the sectoral flow of resources, the distinction between basic consumption and non-basic consumption has not been appreciated.||Pradhan Harishankar Prasad

28/10/1967- ||special articles||24478852||Farm People in a Rapidly Changing World||This paper discusses the situation in which farm people find themselves today and the problems that they are likely to face in the next few decades in a rapidly changing world. Attention is drawn particularly to two sets of external factors inducing rapid change: demographic pressures and scientific progress. Even with the maximum success in control of fertility, the numbers of young people coming of working age will increase greatly in most underdeveloped countries during the next 15 years. This will raise problems not only of absorbing large numbers in agriculture but also of moving increasing proportions into non-farm employment. The solution of these problems will demand, among other things, large investment of resources for relocation of economic activity and of labour and for education and occupational training. The implied transformation of simple societies of primary producers into complex industrial societies will call for revolutionary changes in the techniques of agricultural production and the structure and attitudes of agricultural societies. The possible route and pace of these changes have to be considered against the background of demographic movements.||D R Gadgil

During the early phases of economic growth, inter-sectoral inequality and sectoral shifts in weights of sectors are most influential unless there is a major shake-up of institutions intra-sectorally. In other words, barring radical changes in institutions, inequality in income distribution must inevitably increase as a consequence of industrialisation. In this article the author expects to establish that (1) the structural changes in the distribution of income by industrial origin are intimately connected with the shifts in size distribution; and, (2) the overall size distribution of income has little value unless it is examined along with the components of this distribution. Quantitatively, it is contended, 85 per cent of the changes in the size distribution of income in India have been due to structural shifts resulting from industrialisation and not from changes in size distribution within sectors.

First, the evidence is not conclusive on the movement of disparity in the distribution of personal income by size reckoned at current prices, but the overwhelming indication is that there has been some increase in disparity after 1951-54 and also towards the end of the period chosen for study. Second, there has been a marked increase in disparity in distribution of personal income by size reckoned in real terms throughout the period. Taken together with the fact that per capita real consumption expenditure rose very slowly, this is indicative of stability or even deterioration of the level of living of the poorer sections of the population.||M Mukherjee,G S Chatterjee

9/12/1967- ||special articles||24478285||Problems of Gestation: Investment in Public Sector Projects||An analysis of the factors responsible for unduly long gestation lags in public sector projects reveals that most of the delays are avoidable with proper planning and co-ordination and quick decision-making by the agencies concerned with the projects. The longest delays in fact occur at the initial decision-making stage. So to under-estimate the importance of this stage of a project is to ignore the importance of decision-lags in lengthening the gestation period of investment in general. Inefficient project planning is another factor responsible for delaying public sector projects. It is suggested here that project designing and evaluating institutes should be set up for different sectors of the economy which would design projects in much larger number than can be taken up in the next few years and evaluate their costs and benefits and prepare execution schedules for them. There should be specialised institutions also to keep watch over project implementation and to identify in advance bottlenecks which are likely to cause delays.||S R K Rao

An attempt is made here to examine the relative importance of the three factors in the current economic situation in the country.||J D Sethi

11/3/1967- ||special articles||4357687||A Swing to the Left||Two significant aspects of the Congress debacle in the election need to be noted. First, while the country has moved to the Left, the composition of the Congress power structure has changed in favour of the Right. The Left in the Congress has been left practically without a spokesman in Parliament. And the Congressmen from Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Mysore, U P, Bihar, etc returned to the Lok Sabha are more to the Right than their predecessors in the third Lok Sabha. Second, centrist forces in the Congress have suffered severe losses. The defat of Kamaraj is symbolic of this development. The question remains, however, how far the election results can be said to represent a swing to the Left.||Mohit Sen

This article examines the view, now put forward as unconventional but in fact quite conventional, that a strategy of development which concentrates investment in consumer goods industries rather than in capital goods industries would yield not only a faster rate of growth but also a larger expansion of employment and an easier balance on the external account. The argument has its attractions, but it rests on certain assumptions about capital-output and capital-labour ratios in consumer goods and capital goods industries and about the income elasticity of international demand for the consumer goods exports of developing countries. These assumptions ought to be more closely examined than they are by the protagonists of the consumption oriented strategy of development.||D R Khatkhate

Under the agreement which has just been concluded, Ashlands are to provide not just technical know-how or foreign exchange but even management for the project. In fact for the exploitation of the Agnigundala reserves we need nothing from outside the country — neither equipment nor technical know-how. Everything needed is being made in India by engineering establishments which are crying out for orders to enable them to utilise their installed capacity. This seems, then, a fit case for Parliament to take note of before it is too late to take remedial measures.||K V Subrahmanyam

Actually, the Government was able to purchase only about eight per cent of that surplus on average over the 16year period studied by Raj Krishna. Yet Raj Krishna nowhere examines why the ratio of government purchases to output of foodgrains has almost continuously declined over the years. Such an examination is absolutely necessary. For, if it is found that the factors which have led to the progressive decline of the ratio of government purchases to output have become more rather than less important, then to suggest a course of action which calls for a sharp rise in this ratio without simultaneously suggesting ways of overcoming the factors responsible for its decline in the past cannot but be treated as an exercise in imaginary solution of a real problem.||Daya Krishna

04/3/1967- ||special articles||4357664||Foreign Exchange Bottlenecks: Or Unwillingness to Save?||The concept of 'foreign exchange bottlenecks' externalises the difficulties of the developing countries. It creates the impression that growth in these countries is hindered by the lack of foreign exchange finance. However, a closer examination of the assumptions of this view shows that in most cases a foreign exchange bottleneck can be traced to an unwillingness to save within the economy. And the externalising of that unwillingness assumes certain value judgments about the tolerable cuts in internal consumption. Before we strike postures towards aid-givers on the basis of the value judgments implied in such a concept, therefore, it is necessary that we have an objective and detailed analysis of whether we can overcome this 'foreign exchange' bottleneck by internal measures, and of the price we will pay in terms of alternative domestic objectives by adopting such measures.||Vijay Joshi

1/2/1967- ||focus on development||4357556||Coastal Andhra: Towards an Affluent Society||I came back to Andhra in August 1966 for the first time since 1959. The purpose of my journey was to see how the coastal region of Andhra contrasted with the shortage areas in which I had just been travelling, namely, northern Bihar, lower Bengal and inland Orissa. About these regions where some people were eating only two meals a day and a few-but only a few-were getting only one proper meal a day, I shall be writing subsequently. As contrasted with the pockets of distress in eastern India, I found coastal Andhra to be a completely different world. Practically everyone had the equivalent of two-and-a-half to three meals a day. This was true even in non-irrigated villages, though in these the meals of the poorest villagers might be dull and repetitious-ragi gruel and ragi porridge alternating with ragi porridge and ragi gruel. Best off were the delta districts, such as East and West Godavari. There even the familis of agricultural labourers who were utterly landless earned enough to eat three rice meals per day, supplemented by vegetables, spices, chillies, occasionally dry fish and tea, coffee or toddy. Compared with the rest of India, this was, in relative terms, an affluent area. The deltas abounded in signs of change, development, progress. It was no accident that when, later in the year, old fashioned and obscurantist elements in northern India rioted against cow-slaughter, coastal Andhra demonstrated in force for a new steel mill.||Daniel Thorner
1/2/1967- ||focus on development||4357561||An Over-Consistent Plan||The Perspective Planning Division's "Draft Fourth Plan-Material and Financial Balances, 1964-65, 1970-71, 1975-76", gives the quantitative assumptions and quantitative end-products of a large number of calculations but does not provide the justifications for the assumptions or explain the methods used in the calculations. What the document does is not to lay bare the underlying logic of the Plan, but to demonstrate that the targets of the Plan are, subject to a number of unstated technological and economical assumptions, mutually consistent. Of course, this itself is an extremely important achievement. On looking closer, however, one starts to have many doubts. One even wonders whether the consistency is not achieved with the help of assumptions which are not only unstated but also arbitrary. The process of plan formulation in this country is largely a bureaucratic activity in which participate the various Working Groups of the Planning Commission as well as the different Ministries and Departments. It is nowhere explained how the work of the different official organisations is so co-ordinated that the targets set substantially independently to start with become in the end more or less consistent. Instead of clearing up this mystery, the "Material and Financial Balances" creates a more intriguing one, the mystery of what the author calls "over-consistency"-that is, a degree of consistency not to be expected in the circumstances or even logically possible.||Ashok Rudra

16/12/1967- ||special articles||24478967||Gheraos in West Bengal—IV: A Study in Industrial Conflict||In the first three parts of this article (November 18 and 25 and December 2) the authors examined the general socio-economic background against which the gherao movement developed in West Bengal, the occurrence of gheraos in different industries and trades, the extent of trade union involvement, the role of inter-union rivalry and aggressive employer response in heightening tension, and the effectiveness of gheraos as judged by the manner of their resolution. In this, the concluding part, the authors consider the basic labour and management attitudes which were reflected in the gherao movement. Most relevant to the issue is the deep frustration of workers with the pattern of industrial relations that has evolved over the last two decades. The statutory and non-statutory machinery set up by Government for regulating industrial relations has failed if not on any other count on that of the colossal delay it entails. And at the enterprise level, management attitudes do not permit worker participation in decision-making and implementation in any meaningful sense. In its anxiety to move away from this pattern of industrial relations, the United Front Government in West Bengal gave its blessing to what turned out in effect to be a laissez faire situation from which workers could derive no particular advantage. The legal system and the fact that the gherao movement was confined to West Bengal left employers with a choice of policies to defeat it. What both the trade unions and the State Government failed to give any thought to was the opportunity presented by the coming to power of the United Front Government to use the State apparatus to influence management and labour attitudes in the direction of a solution-oriented approach to industrial relations.||Nitish R De,Suresh Srivastava

One of the more serious obstacles to efficient planning by the firm is uncertainty about economic policy, particularly taxation policy. There is, therefore, an urgent need to avoid drastic and erratic changes in the tax structure. Further, the various concessions which have been given with a view to selectively softening the impact of high tax rates have inevitably made our tax system a very complicated one. It needs to be examined whether there is not a strong case for simplifying the system by removing the various concessions and simultaneously bringing down the tax rates.||Mahesh Bhatt

On the other hand, following the recommendations of the Fourth Finance Commission, Gujarat is no longer entitled to grants-in-aid from the Centre. How will the State meet the financial needs of the Fourth Plan? Some areas in which a renewed tax effort can yield returns are indicated here. It is also suggested that the State's resources position may not be as tight as would seem from the Budget for 1967-68 because in the past State budgets have consistently underestimated revenue receipts. At the same time capital expenditure, which draws on the revenue surplus, has never reached the budgeted figures.||Mahesh Bhatt,C. H. Thaker
25/2/1967- ||special articles||4357638||Future of the Planning Commission||It is a measure of the decline of the Planning Commission that nobody in the country, the Government included, has taken the Fourth Plan seriously. The outlay in the first year of the Plan and that proposed for the second year have had very little to do with the programmes included in the Plan; the rate and pattern of licensing of industries even less. Doubts have been raised about the feasibility of the Plan and even the technical consistency of its targets has been questioned. Admittedly, the last three years have not been good-for the Planning Commission or for the country. The Planning Commission has lost in Pandit Nehru the main force behind its prestige. The economy has had to face many extraneous difficulties-large-scale diversion of resources for military purposes, stoppage of aid and droughts. However, it is precisely in such a situation that planning assumes importance and the tragedy of the Fourth Plan is that the opportunity for presenting an economic programme to pull the economy out of the present rut has been missed. If this state of affairs is to be changed the new Government which takes over after the elections will need to address itself immediately to a thorough-going reform of the Planning Commission and of planning.||Arthagnani

17/6/1967- ||special articles||4358066||Shifting of Tax by Companies: Comments [with Reply]||V D Lall's article on "Shifting of Tax by Companies" ('Economic and Political Weekly', May 6, 1967) is an interesting pioneering effort in the field. An analysis of this kind in the field holds important policy implications because, apart from affecting equity, the shifting of tax influences relative prices of factors and commodities in the economy. However, is is argued below that V D Lall's conclusions are based on a sample that is not entirely representative and that his methodology is unacceptable, relying heavily as it does on linear correlations between two variables to draw major conclusions. One can, therefore, use his conclusions more as suggested hypotheses on the basis of which to do further research. To take an example; since 1959 both net profit after tax and dividends appear to be larger because in company accounts tax deducted at source on dividends is included in dividends and not in tax provisions. Lall's profitability ratios would thus have to be revised downwards. If other measures of profitability are similarly deflated, Lall's contention that increases in effective tax between 1956-60 and 1961-65 have been more than fully shifted, is seen to be not valid.||I.

Bank deposits have grown very much faster, however, compared to currency holdings. The question may still be asked whether bank deposits could have grown faster, and if so, what hindered their growth. In this article, which aims at provoking further discussion on the subject, an attempt is made to analyse and assess the leakages in the expansion of bank deposits. The general conclusion is that in the Indian economy the leakages are high. And, while the external payments deficit (which is mostly financed by external loans) and the inadequacy of banking facilities or lack of the banking habit do not pose a major long-term threat to deposit growth, inflation and unaccounted transactions will seriously impede the ability of the banking system to collect deposits and put them to better use.||V G Pendharkar

To test whether this has been in fact achieved, the author traces movements in the quantity and unit value of exports of 26 major commodities during June-December 1966. There is, however, no discernible pattern in the movements to support the view that devaluation has helped exports. While the prices of some goods had gone up, so had their exports, and for some other goods both prices and exports had fallen. Devaluation had no predictable effect on the price level in terms of foreign exchange.||J. A. Rosario

08/4/1967- ||special articles||4357790||Some Problems of Cross-Cultural Research||This discussion of problems of cross-cultural research is based on the author's surveys of factory labour in Poona. The first set of problems arise from the difficulties in the discovery and use of aggregative data. There has been a good deal of discussion of the differences in the definition of variables which mar their use for cross-national comparisons. Much less has been said about the inapplicability of the aggregate measures for micro studies. The required broad aggregate data that one needs are likely to be missing or, when present, of dubious accuracy in detail and collected in a fashion that maximises their utility at the macro level at the expense of the micro level. A second broad range of problems concerns the possible inapplicability to the non-Western setting of measurement techniques developed in the West. The final broad problem is a general methodological problem which has special, subtle implications for comparative research. Techniques of sociological analysis usually involves a statement of relationships between sets of variables, not individuals; that is to say, the attributes of an individual are generally treated as separable from the other attributes for purposes of analysis, even though we have ways of treating the effects of a composite set of variables on another composite set. The cross-cultural effect of this methodological gap is to obscure inter-cultural differences.||Richard D. Lambert

1/8/1967- ||external balance||24477867||Export Promotion after the Devaluation||How far has the Devaluation improved the competitive position of Indian exports? An attempt is made here to answer the question by computing the maximum reduction possible in the external prices of exports as a result of the Devaluation and comparing it with the maximum reduction which was possible with the export promotion measures which were in existence before the Devaluation and which were abolished along with the Devaluation. The answer which these computations give is that the competitive position of exports, other than those with an import content of less than 20 per cent, was better before than after the Devaluation. Further, though the competitive position of items with low import content can be said to have improved, these are possibly the items that did not need the support of the Devaluation. That this is a tenable surmise is indicated by the fact that the items on which it was considered necessary to impose export duties after the Devaluation were principally those with a minimum of import content, such as jute manufactures, tea and ores. To that extent, therefore, the Devaluation cannot take credit for improving the competitive position of commodities with a low import content. And since the competitive position of exports with import content of 20 per cent and over was better before than after the Devaluation, it is concluded here that the Devaluation has not improved the overall position of the country's exports. There is a strong case, therefore, for taking some additional measures now to improve the competitive position of exports for, after all, was not the Devaluation decided on because the pre-Devaluation incentives for exports were found to be inadequate?||I S Gulati

A Study of Bias in Futures Price Forecasts||Futures markets are time and again criticised for accentuating the rise in commodity prices. The critics assume that there is a definite upward bias in futures price forecasts as a result of which ready prices are constantly pushed up above the levels at which they would rule in the absence of futures trading. An attempt has been made in this article to assess the nature and extent of bias in futures price forecasts in the cotton, castorseeds, and groundnut futures markets of Bombay - the author also examines possible explanations for the downward bias in futures price forecasts. The author's data clearly show that in all the three commodities the bias in futures forecasts is in favour of lower prices. Thus futures markets do not aggravate upward trends in commodity prices; on the contrary, insofar as they tend to underestimate the prospective level of prices they exercise a restraining influence on price trends. [This article is based on the author's forthcoming monograph on "Accuracy of Price Movements by Commodity Futures Markets".]||M. G. Pavaskar
06/5/1967- ||special articles||4357905||Shifting of Tax by Companies||This paper attempts to show, on the basis of a study of a sample of 257 manufacturing companies in the private sector, that companies have not borne any of the increase in direct taxes during the twenty years, 1946 to 1965. In spite of the increase in taxation, they have been able to not only maintain but actually increase their profitability. In other words, they have succeeded in shifting the additional tax liability more than cent per cent. Analysis of the distribution of value of production and of value added establishes that dividends on share capital have increased as have the shares of interest and depreciation. Thus capital has not borne any part of the increase in taxation. The burden seems to have fallen largely on labour whose share in gross and net value added as also in value of production has declined. A part of the increase in taxation also seems to have been shifted to consumers. This is indicated by the fact that in the face of a decline in turnover of capital, the increase in profitability has been made possible by a higher profit margin on sales.||V. D. Lall

Countervailing obligations to civic virtue or public law have relatively little support in the traditional norms and institutions. To establish the idea of public obligations in this setting was a task of considerable proportions. The Gandhian norm for the conduct of public business translated the alien vision of a public ethic into a traditional idiom, dramatising, in the context of relations among family and friends, what British public law, administration and civic duty meant and required. By bringing the meaning of public obligation to those outside the small coterie of the English educated, Gandhi helped place the idea and practice of civility on a popular footing. While the norm which Gandhi established has often won rhetorical rather than behavioural adherence, it remains the most significant indigenous statement of civility.||Lloyd I Rudolph,Susanne Hoeber Rudolph

India already has a chronic balance of trade problem with the present Community; her exports continue to stagnate while her imports are still rising. And the loss of the preferences she enjoys at present in the UK market could precipitate a crisis. Of course, it would greatly improve India's trade prospects in the enlarged Common Market if a generalised preferential system could be created or the tariffs on primary and agricultural products, including tropical products, could be reduced or eliminated, perhaps as a result of the post-Kennedy Round talks to be held in Geneva this autumn. Unfortunately, it is not certain that either of these conditions will be met before Britain enters the EEC, probably in 1970. In the circumstances India should try to arrive at even a temporary arrangement with the Community during the course of the British negotiations. The Six can be expected to resist any such attempt on India's part; they will in all likelihood argue that it would be better to wait for the multilateral negotiations in the UNCTAD and GATT to end before holding bilateral talks. What is worse, given the importance of the British negotiations for the future of the Community, it is unlikely that Indian diplomacy will be able to successfully counter this argument.||

Underlying this confidence was the hope that Mannath Padmanabhan, the Nair leader, and the Christian Bishops, both of whom the Congress had managed to get on its side, would be able to significantly influence Nair and Christian votes. In the event this hope was sadly belied. On the other hand, if it was decided that secularist qualms were not to be allowed to stand in the way of election alliances, it would have paid the Congress a far richer dividend if it had tried to woo the Muslim League. This it failed to do, illogically in the name of secularism. It would also have significantly changed the results of the election if the Congress and the rebel Kerala Congress had forged an electoral arrangement. The Kerala Congress did offer to have such an arrangement, but the Congress rejected the offer insisting instead on the Kerala Congress merging with it. These wrong tactics have been largely responsible for the humiliating defeat which the Congress has suffered in Kerala at the hands of the United Left Front.||M. V. Pylee

Any plan for growth, therefore, needs to be clear about what savings are possible in the economy during various periods of development. It would thus need to know what the savings-income ratios are for the different sections and what factors affect the propensity to save. Only so can it determine what measures will be necessary to elicit the savings needed for the planned rate of growth, or what rate of growth is practical in the circumstances. This study aims to analyse the growth in the aggregate savings-income ratios, to discover the factors affecting it, and to project the sectoral and aggregate savings for 1970 and 1975. [This paper is an adaptation of Chapter 2 of my report, "Analysis and Projections of Trade Needs and Resource Requirements for India", which I wrote as a consultant to UNCTAD.

A larger flow of aid and foreign capital to the developing countries brings in its wake the problem of debt-servicing which, in turn, requires a sharp expansion of exports at some future date. But expansion of exports to the developed countries is not just a matter of vigorous export promotion by the developing countries or liberalisation of trade policies by the developed countries. It is necessary, therefore to, consider more radical solutions to enable the developing countries to meet their requirements of imports without depending on either exports to the developed countries or larger doses of aid. One such proposal is made here for linking debt servicing operations to expansion of trade among the developing countries.||D. R. Khatkhate

11/3/1967- ||special articles||4357689||Taxation and Personal Savings||Personal savings constitute the major part of savings in India. For this reason the thesis that direct taxes in India inhibit the growth of personal savings needs to be closely examined. What in fact is the combined effect of the income tax, the wealth tax and the expenditure tax on the personal savings of the wealthy? Is there a case for lowering the maximum rates of direct taxes on the rich in the interests of increasing savings for economic development? Further, is there a case for a statutory ceiling on the individual's direct tax liability?||Ved P. Gandhi
1/8/1967- ||new beginnings in planning||24477863||On Pricing in Public Enterprises||The 'no profit no loss' principle held such sway in the early stages of planning in India that public enterprises were run without any consideration for profit. But in the context of planning where one of the recognised sources of finance is profit from public enterprises, this was an untenable policy and there was pressure for its reversal. As always happens, the argument was turned the other way round and from 'no profit no loss' we have now moved to 'maximum profit'. What does this shift signify? The demand that public enterprises adopt a price policy which maximises profit may appear absurd. For, this amounts to asking the public sector to behave monopolistically and that, surely, is an anti-social demand. And yet there is an element of sense in this demand. The principle of competitive price fixing may maximise current income; it may not – and in the context of developing economies will not – yield the rate of growth that the economy may plan for. A larger surplus than competitive price-fixing would yield is, therefore, called for. One way out is to adopt a principle which makes price proportionate to but higher than cost in each line of industry, so that we fulfil the condition of maximum allocative efficiency and, at the same time, secure the surplus necessary for the desired rate of growth. But how much higher than cost? It is suggested in this article that in deciding how much higher we should use the concept of a shadow rate of interest, a rate of interest which is warranted by the degree of scarcity of capital in the economy.||A K Das Gupta

An attempt is made to quantify both the long and the short-run consequences to the Indian consumer. The Draft Outline's proposal is interpreted as an investment policy that steers a course intermediate between the two extremes of Scylla and Charybdis. Scylla would be an investment-oriented plan in which the long-run growth rate is maximised subject to the constraint that there be no immediate drop in the level of per capita consumption. Charybdis, on the other hand, would be a consumption-oriented plan corresponding to the most cautious view of financial resources-that the marginal savings and investment ratio must coincide with its initially given average value.||Alan S.

That being so, like other countries India has to base her foreign policy on her self-interest which today requires, above all, the achievement of a modus vivendi with China. Admittedly, an understanding with China will not be easy, but for that reason to proceed on the assumption that the Chinese will be actuated by eternal malice towards India can only lead to disastrous consequences. Friendship with Pakistan, too, is eminently desirable but it is less likely to come about than an understanding with China. On the positive side, India's foreign policy ought to pay particular attention to an area very close to her, the area of the Indian Ocean. Instead of having her eyes fixed on distant Moscow and Washington and taking the countries in this area for granted, an active policy towards them may yield rich results.||Sankar N. Maitra

First, neither the Congress nor the Jan Sangh, the two major parties in the State, has been able to extend its organisation or influence beyond its traditional strongholds. Unless these parties are able to build up a viable organisational base extending over the whole State, it will be difficult for either to provide stable political leadership in the States. Further, the recent defection of 36 party legislators, mostly from the Chhattisgarh area, is bound to make a deep dent in the support for the Congress in Mahakoshal, the one part of the State where the party has been traditionally strong. In the circumstances, it is unlikely that the Congress will recover its dominant position in the State unless it makes up with the feudal elements. Second, Madhya Pradesh politics has always been dominated by feudal elements and the exprincely houses, but given the inability of political parties like the Congress and the Jan Sangh to build up a political base for themselves in the State, these elements are becoming more conscious of their power and more organised in their use of it. It is likely, therefore, that they will claim a greater share in the exercise of political power in the State. Finally, an interesting fact which an attempt to correlate social and economic developments in Madhya Pradesh with the growth of support for different political parties brings out is that the modernising forces have tended to tilt the balance of electoral support actually in favour of Rightist parties rather than in favour of either the Congress or the Left parties.||R Chandidas

2/12/1967- ||special articles||24478481||The Sources of Technological Growth||The sequence from invention to innovation involves several closely inter-dependent activities ranging from basic research, applied research, development, design and engineering of prototype or pilot plant, production and marketing to sales and after-sales service. But in the developing countries it is the latter part of the chain—what may be called design, development and engineering (D, D & E) — that is of crucial importance for technological growth. In India this important point has not been grasped so far, mainly because our 'science and technology' budget has never been broken down into its basic, applied and developmental research components. It follows that for innovation to become the motor of progress an increasing number of personnel trained in science and technology have to make their careers not in 'research' but in planning, management, production, marketing and sales. At the level of planning decisions, an area where economists have been far less sure of themselves is that of determining the mix of options in a given technology, especially when the international pool of know-how is subject to rapid change and the outputs are highly heterogeneous in terms of degree of processing, cost and quality. But getting down to such policy-oriented analysis cannot be put off indefinitely.||Ashok Parthasarathi

A villager's status in his jati and through his jati in the village community depends in considerable part on the kin whom he can mobilise as allies and supporters. A man can know no closer and more firmly bound allies than his sons. That is why so great a proportion of villagemen, when asked by a touring pollster about how many children they would like to have, gave the answer three. This seems promising enough for population planning measures until it is realised that what the villager means is that a man should have at least three living adult sons. Just as one main meaning of kinship relations has to do with power and status, so does the villager's quest for power and status have significant meaning for India's population growth.||David G.

1/2/1967- ||perspective on the general election||4357549||Party Politics and Political Development||The political system that has been developed in India is a fascinating and impressive one and has so far shown considerable reserves of strength. However, the system is also undergoing profound changes in its operation and is pressed by a growing number of problems. It would be foolhardy to predict the future performance of the system, however capable it may have proved in the past. The coming General Election may show us the precise extent to which the structure of support and mobilisation built on the political surface has percolated downwards in terms of a stable and institutionalised pattern of loyalties and identities. It will also show the extent to which expectations from the leadership are held in check or are running amuck. It is the balance or imbalance between these two aspects which will make it possible to indicate with greater confidence the future scope of the political system as well as the further changes in the patterns of dominance and opposition which are discussed in this article. What does seem clear is that the system has proved capable of handling the basic problem of the transformation of a traditional order without disproportionate social cost. Given another 15 to 20 years, both the stability of the system and its viability will be assured. Gaining this time for the system is not asking too much, nor is it such an insuperable task provided some of the urgent steps discussed below are attended to. The new leadership which will take over after the election will have, to begin with, five years in which to act. This may be a short period, but not too short a one.||Rajni Kothari
