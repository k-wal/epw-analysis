19/5/1984-26/5/1984||special articles||4373279||Aspects of India's Development Strategy for 1980s||It remains a puzzle that higher rates of savings have not resulted in higher rates of growth of the Indian economy. While it may be true that the capital-output ratio has risen on the margin, it is not clear what the factors are which have contributed to this process on an economy-wide basis. Moreover, the growth rate viewed as a product of the marginal capital-output ratio and the savings ratio is at best an equilibrium relationship and often little more than an accounting framework. In either case, it does not tell a causal story. Is it possible to argue that the rise in the capital-output ratio has something to do with the operation of demand factors in our development process? Normally, such a question would be answered in the negative. Common wisdom has been that a rise in the capital-output ratio is a sign of increased inefficiency of resource utilisation. But this is only a part of the story; there are some economy-wide processes which cannot be ignored and which are at least in part connected with demand factors.||Sukhamoy Chakravarty

1/8/1984- ||structural change||4373484||Industrial Structure, Non-Price Competition and Industrial Development||The neo-classical economic theory addressed itself mainly to the problem of administering existing structures, including the industrial structure. The variables it considerered were mostly price variables On the other hand, to Schumpeter, the problem was not one of the administering existing structures, but of the creation and destruction of the structures. Growth and development implied changes in structures, and the variable that influenced structural change, and through it industrial growth and development, were by and large non-price variables. The objective of this paper is to examine the relevance of non-price variables in explaining Indian industrial performance and to draw certain implications for industrial policy. Section II discusses the relevant portions of Schumpeterian theory on technological change, industrial structure and industrial development. It analyses the influence of industrial structure and conduct of firms on industrial perfromance and formulates a statistically testable hypothesis. Section III examines the empirical evidence for India in support of the hypothesis and Section IV draws the policy implications.||N. S. Siddharthan
07/4/1984- ||special articles||4373136||Post-War Growth in World Trade in Manufactures||An attempt has been made in this paper to understand the factors that sustained the remarkable growth of world trade in manufactures in the post-Second World War period upto the early seventies. The author argues that the multilateral tariff reductions carried out under the GATT system were not the major factor in stimulating growth of world trade in manufactures. Other important processes were at work in the international economy, especially in the international capitalist economy, comprising advanced industrialised countries as well as the developing countries. Growth of international capital markets and capital movements or factor mobility were a major source of growth of world trade in manufactures. Declining transport costs or transactions costs which reduced the costs of transport of goods over 'time' and 'space' were as significant as, if not more significant than, tariff reductions in stimulating world trade. Finally, increased productivity gains in export industries through accumulation and technology diffusion and the operations of transnationals imparted a trade-promoting bias to the world economy.||Vijay L.

31/3/1984- ||review of agriculture, march 1984||4373107||Distribution of Agricultural Assets in Punjab: Some Aspects of Inequality||Concurrent with fast agricultural development, Punjab also witnessed a hitherto unprecedented growth of capital stock in agriculture and the emergence of markets in the hiring of these assets. It is not always recognised that inequality in ownership of assets has some special implications. There is a marked difference in the conditions under which the owners and the hirers of assets have access to their services. Another source of inequality, on which asset ownership has an important impact, is vulnerability to deprivation in a bad agricultural year. These two aspects of asset ownership have an important impact on unequal access to goods and services. This study looks into the degree of inequality in the ownership of different kinds of assets in the Punjab at a point of time in the late Seventies. This inequality is the consequence of differences in saving or in access to credit, the two sources of finance for asset creation. Putting together the evidence on these two aspects the author arrives at some far reaching conclusions with regard to the nature of asset creation in the agricultural sector in the Punjab.||Kanchan Chopra

A satisfactory framework for studying the rural labour market must at least recognise the basic distinction between attached and casual labour and of the interactions between them. Such a framework is essential for a better understanding of the processes of the rural labour market leading to determination of wage rates and intensities of employment. In general rural labour market studies have neglected attached labour. Wage rate determination in particular has been studied mainly in reference to casual labour. An attempt is made here to highlight some of the interactions between the casual and attached labour categories through the comparison of their wage rates.||Rakesh Basant

The State balanced the two exploiting classes of tribal chiefs and farmer-traders. The bureaucracy functioned as a ruling class. Power was exercised through legitimation, bureaucratic organisation, coercion, and immorality. In so far as a rational bureaucratic organisation was present, Weber's model - according to which rationality and bureaucracy arose in modern capitalist society - stands questioned. It is suggested that the state in contemporary, ex-colonial, underdeveloped countries may also often be autonomised, with the military and civil bureaucracy functioning as a ruling class.||Satya Deva

The policy of financial institutions and banks providing resources by way of loans even when the risk capital at stake is meagre is wrong. If the provision of risk capital is adequate to start with, it automatically enables an industrial unit to obtain loans or additional funds when the business gets exposed to hazards associated with the running of industrial ventures. Under the present fiscal dispensation difficulties in securing risk capital are, however, acute. Even for established small and medium companies it is not at all easy to attract risk capital. The government, therefore, needs to pay serious attention to the problems of gathering risk capital for industry and from that standpoint review the whole structure of corporate taxation.||M. P.

The reasons for this are normally sought in the enlightened policies of the monarchical regime and of the christian missionaries. In this paper it is argued that the explanation for the spread of literacy and education as well as the founding of an impressive school network in Travancore is to be found in the favourable social and economic forces operating in that society. These may be identified as (a) commercialisation of the economy and the resultant demand for basic literary skills, (b) changes in the social structure and hence the rise of an elite from castes and communities which were not allowed so far to lay claim to bureaucratic positions linked to educational qualifications, and (c) the peculiar settlement pattern which made it possible for a larger proportion of people to make use of schools.

30/6/1984- ||special articles||4373361||Problems concerning Tubectomy Operations in Rural Areas of Punjab||This paper presents a case study of the unintended repercussions of one woman's tubectomy operation on her family. In the village in Punjab where the author worked, women reported experience of pain in the pelvic area and lower back region after the operation. This affected their work capacity and thereby their relationship within the family to their children and to their husbands. The author gives an account of woman's role in the productive process and the nature of her labour load, the crucial element in this regard being that the tasks assigned to her involved a great deal of bending and stretching. It is possible that the method of tubectomy used in field hospitals - chiefly mini-laparatomy - might have to be considered an unacceptable way of dealing with family planning in the rural areas given the type of work undertaken by women who are the wives of small farmers and labourers and its possible interaction with the operation itself. Since the causes of post-operative pain might be purely clinical and only subsequently aggravated by work conditions, the paper also describes the clinical milieu in which the tubectomy operation itself takes place and the attendant hospital conditions. A further section of the paper mentions the negative role played by the village dispensary and other doctors in the family planning process. Traditionally the younger woman or daughter-in-law's position within the household has been low. By regarding a woman as a target for a sterilisation operation as soon as she has two children, doctors merely acknowledge that and extent her low status into yet another additional arena.||Joyce Pettigrew

18/2/1984- ||special articles||4372960||Indian Patents Act and Its Relation to Technological Development in India: A Preliminary Investigation||The Indian Patents Act of 1970 embodied certain progressive suggestions in relation to industrial property rights. However, having enacted a Patents Act with tougher provisions for grant of patents and compulsory licensing, in order to compel foreigners to abide by those provisions and take out patents. India had to provide a credible threat and/or an attractive market. The threat could be posed by a high rate of innovative activity by domestic firms and research organisations, and the market could be provided by a high rate of industrial growth. Neither of these possibilities materialised. The diversion of a high proportion of R and D expenditure to expensive, unproductive sectors such as nuclear energy and space, the failure to build links between research laboratories and companies (government and private) and the slow rate of industrial growth held up domestic innovation activity. The sluggishness of industrial growth, the long gestation lags between investment and results, and the multiplication of bureaucratic requirements then led to a fall in the rate of patenting by foreign firms - particularly since the rate of technical progress in the international economy itself was slowing down. Any sense of disappointment with the new patents law should thus be attributed not to the law itself but to the general environment for innovation in India. The crisis in the world economy and the current state of disarray in the ranks of the Group of 77 have also contributed to the indifferent success of 'progressive' patent legislation in India, as in other third world countries.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi,Parthasarathi Banerjee,Uttam Kumar Bhattacharya
29/9/1984- ||review of agriculture, september 1984||4373619||Agricultural Labour under Colonial, Semi-Capitalist and Capitalist Conditions: A Case Study of West Bengal||Two kinds of issues concerning agricultural labourers have excited the interest of academics recently. First, the question how far the growth of agricultural labour is equivalent to a growth of capitalist relations in agricultural production. Whether they are free wage-labourers with the option to choose employers and having no particularly strong association with the individuals employing them or whether they are tied to their employers by a variety of pre-capitalist relationships is an issue on which an interesting debate has been going on. Second, the programme of the Left Front government in West Bengal with respect to this class too has become a subject of debate. The question has been raised of the immediate and the long-run perspective of the government's programme to improve their wage, employment and living conditions and the relevance of such reform for other sections of the peasantry. This paper begins with an account of the pre-British situation and then traces the growth of agricultural labourers under the British colonial regime. It shows how the growth corresponded to the economic policies of the colonial government and how, by the 1920s, the land-man ratio turned against the labourers, which not only led to a worsening of their condition, but also brought about a change in their ethnic composition. The author then examines developments during the three decades of Congress government when the proportion of agricultural labourers among rural workers reached new heights and the movement of agricultural labourers gathered momentum. Finally, the programme of the Left Front government is examined, along with a critical analysis of the criticisms voiced against it.||Biplab Dasgupta

28/1/1984- ||special articles||4372893||Planning for Underdevelopment: The Case of Doon Valley||'Economic growth' and 'development' are categories that are class-based, and their operation within a society leads to improved well-being for a minority while simultaneously denying the majority the access to basic resources for basic needs satisfaction, thus rendering them underdeveloped. Underdevelopment is therefore one of the final states created by development plans and not an initial state on which such plans act. The simultaneous polarised creation of development for the powerful interest groups and underdevelopment for society at large is particularly evident when a shrinking resource base historically coincides with the introduction of new and more powerful ways of exploiting scarce resources. This paper is aimed at substantiating the polarisation model of development under conditions of limited and shrinking resources with a case study of the utilisation of resources in the Doon Valley.||J.

It also suggests that the likely orders of decline in the gross fertility rates would be much less than what is postulated in the Registrar General's 'medium' projection. An alternative projection is offered here which accepts the mortality assumptions underlying the Registrar General's projections but starts with a higher base year population to allow for the undercount in the 1981 Census and postulates a slower decline in the incidence of marriage among females aged 15-44 and a slower increase in the proportion of eligible couples effectively protected. The author's projection also indicates the emergence of a labour force boom, especially in the 1990 s. And the fact that the urban share in the additions to both population and labour force will be between 45 to 50 per cent points to the urgent need for an urban focus to Indian planning.||K Sundaram

To understand the overall dynamics involved in the people-organisation mix in Japan one has to look at their industrial relations system and human resource management processes as these two are very closely linked to each other. The industrial relations model of Japan may not provide any direction to India since it would not be possible to 'redesign' the existing network of relations here. However, within the constraints of the existing framework, one has to make a beginning at the level of human resource management.||Jacob Mankidy

Thus extention of cropped area with irrigation, institutional innovations for supporting extension work and investment, and the technological breakthrough with the Green Revolution, respectively, over the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, have certainly propelled the growth of Indian agriculture. This article argues that growth is not yet finished, though the base for production growth and improvement in quality has to widen, and may at times while they are being undertaken to lead to temporary levelling off in the rates of growth of production. There is, therefore, room for cautious optimism in considering the future of Indian agriculture.||C. H. Shah

Equipment industries that started production in the sixties absorbed imported technology imperfectly, produced second-rate equipment and obtained high prices for it. Thereby they foisted high capital costs and low capacity utilisation on industries that had to buy their equipment. Similarly, non-engineering industries showed technological incompetence in dealing with problems of adaptation to local materials and equipment. The supply of technology to a firm in India is greatly increased by the fact that import controls prevent foreign firms from competing with it on equal terms in the Indian market. Further, the technology in use is so far behind best practice technology that a good deal of it can be picked up from textbooks, patents, technical literature and technicians. Hence the supply of technology to an Indian firm is much greater than to a technological leader in an industrial country, and the competitive weapon that is useful to an Indian firm is the capacity to search for, acquire and assimilate technology from external sources. Yet this capacity is not being used as a competitive weapon; on the contrary, we find many firms which show marked technological incapacity and yet continue to survive and to control significant market shares. Their survival can only be attributed to their protection from the competition of firms which use technology efficiently.||Ashok V. Desai

In the context of local resources and needs no the one hand, and poor infrastructural facilities on the other, woollen textile production in the cottage sector appears to be an important industry for hill areas development. This paper is being published in two parts. The first part, which appeared last week, attempted to gauge the importance of woollen textile production in the economy of the Kumaon hills of Uttar Pradesh, the pattern of employment in the cottage industry, and in particular, its significance as a home-based economic activity for women. Against the background of the increasingly dominant role assumed by the Khadi institutions in this sector, Part II of the paper, which appears below, examines the role and effectiveness of these institutions in generating income and employment in the industry.||Frances Sinha,Sanjay Sinha

Monetary statistics at present compiled and published by the Reserve Bank relate to monetary aggregates on an all-India basis. The spatio-temporal movements in money stock measures and their causative factors are subsumed in these data, rendering it difficult to study State level trends. The data on State-wise monetary aggregates presented here are admittedly insufficient for a thorough analysis of inter-State differences in monetary trends. For such an analysis, these estimates have necessarily to be supplemented by data on sources of change in money supply, i e, net bank credit to government, bank credit to commercial sector and foreign exchange assets of banking sector. This is an area where further research work needs to be done and the authors' estimates of State-level money stock measures constitute the first step in this direction.||T. K. Velayudham,K. A. Menon

28/7/1984- ||review of political economy, july 1984||4373468||Development of Capitalism in India||The latest international division of labour has set in motion a worldwide relocation of industries providing fillip to industrialisation in certain parts of the globe hitherto untouched by modern industry. Under the shadow of this broad sweep, will capitalist development in India result in a basic transformation in its state and society, and usher in the era of so-called 'modernisation'? This is the central question to which this paper addresses itself. Like the absolute ground-rent vis-a-vis capitalism in agriculture, the paper argues, the merchant's profit in a country such as India at its present stage of development acts as an obstacle to the growth of capitalism in industry. It further contends that the path of transition to full-fledged capitalism is blocked from both sides: above and below. Internally the structures is such that small capitalists find it difficult to move to higher levels; likewise, the landlords and capitalist farmers with investible resources are not sufficiently stimulated to transform themselves into industrial capitalists. On the other hand, large industrial capitalists are subject to competitive threat from world monopoly capital. The implications of such a class structure in respect of social evolution are briefly drawn at the end of the paper. Certain observations are also made on its bearing upon economic theory.||Ranjit Sau

The article examines the changes in the nature of work and remuneration, and the role played in these changes by the distribution of ownership of land, the caste of the households, and the sex of the workers. It concludes that, despite wider socio-economic differentiation, the essential structure of Dalena persists because of its proximity to the town. Caste continues to govern intra-village social relationships.||Sudha V. Rao

As long as the international economic system continues to work, the American banks and American economy are continuing to benefit. So it is rational for them, in the short run, the bluff as much as possible against their opponents and partners as long as the Americans have, or think they have, the financial ace that, at the moment, there is no alternative to the US dollar in the world economy. The Americans are, therefore, most reluctant to come to any alternative arrangement of the world financial system, while the Europeans and others are much more willing to do so, and some indeed are asking for a new arrangement. In the third world, the already increasing malfunctioning of the world economy and even more a possible breakdown of it will make economic political and cultural nationalism, and these often combined with religion, again the order of the day. There is likely to be all kinds of national and nationalist political adaptations of which that of Ayatollah Khomeiny in Iran is perhaps the most spectacular example so far. Faced with a crisis in the North and in the world economy, relatively autonomous development strategies have temporally a greater chance, at least in some parts of the Third World. These national and nationalist policy-responses to the economic crisis will not, however, be anti-systemic by making it more difficult for the system to work and will not contribute to the breakdown of the world economic and political system. On the contrary, they are likely again to be co-opted by the world economic system and will contribute to its eventual recovery and renewed strengthening during the next technological revolution, which will increase the North-South gap still further and leave the Third World further behind and more dependent than ever.||Andre Gunder Frank

This micro approach, rather than an overall macro approach, is useful in two ways: first, in highlighting the reasons for the low productivity observed in a few key or important industries, and secondly, in bringing out the absence of any direct link between investment and efficiency. There has been much talk lately of the problem of uneconomic scales of production in India, but it is frequently forgotten in this connection that there are serious scale diseconomies in large scale production insofar as 'management' is concerned and that the existing low productivity (or lack of efficiency) of Indian manufacturing industry stems from inefficient management rather than from technological reasons. While scale economies are not to be ignored and technologically inefficient options are to be avoided for most part, the major lacuna in Indian industry today is managerial. In fact, it is sometimes the quest for achieving scale economies that leads to inefficiency through under-utilisation of capacity, whether because of managerial failures or inadequacy of demand.||Arun Ghosh

The results of the study clearly show that (1) the impact of administered price changes on relative and absolute prices cannot be assessed without taking into consideration their mutual interactions; (2) the success of administered price revisions as an instrument to generate additional resources mobilisation in the public sector cannot be assessed in a partial equilibrium model; and (3) the inflating potential of changes in administered prices is significantly high and the potential for generating additional saving is much less than the nominal effects.||S.

In the context of local resources and needs on the one hand, and poor infrastructural facilities on the other, woollen textile production in the cottage sector appears to be an important industry for hill areas development. Part I of this paper, to be published in two parts, attempts to gauge the importance of woollen textile production in the economy of the Kumaon hills of Uttar Pradesh, the pattern of employment in the cottage industry and, in particular, its significance as a home-based economic activity for women. Against the background of the increasingly dominant role assumed by the Khadi institutions in this sector, Part II of the paper, to be published next week, examines the role and effectiveness of these institutions in generating income and employment in the industry.||Frances Sinha,Sanjay Sinha

This has rekindled interest in the transfer of technology to Third World countries by the transnational corporations. Numerous studies on the nature and structure of technology markets, the role of the patent system and the mechanisms and costs of technology transfer are now available. The crucial question in evaluating the degree of technological dependence is, however, the technological capabilities of the local partners or the domestic firms. Unless the Third World enterprises are in a position to 'unpackage' the technology, the process of selection, diffusion, adaptation and absorption is not facilitated. The degree of unpackaging also determines the linkages that are established with the domestic industrial structures - engineering consultancy firms, machinery manufacturers and producers of intermediates - to generate independent technological capabilities. The TNCs, on the other hand, resist this process, because it threatens their control over technology and may bring into the market firms who may threaten their position. This control, often through an interlocking system of patents, assures them a well protected long-term market, not only for final products but for most technological and physical inputs. Keeping the technology within a system of transnational subsidiaries and affiliates is the most effective means of ensuring this; but even independent firms can be kept dependent if the degree of packaging is high or if the patent system acts as a barrier. This paper attempts to assess the technology transfer experience of India in the capital-and-technology-intensive petro-chemicals industry.||Sushil Khanna

The sluggish pace of growth of industrial employment coupled with high population growth rates in less developed countries has made it clear that for quite some time agriculture will have to continue to provide employment to many in LDCs. The present paper discusses selected issues relating to labour use in agriculture, focusing specifically on tapioca and paddy crops which are extensively cultivated in the developing countries, with the help of farm level data pertaining to Kerala. In particular it examines the relationship between labour use on the one hand and yields, farm-size, crop-operations on the other; and also the question of labour productivity in agriculture.||K. N.

This approach is based on the assumption, quite plausible for Indian conditions, that the distribution of levels of living of households at and above the poverty line is positively skewed and log-normal. The authors first set out their main assumptions and state some of the properties of the three-parameter log-normal distribution. An outline of the proposed methods of estimation is then given and a simple numerical example is worked out to illustrate the approach. Using this approach, some further empirical results of economic significance, based on an analysis of the available National Sample Survey (NSS) data over a period of time, are presented. Finally, a brief summary of the major findings and limitations is given in the concluding section.||N. S. Iyengar,M. H. Suryanarayana

Much of this controversy, however, arises out of a lack of understanding of the conflicting effects on the net welfare of various social classes that are generated by a given change in the price and/or output of foodgrains. The object of this paper is to briefly review (a) trends in food production and consumption, and (b) some aspects of terms of trade and food price policy debate, and to analyse the relative impacts of price and technology policies on changes in output, income distribution and consumption of various classes in the rural and urban sectors, on the basis of results derived from a computable equilibrium (CGE) model for India.||Alain de Janvry,K.

By comparing Kerala with West Bengal, the only other major State dominated by left oriented political parties, the paper shows that Kerala's fertility level has been lower than West Bengal's since 1951-60, and in partial contradiction to Ratcliffe's hypothesis, the distribution of income, consumption expenditure and household assets has been generally more inequalitarian in Kerala than West Bengal. However, the distribution of social services, such as educational, health services, have been more equitable (e g, emphasis on elementary education, primary health services and women) in Kerala than in West Bengal. The paper suggests that the higher decline of fertility in Kerala is associated more with greater equity in education and health facilities than with greater equity in income and assets.||Moni Nag

24/3/1984- ||special articles||4373081||Inflation and Evasion||The Union Budget 1984-85 has been acclaimed as one giving a variety of concessions. It is argued that some of these 'concessions' may not be concessions at all when viewed in the light of our double-digit inflation. Moreover, it is likely that this budget will fuel inflation, thereby removing in the long-run what minimal concessions the fixed-income classes may be receiving in the immediate future. As far as the problem of tax-evasion is concerned, a determined government can curb much of it quite easily. It does not do so because the existing system allows it to pursue a convenient dual policy. It keeps the tax rates progressive on paper so that the poor feel happy. It keeps a blind eye on tax-evasion, this keeps the rich happy. In this situation there is very little that a budget can achieve. But nevertheless there is scope for some tax-reforms which would make evasion more difficult.||Kaushik Basu

The conflictis only partly aboutthe statisticalbasis ofthe quantification of the malnourished. To a much greater extent it is due to the fact that the various opponents take their stands upon the basis of fundamentally different theoretical frameworks — often, it seems, without any consciousness of that fact. Like many other groups of natural scientists, nutritionists have been slow to assimilate the implications of the developments in the history and philosophy of science which, during the last decade or so, have indicated the connections between scientific theory and social ideology, and which have given insights into the nature of the processes through which théories are developed and tested. The purpose of this paper is to try to show that if we want to assess the current state of knowledge and controversy in nutrition, then it is as important to understand the nature of the social and political context within which any particular theory has arisen, as it is to judge the technical quality of the data and the criteria which have been used to test it.||Philip Payne,Peter Cutler

Among the major issues analysed by the author are recent developments in foreign private investment, major international interventions to influence the behaviour of NTCs and the new responses of TNCs to the changing policies and controls of host governments. These issues should be of interest to policy-makers and entrepreneurs in India which is no longer just a host country to TNCs but is emerging as a home country for a growing number of TNCs of Indian origin. Towards the end of the paper, likely trends in the policies of LDC governments towards TNCs and their implications are highlighted.||Samuel Paul
14/7/1984- ||special articles||4373409||Should 'Caste' Be the Basis for Recognising Backwardness?||All the commissions appointed by the Central and state governments so far to suggest measures for removal of social and educational backwardness have recognised 'caste' as the source of backwardness and identified particular castes as backward. The list of castes so identified have represented largely the judgments of the different commissions based on implicit as well as explicit recognition of the traditional ritual caste hierarchy. The Mandal Commission (1978-80) appointed an Experts Committee, comprising distinguished academicians, to suggest criteria of backwardness by which particular castes could be recognised as backward. The author argues here that the Experts Committee's understanding of backwardness was inconsistent with its perspective. This paper accepts the Committee's perspective and goes further from it, particularly keeping in view the type of society envisaged in the directive principles of the Indian Constitution. The Mandal Commission ignored the perspective of the Experts Committee but took note of its view that caste can be the persistent and recognisable unit with reference to which backwardness can be judged. The larger part of this paper, the whole of section II, is devoted to the opposite view that caste cannot be taken as such a unit if the perspective of the Experts Committee is accepted. The considerations in favour of the alternative view, as they follow from the author's critique, are stated at the beginning of Section III. The last section of the paper deals with explication of these considerations in concrete, though broad, terms. Further, it is argued that, in view of the society envisaged, de-reservation should be an integral part of the recommended measures. Finally, and more importantly, these measures will not have the desired results if they are not accompanied by extra-legal efforts, for instance, social and economic movements. Not only that, the tendency will be to justify the measures, as the Mandal Commission does, with reference to the new stratification that is arising as a result of these measures among the backward classes.||I.

The paradoxes disappear once an appropriate variable, such as property holdings, is brought into the analysis. The issue has far-reaching implications, not only for our understanding of demographic differentials but also for measurement of poverty. Poverty measurement currently places undue emphasis on per-capita expenditure and food consumption. The 'reclassification' phenomenon, discussed at length in this paper, can transfer even agricultural labour households into upper per-capita expenditure groups, for in such households an infant death raises the 'level of living' quite significantly. Apart from this, there is the question of 'demographically-destitute' families (including those headed by women) concentrated in low family income groups. Not only per capita income but also family income and property holdings are thus relevant to any discussion on poverty. The move from estimates based on food consumption in per-capita expenditure groups to a better understanding of dimensions of poverty would, however, require explicit recognition of the importance of infant and adult mortality to the measurement of poverty.||N.

18/2/1984- ||special articles||4372961||Groups in a New: Politics of Transformation||Trends of increasing poverty, inequality, growing landlessness and unemployment on the one hand, and growing centralisation of power coupled with a more frequent and intense use of the repressive machinery by the State to crush local movements have been clearly in evidence for some time now. Also in evidence has been the incapacity of the macro-organisations of the poor - the political parties concerned, the kisan sabhas, the trade unions - to act effectively against these trends. While the failures of the larger organisations are recognised, they are rarely discussed. Among the major reasons of this failure seem to be the very structure of these organisations - the relationship between the leaders and the cadres within the organisation and the cadres and the working masses - as well as the methodology of change followed. Concentration on a partial approach to change, relying only on economic, social, or cultural issues, does not permit the development of a vehicle or tendency which can adequately reflect the total aspirations of the oppressed. It is in response to the failures of the macro-organisations to initiate positive developmental and participative tendencies that, of late, attention has begun to be focused on organisations and activities outside the purview of both the government and the political parties. Variously called voluntary agencies, non-government organisations, or non-party political formations, these organisations and activities have been the focus of discussion in the country over the last decade. This paper is an attempt to intervene in the discussion about their role, responsibility, functions, and limitations.||Harsh Sethi

But after about age 35 men almost certainly experience much heavier death rates than women, and at these later ages male life expectation is probably significantly shorter than that of females. Male death rates at later ages in India are surprisingly high by international standards. Such 'excess' male adult mortality has recently been detected in other populations in Asia, where it has been linked to tuberculosis. It seems probable that this link exists in India too. But this requires further study.||Tim Dyson

In doing this as a follow-up to earlier exercises, it indicates the shortcomings in the official estimates as well as in those by a couple of other scholars. In sum, the paper concludes that there are anywhere between 2 and 20 million people supposed to have been lifted above the poverty line in 1981-82, who cannot be traced to any programme of poverty reduction. In addition, there are 18 million persons whose existence the planners do not concede by virtue of the official method of Census enumeration. These unrecognised millions of the poor make further nonsense of the paper exercises at poverty reduction in our planning.||K. Sundaram,S. D. Tendulkar

Cuts in personal taxation have been granted with a view to pleasing the middle class. However, the real benefits of these high visibility measures would be enjoyed by the rich. Excise duty cuts on certain items have been suggested on the grounds that this would help to stabilise or even bring down prices, but the more important reason appears to be to give a boost to the sagging demand for the products of selected industries. Similarly, the Finance Bill appears to contain a number of measures to check evasion and avoidance of taxes. However, all these measures taken together will hardly touch the proverbial tip of the iceberg.||Arun Kumar

08/12/1984- ||special articles||4373849||Culture, State and the Rediscovery of Indian Politics||The relationship between culture and the state may be viewed in two ways. One is to look for the means by which culture can be made to contribute to the sustenance and growth of the state. Elements of culture which help strengthen the state are seen as good; those which do not help the proper functioning of the state or hinder its growth are seen as defective. The second way of looking at the relationship between culture and the state is to do so from the stand-point of culture. This approach may regard the state as a protector, an internal critic or a thermostat for culture, but not as the ultimate pace-setter for the society's way of life. For the last 150 years, westernised, middle-class Indians have learnt to look at the first approach-the one which orients the needs of the culture to the needs of the state-as the very epitome of political maturity, achievement and development. True, there has been another intellectual current which has looked at the needs of the society differently, seeing state-oriented politics as a means of criticising Indian culture, even as a means of renegotiating traditional social relationships, but refusing to acknowledge such politics as the raison d'etre of Indian civilisation. However, since the middle of the nineteenth century, this concept has survived only as a part of an intellectual underground. It is only now that this recessive strain of consciousness is again coming into its own. This consciousness has been endorsed by (1) an increasingly oppressive state-machine which constantly threatens the survival and the ways of life of those Indians it has marginalised, and (2) the growing efforts of these marginalised sections to interpret their predicament in terms alien to the modern world and to the state-centred scholarship. This strain of consciousness, the author argues here, will begin to set the pace of the public consciousness in India in the coming decades.||Ashis Nandy

The team's conclusions are at two levels. At one level, there are various problems in the planning and implementation of the project, most of which can be eliminated (at least theoretically) by proper 'management'. But at another level, the question arises whether the project as a whole (even if successfully implemented) and the broad policy behind it, are really 'development' in the true sense of the word or whether they may not lead to a chain of environmentally destructive consequences which could negate all the short-term gains made by the project. The environmental, socio-cultural and economic sanity of the project is clearly questionable.||Ashish Kothari,Rajiv Bhartari

Every intervention planned by government to provide relief to the hand-printers by restricting mill printing has been resolutely frustrated by the implementation machinery. The implications of this failure extend beyond the fortunes of the hand-printing industry. The pattern of technological growth in the textile printing industry is clearly contrary to the employment policy of the Plan, which is to maximise labour absorption and minimise capital per unit of output and per person employed. Hand-printing not only satisfies this criteria, it is also low in energy consumption. Notwithstanding these advantages substantial investment has been allowed to be made in machine printing and indigenous manufacture of printing machines. This pattern of growth is also in violation of the letter and spirit of the Industrial Policy Resolution.||L. C. Jain,Rita Kapadia

(ii) Variations in growth rates between the pre- and post-green revolution periods in each district and differences between the districts. (iii) Inter-district variations in fluctuations in agricultural production. (iv) Variations in instability indices between the pre- and post-green revolution periods. The author finds that the degree of instability in agricultural production is high in all the districts. It is higher for foodgrains than for 'all crops'. The districts of North coastal Andhra combine high instability with low growth. Nalgonda district in Telangana is rather unique in having experienced high growth rates of production with low instability. The post-green revolution period shows a higher degree of instability. There is also a suggestion that districts which have achieved higher growth rates are also subject ot greater instability.||G. Parthasarathy

07/7/1984- ||special articles||4373382||Defuse the Debt Bomb?: When Apparent Solutions Become Real Problems||The essential reason why defusing the debt bomb-and the Third World debt bomb in particular-is so difficult is that the same apparent common interests in the mutual benefits of constructing the bomb for the common good turn into conflicting interests among creditors, and between them and debtors, and among the debtors themselves about how to share out the costs of defusing and dismantling the bomb. No one voluntarily sacrifices the short-term gains or wants to agree to assume any of the long-term burdens. So each of the banking, business, government and other participants taken individually finds it in his short-run interest to continue to expand the debt bomb still further - and thereby to shorten its fuse. This paper examines how the Third World debt bomb was constructed through that part of the 1970s financial mechanism that was intended to maintain the world economy going by pumping money into the Third World through bank loans. It then discusses how - particularly through the 1979-82 world recession - what had appeared to be a solution turned instead into a major part of the problem, with severe repercussions for the real process of production and trade in the world.||Andre Gunder Frank

The Central Plan outlay is to be stepped up by as much as 25 per cent, but no major tax efforts have been made. And yet the magnitude of deficit financing is estimated not to exceed Rs 1,762 crore, which is less than Rs 200 crore in excess of what was proposed in last year's budget. What then has happened to the fiscal crisis which even the Economic Survey had hinted at? How has the Finance Minister managed his sums so that so much seems achievable with so little effort? The simple answer to this is that there is a great deal of 'window dressing'. The impression of fiscal soundness which the Budget exudes is altogether misleading.||Prabhat Patnaik

21/7/1984- ||special articles||4373436||Management of Exchange Rate of Rupee since Its Basket Link||Exchange rates of the major currencies have been floating for over a decade now. This period has witnessed high volatility and persistent misalignments of the principal currencies. The implications of exchange rate instability for balance of payments, costs and prices, and above all investment, have been matters of intense debate among financial analysts and policy-makers. The growing volatility of exchange rates and instability in exchange markets have posed special problems to all countries, but these problems are specially intractable for developing countries. In its efforts to reduce the adverse effects of wide fluctuations of major currencies, India switched from a fixed single currency peg to a managed basket-pegged arrangement for the rupee. We have had the basked link for nine years now and it is necessary to look back and assess the performance of the rupee during this period. The key issues in this context are: (1) the success or otherwise of the basket link in reducing the volatility of the exchange rate of the rupee, (2) the relationship of the exchange rate of the rupee over time to cost and price changes in India relative to its trade partners, (3) the response of trade and current account balance to the nominal and real variations of the exchange rates of the rupee, and its implications for exchange rate policy in the future. These are some of the issues analysed in this study. This paper is being published in two parts. The first part, which appeared last week examined how far the basket link has been successful in reducing the volatility of the rupee's exchange rate and discussed the exchange rate of the rupee in relation to the cost and price changes in India relative to those in its major trading partners. The second part of the article, which appears below, discusses exchange rate policy for the future in the light of the response of exports and imports and the current account balance to the nominal and real variations in the exchange rate of the rupee.||S.

First, in contradiction to one strand of conventional wisdom about labour, the coir workers' union grew in strength and militancy during a depression. Second, the union successfully sublimated the deep caste and religious antagonisms of Kerala society - similar communal fissures elsewhere in India ripped unions apart - such that by the 1940s it could fairly describe itself as a class-conscious organisation. This paper attempts to explain these two features of the labour movement in the coir industry.||Robin Jeffrey

It is for this reason probably that studies which demonstrate the malleability of the caste structure and beliefs remain at the level of case studies and have not been able to provide an alternative conspectus on the issue of castes at a general level. The purpose of this paper is to suggest an alternative conceptual formulation on castes which can fully integrate many of the empirical findings. [The paper is being published in three parts.

While the critics of the TNCs highlight the nature of the market power possessed by the TNCs, the sources of such market power, the exaggerated claims made by the TNCs about the therapeutic value of the drugs developed by them, the over-pricing by the TNCs of the materials imported into the developing countries, etc, the defenders of the present structure dominated by the TNCs try to counter these arguments. The question of manufacturing technology developed by indigenous firms in the developing countries has been neglected in the literature, although it has a bearing on the debate regarding the role of the TNCs in the developing countries. This paper deals with the question of development of manufacturing technologies by indigenous pharmaceutical firms in India in the context of the manufacturing activities of the TNCs. Its basic objective is to analyse whether, and if so to what extent, manufacturing technology is available with the indigenous sector to replace drug-manufacturing by the TNCs.||Sudip Chaudhuri

This period has witnessed high volatility and persistent misalignments of the principal currencies. The implications of exchange rate instability for balance of payments, costs and prices, and above all investment, have been matters of intense debate among financial analysts and policy-makers. The growing volatility of exchange rates and the instability in exchange markets have posed special problems to all countries, but these problems are specially intractable for developing countries. In its efforts to reduce the adverse effects of wide fluctuations of major currencies, India switched from a fixed single currency peg to a managed basket-pegged arrangement for the rupee. We have had the basket link for nine years now and it is necessary to look back and assess the performance of the rupee during this period. The key issues in this context are: (1) the success or otherwise of the basket link in reducing the volatility of the exchange rate of the rupee, (2) the relationship of the exchange rate of the rupee over time to cost and price changes in India relative to its trade partners, and (2) the response of trade and current account balance to the nominal and real variations of the exchange rates of the rupee and its implications for exchange rate policy in the future. These are some of the issues analysed in this study. This paper is published in two parts. The first part, which appears below, examines how far the basket link has been successful in reducing the volatility of the rupee's exchange rate and discusses the exchange rate of the rupee in relation to the cost and price changes in India relative to those in its major trading partners. The second part of the article, to appear next week, will discuss exchange rate policy for the future in the light of the response of exports and imports and the current account balance to the nominal and real variations in the exchange rate of the rupee.||S.

It also includes a brief review of the various relevant government policies formulated over time. Part II of this paper contains evidence on the development of sub-contracting in Indian industry, documented from a number of secondary sources. The paper concludes by posing a number of questions which need to be answered to arrive at a better understanding of this dimension of industrial change.||R. Nagaraj

The seemingly dramatic political changes in Karnataka since the 1970s thus present a sharp contrast to the conservative social order, and demand an explanation. In order to understand these political changes, the authors argue, it is necessary to grasp the strategies Devaraj Urs pursued to capture power and to retain it. These strategies in turn provoked reactions, the significance of which Urs himself failed to grasp. Devaraj Urs pursued a two-pronged policy, one which sought to tackle the problem of poverty, and the other which tackled social problems which were intimately linked with poverty, viz, inequality, oppression and exploitation. The two prongs gave rise to contradictory consequences of which Urs himself later bacame a victim. However, while the latter event was the short-term result, on a long-term view Urs initiated measures which may yet bring about structural changes in Karnataka society.||M. N. Srinivas,M. N. Panini

A series of unstructured interviews were conducted with officials in these three ministries to understand the organisation of policy analysis within the ministries, and to identify major issues for further research. What is presented in this note is a set of preliminary observations for discussion.||Rushikesh M. Maru,R. S. Ganapathy

This study of some villages in the Kosi region brings out that while some growth has occurred, it has been unevenly distributed. Small pockets of high-productivity capitalist agriculture have developed, but the semi-feudal mode of production which dominates the area has proved resistant to change. There is little sign that households in the authors' sample have benefited from such growth as has occurred. Real incomes, which in 1970-71 were insufficient to meet calorie recommendations even if devoted exclusively to cereals and pulses, have changed little; the pattern of access to land, the occupational pattern, even total population size are all much the same in 1981 as in 1971. In some respects the situation seems to have worsened. The quality of the diet may well have deteriorated; the real wage has declined; mortality levels, high in any case, seem to have risen in the 1970s, especially among girls. The proportion of the population mainly dependent on wage labour has risen, suggesting some downward mobility among small cultivators.||Gerry Rodgers,Janine Rodgers

At the same time, Indian housing policy has relied upon rent controls to constrain increases in house rents. Since the Courts have found that property assessments are to be based upon rents paid rather than on what the property would fetch in a free market, rent control has adversely affected the level and growth of property tax revenues in Indian cities. In this study, the author has constructed a model capable of showing the effect of rent controls on the property tax base of Indian cities. The model, which incorporates spillover effects of rent control on rents of non-controlled houses, is sufficiently general for application to other locations where similar institutional constraints apply. The model is estimated using data from the City of Calcutta. The findings indicate that relaxation of rent controls could result in a more than a doubling of Calcutta's property tax revenues, from 160 million rupees to approximately Rs. 350 million using current rate structures.||Shyam Nath

The authors argue that what was essentially a historically necessary demand for restructuring Centre-state relations has been allowed to develop into a divisive communal issue. Their contention is that the Punjab problem has resulted from a combination of socio-economic and political factors and therefore to understand its complexities it is necessary to study the economic changes along with the forces in the superstructure. Only thus can class-based organisations wrest the initiative.||Sucha Singh Gill,K. C. Singhal

The purse seine operators (mostly non-fishermen), on the other hand, consider it a highly productive field for investment, despite all the attendant risks. The fish merchants have welcomed purse seine fishing as it assures them of a large quantity of fish for selling at considerable profit in the interior markets. Ice manufacturers too are enthusiastic about the new development as it offers a large market for their product. The objective of this article is to highlight the need for a judicious exploitation of the marine fishery resources of Kerala by utilising the new technology without adversely affecting the interests of the traditional fishermen. The Kerala Marine Fishing Regulation Act has got provisions for this. What is needed is their vigorous implementation.||Ramakrishnan Korakandy

While all these attitudes were but different expressions of the ideology of the empire, it is interesting to note that as we move into the nineteenth century, India, Britain's largest colony, became the battleground of several conflicting ideologies which had grown in the course of the Industrial Revolution and which in many senses overlapped. The strength and practicability of thought-trends like Utilitarianism and Evangelicalism were tried out on Indian soil but not without resistance from those who held that the imposition of Western morals and institutions could be of little benefit to India. This article tries to discuss in brief the emergence of these attitudes in the early part of the nineteenth century.||Udayon Misra

While this did not involve any automatic or inevitable 'slide-back' from secular ideals, what was crucial was the manner in which the question was perceived, the very understanding of what 'communities' meant. This paper seeks to illustrate this complex pattern through a study of Premchand's writings. It shows that though Premchand's was a consistently principled support to communal unity, his reactions to specific situations or issues at times deviated from this stance. It argues that a body of inherited assumptions, deeply rooted in his mind, militated against the secular nationalist values to which he was attached, and produced an ambivalence in his responses to the Hindu-Muslim question.||Geetanjali Pandey

In the literature dealing with this 'crisis', three aspects have received substantial attention. These are (i) the deceleration in the growth of demand for the products of the industry; (ii) the technical backwardness of the industry reflected in the persistence of backward and outdated techniques, including machinery that has long crossed its normal life span, and (iii) the uneven incidence of both the decline in demand and the backwardness of technique across firms in the industry, resulting in the coexistence of firms with widely varying levels of productivity and technical advance on the one hand, and wide variations in financial performance on the other. This paper is concerned with delineating those aspects of the structure of markets and nature of technology in the textile industry, which, in the given environment, necessitate the emergence of the above trends.||C.

It was not easy to realise this objective and the Company's efforts met with resistance. The Fakir, Sannyasi and peasant struggles of 1763-1793, which combined an element of spontaneity with an element of organised leadership from outside, are an example of such resistance. This article analyses the organisation and activities of the Fakirs and Sanyasis and the reasons for their rebellion together with those for the peasant participation in this rebellion.||Suranjan Chatterjee

This may be because the National Sample Survey Organisation, which is the only official agency that collects such data for the whole country, does not generally publish data on consumer expenditures separately for SC/ST. This paper tries to study this neglected area by analysing the ungrouped NSS data of the 28th and 32nd rounds. The main objects of the paper are to examine the levels of living of the SC/ST vis-a-vis the non-SC/ST in Karnataka and inequality in the levels of living of the SC/ST and the non-SC/ST during 1973-74 and 1977-78. The authors also briefly examine the disparities in the levels of education and the occupational structure of households in the different groups under study.||Vijay Nayak,Shailaja Prasad

Concentrating on two villages in Bangalore district, it seeks to examine whether (a) the scheme meets its stated objective of providing subsidised houses to the poorest, and (b) whether it reinforces or weakens the rural social structure. Based on questionnaires canvassed and personal interviews with the state and local bureaucracy and locally elected leaders on the one hand and the villagers on the other, the study concludes that when viewed in a dynamic perspective, the scheme appears to have failed as a welfare measure. The very provisions of the scheme and the manner of its implementation were such that the scheme not merely failed to provide subsidised houses to the poorest but has in the process reinforced rather than mitigated structural and social inequalities. With the major implementors coming from the rural elite, the scheme was used as free patronage to further social control in one village and to reap monetary gains, in the other. The study recommends that unless the poorest themselves are adequately represented on the implementing machinery, it would be difficult for such schemes to succeed as public welfare measures. This paper has been published in two parts. Part I, which appeared last week, discussed the intent behind the housing scheme, its implementation and the background of the beneficiaries. Part II, below, deals with the implications of the scheme for the social structure of the villages under study.||Mira Bakhru

The data is also used to weigh one aspect of present dairy policy, viz, the establishment of 'Anand pattern' milk procurement co-operatives in villages, by speculating as to the effect such a co-operative would have on patterns of livestock holding and milk consumption if established in the village under study.||Shanti George

Tax laws in India including the Income Tax Act, are honeycombed with tax expenditures. It seems the policy-makers in India have a soft corner for tax expenditures. They generally respond favourably to demands for introduction, extension, enlargement, and maintenance of tax expenditures. This paper critically examines issues like the accounting of these expenditures, tax expenditure provisions in tax laws and the extent of governmental assistance provided through these provisions.||Anand P.

03/11/1984- ||special articles||4373719||The Debate on Imperialism Just before Lenin||A new discussion on Lenin's "Imperialism" seems to be starting in various parts of the world. In his paper "Towards a Correct Reading of Lenin's Theory of Imperialism" criticised previous debates and raised some central points on the relationship between colonialism and imperialism; on Rosa Luxemburg's contribution; on the composite nature of monoply capital; on the export of capital; and on the national liberation struggles and Lenin's contribution. Second, since the first two volumes of F Braudel's "Civilisation and Capitalism" are now available in English, the reader can fully appreciate the remarks on the general significance of Lenin's theses on monopoly capitalism with which the French historian concludes "Afterthoughts on Material Civilisation and Capitalism" (The John Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1977). Third, from North America may be singled out S K Holloway's recent "Relations among Core Capitalist States: The Kautsky-Lenin Debate Reconsidered" (Canadian Journal of Political Science, June 1983) in which the famous debate is taken as a point of reference for a discussion of current Marxist literature on the 'theory of the state'. In this note an old problem comes up: Kautsky's articles on imperialism are not available in English. The English speaking reader can only rely on general books like G Steenson, "K Kautsky, 1854-1938: Marxism in Classic Years" (Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh University Press, 1978) and M Salvadori, "K Kautsky and the Socialist Revolution" (London, New Left Books, 1979). However, Kautsky's contribution on imperialism is essential also for a better understanding of Lenin's work. This is the road that the present paper (translated from Italian by Mark Eaton) tries to open up. The paper which draws on the first part of the author's book "La teoria economica di Lenin" (Roma-Bari, Laterza, 1981) summarises and interprets Kautsky's work from within the contemporary debate in the workers' movement at the 1914 turning point in history, with the aim of anatomising Kautsky's orthodox and centrist views on the working and the perspectives of capitalism. Finally, in a post-script, the author briefly raises some critical questions that come out of this discussion. [This paper has been published in two parts. The first part appeared last week.]||L.

19/5/1984-26/5/1984||special articles||4373280||Class Conflict and Workers' Movement in Ahmedabad Textile Industry, 1918-23||Studies in the history of trade unionism have always treated the textile workers' movement in Ahmedabad as unique with its origin in the Gandhian ideology. Its goal of peaceful industrial relations has earned warm praise from conservative studies, whereas studies from a Left perspective have heaped criticism on it. However, what is needed is neither praise nor blame, but a search for answers to certain questions. Among them are: Why did the workers of Ahmedabad support Gandhi and his trade union. How did they perceive the movement? What did the movement and the trade union give to them? These questions need to be answered to understand the nature of the workers' participation in the industry and to understand how the movement grew. Surely, Gandhi was not the sole reason: there were other cultural-ideological, political and economic reasons, which provided the context if not the direct motivation. This paper attempts an analysis of the nature of the workers' movement in the Ahmedabad textile industry during 1918-23. It argues that this movement can be better understood only by analysing its context - viz, the non-co-operation movement and the economic compulsions and ideological orientation of the millowners of Ahmedabad.||Sujata Patel

This is, of course, not a review of the book. The attempt is to seek the validity and relevance of the concepts of westernisation and sanskritisation in the context of India, seventeen years after the public expression of Srinivas's thinking. It is, therefore, necessary to outline the context then and now. The attempt implies the reader's perspective which is delineated in Section I. In section II the elites are taken up for re-reading and reflecting. Section III is the concluding note.||I. P. Desai

Yet the anthropologists' approach holds great promise for peace research. What anthropologists can particularly impart to such studies is the capacity to take into account a people's inside views of the world and the issues, to articulate them with outside observers' findings, and to relate both to comparisons among cultures. Such comparisons are essential for an understanding of any institution as widely maintained among societies as is war. An anthropological approach should be useful for at least three kinds of preparatory studies: those concerning measures for institutional changes among nations, those relating to changes within particular nations and those dealing with underlying cultural and social forces.||David G.

17/11/1984- ||special article||4373769||Socio-Economic Factors in Educational Development: Case of Nineteenth Century Travancore||Travancore state is found to have had relatively better spread of literacy in the nineteenth century itself. The reasons for this are normally sought in the enlightened policies of the monarchical regime and of the Christian missionaries. In this paper it is argued that the explanation for the spread of literacy and education as well as the founding of an impressive school network in Travancore is to be found in the favourable social and economic forces operating in that society. These may be identified as (a) commercialisation of the economy and the resultant demand for basic literary skills, (b) changes in the social structure and hence the rise of an elite from castes and communities which were not allowed so far to lay claim to bureaucratic positions linked to educational qualifications, and (c) the peculiar settlement pattern which made it possible for a larger proportion of people to make use of schools.

15/9/1984- ||special articles||4373574||Blurring the Lines between Parties and Social Bases: Gundu Rao and Emergence of a Janata Government in Karnataka||In the absence of an organisational instrument capable of rigorous, relatively centralised control of the regions, leaders at the national level have been able to make their influence penetrate down to the regional level and below most effectively by means of compromise and bargaining with powerful groups in regional and sub-regional areas. Since 1970 or so Indira Gandhi has tended to depart from this method by attempting to operate by diktat on the erroneous assumption that this will enable her to make her influence penetrate more effectively to lower levels and second, to homogenise the politics of the varied regions. In the vast majority of regions her attempts have eroded the corporate substance of her party and have cut her off from those areas. States have tended to diverge from one another as indicated by the emergence of regional parties in some states. This article is an initial report, in the above context, on the internal political developments in Karnataka between the first week of 1980 and early 1984. One of its purpose is to discuss whether events in Karnataka lead us to believe that state politics in India are 'in crisis'. Another is to consider whether the general election of 1980 or events since then have constituted a return to 'normality' in the politics of the state.||James Manor

Agriculture and employment are the two major sectors in which the Scheduled Castes are at present engaged. The policy of protective discrimination has been practised with regard to employment, whereas there are obvious difficulties in operating such a clear-cut policy in agriculture. One way of resolving the controversy on the need to continue protectionism is to ask how the Scheduled Castes have fared in the two sectors - one where protectionist policy has been operated and the other where these people have had to fend for themselves. This paper addresses this question with reference to the state of Andhra Pradesh.||Uma Ramaswamy

That is why the MRTP (Amendment) Bill, 1983, which enhances the already very considerable powers conferred on the government needs to be opposed even though there are aspects of it which are technically sound and welcome. Democratic and leftist forces need to be wary of the radical slogans under whose cover the discretionary and arbitrary powers of an essentially conservative regime will be enhanced.||H. K. Paranjape

Despite various laws, the intervention of the trade unions, and measures by government relations between labour and management in the tea estates of this state have been deteriorating over the years. This paper is an attempt to describe and analyse the present condition of labour relations in the tea gardens of North Bengal, with special reference to the gardens in Jalpaiguri district which is the larger of the two main tea-growing districts in the state.||Prasanneswari

Following that line of reasoning, the missionaries' main contribution may have been to start a movement to purge Hindu society of its most glaring social evils as well as to stimulate a revival and resurgence of Hindu belief and practices, about the last thing the missionaries could have wanted. It is these unintended but nevertheless far-reaching effects of missionary activity that form the main theme of this study of the London Missionary Society (LMS) in nineteenth century Travancore.||Dick Kooiman

Although the country has been one of the major producers of oilseeds in the world, its share in the total world oilseeds trade has declined over the years. Further, the oilseeds and edible oil sector has been in the grip of speculators and hoarders and is also susceptible to climatic variations. The NDDB has sought to deal with these problems by promoting co-operatives of oilseeds growers. One such co-operative, the Grofed in Gujarat set up in 1979, has rapidly grown embracing in three years farmers growing groundnut over an area exceeding two lakh hectares. This paper presents the findings of a study on Grofed's operations which investigated the impact of oilseeds co-operatives on the incomes of the participants vis-a-vis non-participants, the impact on procurement prices due to the presence of the co-operatives, Grofed's impact on farm productivity and on the average daily wages of landless labourers.||Tushar Shah,Shrikant Modak

Estimates of acreage and yield per acre of individual crops are prepared on the basis of extensive sample surveys and crop cuts, using the scientific sampling methodology pioneered at the Indian Statistical Institute in the 1940s. Compared to those of other states, the official data for West Bengal are relatively close to the independent acreage and yield estimates prepared by the National Sample Survey Organisation from 1957 to 1969. A close examination of the data reveals, however, systematic inflation in West Bengal's offical figures from the mid-1960s until the late 1970s, reflecting an optimistic assessment in certain official quarters as to the impact of 'green revolution' development strategies. In recent years the official series has been restored to the objective statistical basis. The effect is to bias growth rate estimates upwards in the pre-1975 period, and then to create a misleading impression of an alarming deceleration in output growth in recent years. Fortunately, the objective sample survey and crop cut estimates are available for the years in question, permitting the reconstruction of a more realistic agricultural output series. This is done in the present paper. Whereas the official series suggests that agricultural growth in West Bengal has slackened in recent years, the reconstructed time series indicates that it may have improved. The West Bengal case illustrates the importance of close attention to the methodology by which official estimates of agricultural output are prepared, and points to a more general need for caution in the use of such statistics.||James K.

28/7/1984- ||review of political economy, july 1984||4373466||The Transition from Feudalism to Capitalism||Marx warned against a straightforward application of his conclusions in "Capital" to experiences outside western Europe. Marx's method of understanding historical development is tied to many different considerations of structures and processes. This is evident in the debate regarding the transition from feudalism to capitalism. The main features of this debate are presented here, especially the recent contribution of Robert Brenner which reveals significant variations in the patterns of feudal-capitalist transition in western Europe. The development of capitalism in Europe has implications of global significance. The universalistic urges of capitalism that Marx noted led to imperialism with all its variations of uneven development. Here, for marxists, the central issue is one of moving beyond capitalism from an odd mix pre-capitalist and capitalist features. In this context, the essay raises certain questions about the marxist theory and practice of transition in the context of a class struggle which builds upon the co-operative and communitarian potential of the toiling peasantry.||Asok Sen

20/10/1984-27/10/1984||special articles||4373698||The Debate on Imperialism Just before Lenin||A new discussion on Lenin's "Imperialism" seems to be starting in various parts of the world. In his paper "Towards a Correct Reading of Lenin's Theory of Imperialism" published in this journal, A K Bagchi has criticised previous debates and raised some central points on the relationship between colonialism and imperialism; on Rosa Luxemburg's contribution; on the composite nature of mónopoly capital; on the export of capital; and on the national liberation struggles and Lenin's contribution. Second, since the first two volumes of F Braudel's "Civilisation and Capitalism" are now available in English, the reader can fully appreciate the remarks on the general significance of Lenin's theses on monopoly capitalism with which the French historian concludes "Afterthoughts on Material Civilisation and Capitalism" (The John Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, 1977). Third, from North America may be singled out S K Holloway's recent "Relations among Core Capitalist States: The Kautsky-Lenin Debate Reconsidered" (Canadian Journal of Political Science, June 1983) in which the famous debate is taken as a point of reference for a discussion of current Marxist literature on the theory of the state. In this note an old problem comes up: Kautsky's articles on imperialism are not available in English. The English speaking reader can only rely on general books like G Steenson, "K Kautsky, 1854-1938: Marxism in Classic Years" (Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh University Press, 1978) and M Salvadori, "K Kautsky and the Socialist Revolution" (London, New Left Books, 1979). However, Kautsky's contribution on imperialism is essential also for a better understanding of Lenin's work. This is the road that the present paper (translated from Italian by Mark Eaton) tries to open up. The paper which draws on the first part of the author's book "La teoria economica di Lenin" (Roma-Bari, Laterza, 1981) summarises and interprets Kautsky's work from within the contemporary debate in the workers' movement at the 1914 turning point in history, with the aim of anatomising Kautsky's orthodox and centrist view on the working and the perspectives of capitalism. Finally, in a post-script the author briefly raises some critical questions that come out of this discussion. [This paper is published in two parts. The second part will appear next week.]||L.

Can these diversities be reconciled? Can wage payments in the various markets be brought under general principle? The present state of wage theory is discussed in this light in the first part of this paper. Dealing with wage policy in the second part of the paper, the author argues for control of wages and for the introduction of a positive wage policy. He suggests appointment of a National Wage Commission which should be entrusted with the task of modelling the entire structure of wages and salaries in the country and devising an income's policy, as an adjunct to a wages and salaries policy.||A.

01/12/1984- ||special articles||4373823||Devolution Criteria: From Gamble to Policy||The strength of the Indian Centre-State fiscal system is that it provides mechanisms in the Finance and Planning Commissions which can redistribute national resources between the Centre and the states and amongst the latter in the light of the twin considerations of ability and need. The weakness has been that in the actual working of the two Commissions there has been a lack of both clarity and co-ordination in regard to ways in which each Commission could address itself to upgrading ability while responding to needs and, concurrently and conversely, compensate for backwardness while upgrading ability. This paper seeks to outline an approach to deal with this problem. The paper is divided into three sections. The first section contains an evaluation of the criteria used by successive Finance Commissions and currently by the Planning Commission in mediating resource transfers from the Centre to the states. Based on the critique in the first section, the second explores the lines along which a practical and logical approach could be evolved for devolution. The third section seeks to translate this approach into a devolution formula that could be adopted by Finance Commissions and proceeds to sketch a complementary policy for Plan transfers.||S. Guhan

The author argues that it is the rural Jat Sikh landlords, particularly from the Malwa region, who control the Akali Dal and the SGPC. The agitation led by the Akali Dal reflects a number of underlying tensions: the Jat Sikhs' feeling of receiving inadequate returns for their farm output; the Akali leadership's frustration at being out of power; the fear of both the Sikh fundamentalists and the Akali leadership of the Sikhs being pushed into a minority position within Punjab by immigration of Hindu migrant labourers and emigration of Sikhs to foreign countries; the conflict of interests between the Jat Sikh landlords on the one hand and the Sikh agricultural labourers, the scheduled and lower castes on the other; and the conflict of interest between the Bhapa Sikhs and Hindus in the urban areas as well as between the Hindu traders and the Jat Sikh peasants.||Gopal Singh

It tries to provide a catalogue of whatever scanty literature is available on the subject and develops suitable guidelines for building up an efficient fertiliser information network. It highlights the necessity of developing a number of sub-systems which would project a complete picture of the fertiliser marketing scenario when viewed in an interdependent framework.||Uttam Gupta

On the basis of the preferential treatment shown by the government the owners of small-scale units may be divided into a 'new' class, i e, the educated, and others who are mostly traditional entrepreneurs from trading and rich peasant backgrounds. This paper, based on data for Orissa, seeks to examine the performance of the new class vis-a-vis the others. Such an exercise is expected to provide useful information on the government policy which claims to attract scientific talent into entrepreneurship.||Gopinath Pradhan

It is in the these initiatives at the grass-roots, taking place generally outside the governmental and bureaucratic structures and away from the normal political processes of parties and elections, that another approach to rural development is becoming manifest. However vague their conception of the alternatives and however internally inconsistent their programmes might appear to the onlooker, they all share a common perception about the nature and sources of the misery of the 'left out' as a consequence of the prevailing model of development.||D.

Firstly, the demarcating line between small and big capital had to be defined in a way that was both administratively easy to handle and captured in an acceptable manner the essential difference between 'small' and 'large' across a wide range of industries. Secondly, ways had to be devised to ensure against the entry of ineligible persons or conglomerates to the special provisions of the the development schemes. This paper assesses the success of the Government's efforts in these directions.||Nasir Tyabji

Such an examination is of special relevance in view of the fragility of the current international financial system, the hardening of the attitudes in the developed countries concerning multilateral aid in general and provision of financing for the multilateral development banks, in particular, the general stalemate in the North-South dialogue, and the urgent need to fill gaps in development financing. Assessing the role of the ADB requires a prior examination of its structure (section II) and operations (section III). Such an examination not only indicates the role that the ADB has played since its inception but also provides indications of the role which it is likely to play in the future. Since the focus of the paper is on financial aspects, the last section assesses the extent to which the ADB has met financing needs for development, and the extent to which it is likely to do so in the future.||Mukul G.

Ever since the Karnataka Village Panchayats and Local Boards Act 1959 came into being, successive governments have been either unable or unwilling to even amend that Act - let alone anything more drastic - so as to confer real powers and resources on panchayati raj institutions at different tiers. Following the report of the Kondaji Basappa Committee in 1963, a Bill was introduced in 1964 to establish a three-tier structure. The Bill was referred to a joint select committee of the Legislature. The select committee enthusiastically recommended enhanced powers for the panchayati raj institutions, but nothing came out of it since the then government and the ruling party were not prepared for such an experiment. The Janata government has now displayed some political will in actually coming up with a proposal. This paper attempts a review of the lengthy Bill, consisting of fifteen chapters and over three hundred clauses.||B. K. Chandrashekar

The author contends that women's participation not only played often a decisive role, but that considering the specific existential conditions in the hill region it was easier for women to perceive the need for preserving the ecological balance in the area. However, the mobilisation of women for the cause of preserving forests has brought about a situation of conflict regarding their own status in society-demand for sharing in the decision-making process-and men's opposition to this and to women's support for Chipko movement. The study is based on investigation in Chamoli district in Garhwal division.||Shobhita Jain

There has also been intense competition amongst state governments in the location of Central public sector industries. However the establishment of a large number of major industrial projects in less developed regions has not had any significant impact on the industrial or overall economic growth of these regions and has thus failed in achieving the regional redistributive objective of Central policy. This paper examines the linkages of a large industrial plant located in an industrially backward state of India with a view to evaluating the efficacy and limitations of industrial locations in promoting regional economic growth.||M.

Government foodstocks, world food prices and government policies all provide hope that a famine on the scale of 1974 will be averted. There are, nevertheless, signs of unusual distress in some parts of the countryside. This paper compares the current situation with events in 1974, the last severe famine in Bangladesh, in an attempt to provide forewarning, and therefore the potential for better management, of disaster, It identifies a tendency for governments to exaggerate the proximate causes of famine in 'natural' disaster and then to underestimate the subsequent indications of famine. This paper also reiterates the inevitable partiality of relief measures in circumstances where the most influential social groups stand to gain land, assets and influence during such social crises as famine. More effective relief measures could be ensured by allowing recipient group decisive representation in relief implementation committees. But the paper recognises that such a suggestion is utopian.||Ben Crow

On the contrary, such induction can be of great value and benefit to the country in making the political-administrative process more efficient and effective. Let us not, the author argues, assume an adversary role for manager-technocrats in the political process when it could be one of synergy.||S. K. Bhattacharyya

29/9/1984- ||special articles||4373623||Liquidity, Prices and Growth: A Note||This note tries to outline briefly a theoretical framework for analysing the interaction between the monetary and the real sectors of an economy like ours. This framework differs both from the Keynesian and the monetarist ones. In contrast to the Keynesian framework it asserts that the mode of financing of government spending does matter and not only insofar as it gives rise to larger or smaller flows of capitalist consumption. A given profile of government spending financed by larger budgetary deficits puts not only larger profits in private hands, but even if those profits do not normally find their way into larger private investment or consumption expenditure flows, they boost the liquidity in the system which in certain periods or phases leads to greater hoarding and more pronounced speculative price increases. In contrast to monetarism, the framework developed here asserts that even though liquidity in the system matters, (i) its genesis and consequences are bound up with macro-distribution shifts, and (ii) it matters even when there is no 'natural rate of unemployment' or 'natural rate of growth'. Indeed the objective of the exercise is to link the question of liquidity with a dynamic model where there are independent investment functions.||Prabhat Patnaik,Amal Sanyal

In these economies one finds capitalist islands amidst a large, pre-capitalist subsistence sector; but the islands remain stagnant, or grow at a very slow rate, having no impact on the size and structure of the pre-capitalist sector. One possible explanation of this paradoxical situation is that there are sterile activities in these economies which are more profitable from the capitalists' point of view than organising production in the islands. This paper presents an analytical framework to discuss the interaction between productive and sterile activities. In particular a consistent way of calculating and comparing the rates of return in the two activities is attempted. On the basis of such comparison, the situation in which the sterile activity may expand at the cost of the productive activity is analysed.||Ajit K. Chowdhury,Kalyan K. Sanyal

This lends significance to analysis of the net impact of farm mechanisation on prospective wage income of the rural population. Some issues related to farm mechanisation and also the consequences of farm mechanisation are examined in this paper. The course and progress of farm mechanisation with special reference to some of its determinants in the context of selected Asian countries are first reviewed. Some of the emerging trends in rural labour markets affecting the terms and conditions of wage employment in these countries are then looked at. The latter aspect is sought to be examined as being the possible outcome of the ongoing mechanisation in the countries under review.||A. V. Jose

14/1/1984- ||special articles||4372842||Reality and Realism: Indian Women as Protagonists in Four Nineteenth Century Novels||It is a critical platitude to say that the Indian novel has a derivative form, imitated from the West. This is only superficially true. A form cannot be superimposed on a culture where there is no appropriate ethos to sustain its content. The reality of the Indian social situation had to be bent to suit the exigencies of realism. The realistic novel came into existence when the tension between the individual and the society acquired a certain intensity. If the social transformation of the nineteenth century had not set in motion certain dialectic forces among the English-educated class, the novel in its realistic form would not have taken roots in India. This paper seeks to isolate some of the attempts to reconcile reality and realism that mark the nineteenth century creative imagination. The paper discusses four novels, all written in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, to analyse different aspects of this problem. Widely different in theme and technique, these novels have some common features: they were written by major novelists in each of the languages; the protagonists are women though the writers are not; they deal with contemporary society or with a period within living memory; and they are realistic in intention.||Meenakshi Mukherjee

However, unless a theoretical problematique is located within empirical analysis, it would remain irrelevant for economic development and political movement. It is necessary, therefore, to understand the evolution of existing forms of land tenures and property relations which form the substratum for changes in technology and forms of labour to act upon or interact with. The present study of agrarian change and class formation in the Sindh province is part of an attempt to piece together and analyse the empirical facts concerning the transformation of agrarian structures taking place in Pakistan.||Feroz Ahmed

25/2/1984- ||special article||4372990||Politics and Organisations of Urban Workers||The working class is central to the process of social transformation. It is the only class capable of abolishing capitalism. Abolition of capitalism requires the abortion of commodity production. Only worker-controlled collectivised production to fulfil social needs can abolish commodity production. Collectivised production alone can form the material basis of participatory democracy. And only worker-controlled collectivisation of production can bring about changes in other sectors of production. Workers alone can give the lead in this process of transformation. This statement does not, however, resolve the actual problems of the workers' movement. Democratic organs of the workers cannot today survive. Stability is their main concern, at production points and in residential areas. This is not a technical problem. It requires a re-examination of many concepts. The nature of the working class itself has to be properly grasped and its consciousness understood concretely.||Sandeep Pendse

30/6/1984- ||review of agriculture, june 1984||4373352||Irrigation and Rural Development: A Sceptical View||A study of the impact of irrigation in terms of a comparison of output and income from irrigated and dry plots within a holding, or irrigated and dry holdings within a village, is likely to give an exaggerated picture of its role. The approach here instead is through a comparison across villages, because irrigation should be expected to have an impact on the development of the village as a whole including its weaker sections. The impact of irrigation even in terms of stabilisation of yields and increased cropping intensity was found to be less than expected, and it also had an opportunity cost in terms of parts of holdings left idle, suggesting that reliance only on a 'technocratic strategy' is not enough. The impact in terms of improving the incomes and quality of life, particularly of the poor, was not significant, and sometimes even dampening. On the other hand, the presence of rural industry had a much stronger positive impact in this respect, particularly in reducing poverty. However, within the given agrarian structure, even rural industry could not go far in reducing poverty since inequality was also exacerbated in the process, and the magnitude of poverty that still remained even with rural industry, was staggering enough. A survey of 15 villages in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, offering a diversity of rural situations, forms the basis of this study.||M. V. Nadkarni

There are three possible hypotheses that may explain this situation. First, economic change might have caused the technological and occupational structure of the economy to undergo a transformation biased in favour of males. Second, the Indian economic scene, featured by growing unemployment and sluggish growth of income per head, had failed to provide sufficient opportunity or incentive to attract many of the potential workers, most of them female. Third, the sex ratio may have undergone a change. This paper seeks to test these hypotheses and to measure their relative strength with an attempted framework of decomposition analysis.||Bahnisikha Ghosh,Sudhin K. Mukhopadhyay

10/3/1984- ||special articles||4373036||Distribution of Welfare: People's Housing Scheme in Karnataka||This study, seeking to evaluate the People's Housing Scheme in Karnataka as a public welfare measure, focuses on the dynamics of implementation and its impact on the socio-political structure. Concentrating on two villages in Bangalore district, it seeks to examine whether (a) the scheme meets its stated objective of providing subsidised houses to the poorest, and (b) whether it reinforces or weakens the rural social structure. Based on questionnaires canvassed and personal interviews with the state and local bureaucracy and locally elected leaders on the one hand and the villagers on the other, the study concludes that when viewed in a dynamic perspective, the scheme appears to have failed as a welfare measure. The very provisions of the scheme and the manner of its implementation were such that the scheme not merely failed to provide subsidised houses to the poorest but has in the process reinforced rather than mitigated structural and social inequalities. With the major implementors coming from the rural elite, the scheme was used as free patronage to further social control in one village and to reap monetary gains, in the other. The study recommends that unless the poorest themselves are adequately represented on the implementing machinery, it would be difficult for such schemes to succeed as public welfare measures. This paper is being published in two parts. Part I discusses the intent behind the housing scheme, its implementation and the background of the beneficiaries. Part II, which will be published next week, discusses the implications of the scheme for the social structure of the villages under study.||Mira Bakhru

They reach the conclusion that "contrary to a view held in some circles, official monetary-credit policy has on the informal credit market". The 'some circles', presumably refers, inter alia, to an earlier paper by the present authors wherein, while discussing the implications of the large volume of liquid wealth arising from cumulation of savings out of black income, they noted that "this liquidity is immune to any monetary fiscal policy", which is quoted by Acharya and Madhur, but also went on to state that "it can move round in the economy creating unpredictable excess demand in several vulnerable sectors of the economy". Given the intrinsic importance of the question the authors here carry out a closer scrutiny of both the Acharya-Madhur 'Model' and the "systematic empirical evidence" marshalled by them.||K.

The EGS is, however, the only programme that has been implemented intensively on a state-wide basis for such a long duration. Besides, it is unique as it recognises the right of the rural umemployed to get unskilled manual work on demand. It thus has a number of important lessons for employment generation and anti-poverty programmes as well as rural development in general. This paper examines the provisions of the Scheme and discusses some of the important issues involved in its planning and implementation which have a bearing on the realisation of its objectives.||S.

04/2/1984- ||special articles||4372918||Technical Change in Public Sector Steel Industry||Many factors have been held to be responsible for the sorry state of the country's public sector steel industry which completed its twenty-fifth year last month: the constraint of market on account of industrial recession, infrastructural bottlenecks of non-availability of power, problems of raw material quality and supply, the state of industrial relations and organisational inefficiency of public sector managers. This is, however, far from being the whole story. The dynamic character of technology and industrial leadership are in fact more fundamental for the long run development of an industry. Capacity utilisation and profit performance are not the only, or even most important, indicators of such dynamism; more basic is the growth of factor productivity through technical change, innovation of new products and expansion of capacities as warranted by the growth of the market. The deficiency of public sector organisation of production in a heavy industry like steel lies fundamentally in the lack of this dynamism. This paper discusses some of the interrelated problems of technical change and industrial organisation in the sphere of public sector production in this country, with special reference to the public sector steel industry.||Ramprasad Sengupta

There is no area in the entire gamut of fertiliser production, consumption or imports which is left untouched in one way or the other by the impact of various policy decisions of the government. Be it fertiliser production, distribution, marketing or promotion, government's ubiquitous role is clearly visible in every facet. This paper attempts a discussion on some of the important policies and programmes of the government and their influence on fertiliser marketing in the country.||H. K. Lakshman Rao,P. Jayaraman

The various changes observed over the period 1961-81 in terms of the distribution of the workforce by type/size and location of enterprise conform to the broad pattern of industrial development that appears to be emerging: on the one hand, a pattern of agglomerated growth based on capital-intensive, large-scale units in which the old centres of industrial concentration still dominate both in terms of employment and other characteristics; and, on the other, a greater dispersal of small units in the rural areas and small towns which has led to the emergence of certain new centres of industrial growth such as in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi, Haryana and Gujarat.||Mridul Eapen

On the contrary, strong doubts can be raised about the very existence of a functional relationship between these two variables. Consequently, it is here argued that land productivity differentials, in order to be properly explained, ought not to be analysed in the restrictive size-productivity framework; they should not, moreover, be apprehended from pooled or aggregated data.||Pol Barbier

Their contemporary counterparts have replaced the concept of tribe by that of ethnic group and use it with equal facility for either a tribe, a nationality or a nation. This underlines their reluctance, not just inability to understand African social development and its historically changing character. This paper, therefore, takes as its starting point the presentation of the three concepts of tribe, nationality and nation and argues that what are termed tribes in Africa today are really nationalities; so formed by the advent of colonialism. The paper further argues that the nationality question requires concrete and historical analysis because it has a changing historical and class character. Taking Uganda as a case study the author analysis over time the interests and stance of each class vis-a-vis the nationality question in Uganda.||Mahmood Mamdani
08/12/1984- ||special articles||4373850||Politics of Agrarian Unrest in UP Who Co-Opted Whom?||After World War I, the Indian National Congress changed from being an essentially middle-class political organisation concerned with constitutional reforms to a mass-based nationalist movement intent on ending colonial rule. For this it became necessary for the Congress to link itself with the agrarian movement. The two separate strands of social upheaval-the nationalist and the agrarian-overlapped. This paper examines this encounter between peasant and nationalist from the vantage of Eastern UP, focusing primarily on Faizabad district and districts immediately contiguous to it. For there, as the twenties dawned, a remarkable conjuncture occurred between a peasantry which had lapsed into civil disorder because major segments of it had lost faith in the agrarian system, and a Gandhiised Congress which was pursuing civil disobedience because it had come to believe that this weapon gave unarmed Indians their best chance to successfully challenge the suzerainty of a well-armed and firmly entrenched colonial master. What ensued as these two separate strands of social upheaval gradually discovered each other provides a wealth of sociological insight into how nationalist political organisations in what we now call the Third World were shaped as much by forces over which they had limited control as by those which they explicitly commanded.||Harold A.

It forms part of a larger system of equations which together constitute a macro-econometric model of the Indian economy. The focus of the study is on the price-quantity adjustment mechanism in Indian industry with specific attention to the role of government policies and international trade in the determination of output and prices. Since there has been considerable diversity in the behaviour of the different constituents of the industrial sector in India, the model is constructed in a disaggregated four-sector framework classified on the basis of end-use: consumer goods, capital goods, basic goods and intermediate goods. Section II of the paper discusses the structure of the model and its properties; section III reports on sources of data and related problems; sections IV and V discuss the estimated structure and the quantitative implications; and sectionVI presents a summary of the conclusions.||Ashok Kumar Lahiri,Srinivasa Madhur,Dipankar Purkayastha,Prannoy Roy

This monocausal explanation does not seem to be quite valid when some more advanced countries are considered. In countries like India the gradual maturing of the industrialisation process has resulted in the development of modern technology by the local firms in some sectors of the economy. These countries are thus faced with choosing between indigenous sources of technology and transnational corporations. The exercise of this choice, however, seldom results in moving these countries out of a relationship of dependence on the developed countries. This raises the pertinent question of how the selection of technology is done in these countries. The present paper seeks to bring out, through a case study from the fertiliser industry in India, the process of selection of technology, the criteria that were adopted for selection and the objective basis of these criteria. Further, it tries to show the implications of choosing an imported technology in preference to one that had been developed by Indian firms.||Biswajit Dhar

The latter requires not only the imposition of import duties which may be adequate to make, say, Indian steel competitive with imported steel within India but also to subsidise steel exports to the degree necessary to reduce the cost of Indian steel to the level at which Indian steel becomes competitive in the market outside India. The ideal solution for promoting economic development thus appears to be the adoption of a dual exchange rate, it is argued in this paper.||Nicholas Kaldor

The Small Farmers' Development Agencies and the Marginal Farmers' and Agricultural Labourers Agencies have failed to really reach this segment of the population to fulfil their developmental needs. Nevertheless, it has been found that wherever inputs have been connected to small/marginal farmers, productivity on their lands has been far superior to that on others - owing to the intensity of their labour and the economy of their farming input practices. Irrigation is one of the pre-requisites for any major improvement in land productivity. This paper describes some successful experiments with community tubewells in East UP and North Bihar. It underscores that institutional factors as much as financial investments are important in determining the success of these ventures.||Niranjan Pant

It is for this reason probably that studies which demonstrate the malleability of the caste structure and beliefs remain at the level of case studies and have not been able to provide an alternative conspectus on the issue of castes at a general level. The purpose of this paper is to suggest an alternative conceptual formulation on castes which can fully integrate many of the empirical findings.

Incorporation of the stock variable is an innovation in the analysis of commodity price movements, specifically those of an agricultural raw material. The main findings of the paper are that the natural rubber market underwent an important change after 1973-74, whereby uncertainty and instability have increased markedly and have been exacerbated by ad hoc import and export policies. These policies have been influenced by short-term considerations and pressure of lobbies of rubber product manufacturers and natural rubber growers. The need for a more rational approach to price stabilisation through buffer stocks is thus clearly indicated.||Sunil Mani

Since the small farmers were left out from the levy obligations, whatever this category's marketed surplus, it could get the benefit of a higher open market price. Because of the subsidy element, the food deficit areas have received an indirect income transfer from the Central government. Further, consumers depending on open market purchases (very often the quality conscious higher income groups), have contributed partially towards the ration income of consumers who purchase foodgrains from the fair price shops. While in the long run a lasting solution for poverty is to provide increased employment and income opportunities for the poor, in the short run a consumer-oriented food subsidy system could be a viable approach for increasing the nutritional status of the poor. Even within this framework, effective management of purchases, sales, imports and stocks could reduce the government subsidy.||P. S. George

This is followed by a review of the legislative and administrative decisions taken during the seventies, again under the Congress regime which were very radical in content, but were not meant to be implemented. The programme of the Left Front government after 1977 with respect to the sharecroppers, with particular reference to the controversial programme of Operation Barga, is then examined. Finally, a number of issues raised by the critics of Operation Barga are reviewed and likely future trends are discussed.||Biplab Dasgupta
31/3/1984- ||review of agriculture, march 1984||4373108||Rural Women and High Yielding Variety Rice Technology||The absence of gender analysis in the vast body of literature on the socio-economic implications of the new agricultural strategy reflects uncritical acceptance of the assumption that the household is a unit of converging (perhaps even homogenous) interests, wherein the benefits or burdens of technological change will be shared equally by all members. This paper questions this assumption and focuses attention on some of the implications of HYV rice technology on women of different socio-economic classes. Consideration of the impact on women of the poorest households in particular is seen as important, because many of these women are the primary or sole income-earners in their families and their access to employment and income is crucial for their own and their families' survival. The primary thrust of the paper is on a quantitative assessment of the impact of HYV rice on the nature and extent of involvement in field-related work of women and men belonging to different classes of households, in three principal rice-growing states, viz, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Orissa. The paper is divided into four sections. Section II contains an empirical analysis of the impact of HYV rice on female labour use in field-related agricultural work. The impact is disaggregated by different categories of labour (family, permanent and casual) and by different farm size groups. Section III brings together illustrative material which throws light on the noted or expected implications of HYV rice technology on women's overall work burden (including the burden of non-field related agricultural and other work) and on their income and consumption. A brief summary and concluding comments are presented in Section IV.||Bina Agarwal

It is for this reason probably that studies which demonstrate the malleability of the caste structure and beliefs remain at the level of case studies and have not been able to provide an alternative conspectus on the issue of castes at a general level. The purpose of this paper is to suggest an alternative conceptual formulation on castes which can fully integrate many of the empirical findings. [This is the third and final part of the paper.

In the first part of this paper the author seeks to identify the factors responsible for this situation. Trends in area, yield, production, prices and farm incomes of the oilseeds economy are dealt with. The aims and achievements of the oilseeds 'growers' co-operatives recently started by the NDDB are also discussed. In part II of this paper two models-one recursive and the other seasonal, an improvement on the first-for making short-term price forecasts are presented. The author contends that despite limitations the models on the whole provide a better understanding of the edible oil and oilseed system in broad terms.||M. L. Jhala

While many factors may have contributed to this outcome, it is argued that the role played by the prevailing orientation and process of planning in this regard deserves special attention. A superficial reading of the Indian experience with poverty alleviation programmes may lead one to the conclusion that increased central planning and control of those programmes are urgently required. A careful analysis, however, would show that a move in the opposite direction is in fact the need of the hour.||Samuel Paul

This paper, before proceeding to undertake such a review, presents a summary of the corporate tax system and a survey of studies relating to the pattern of corporate finance and its impact on capital formation. The recent trends in corporate financing pattern and domestic capital formation are also analysed in Section II. The next section studies the major distortions and deficiencies in the corporate capital structure and in capital formation arising out of tax provisions. Finally, the necessary reforms and a suitable corporate tax base are considered.||C. S. Balasubramaniam

The performance of individual industries in the capital goods sector could no doubt be affected by factors specific to them. It is, however, shown here that there are certain broad macro factors which have a causal bearing on the performance of the sector as a whole. This paper seeks to capture, what the author considers, the crucial macro relationships in the economy which influence the performance of the capital goods sector in India.||R. Ramana

Documenting the course of real wages can, therefore, shed useful light on trends in incomes of the rural poor, the extent of rural poverty and the distribution of rural income. This paper puts together continuous series for money and real wages of agricultural workers in Bangladesh for the three decades ending in 1980. It then attempts an analysis of the causes of variations in real wages over this period. Later in the paper, with a view to looking at the problem in a longer historical perspective, some rudimentary facts are assembled on the course of real wages in Bangladesh agriculture at some points of time spread over the very long period of a century and a half.||A.

The internal shifts in the nature, orientation and location of communal riots bear testimony to this. While communal tensions have traditionally been viewed as an indicator of the breakdown of the system, this analysis suggests that they are actually a sign of its dynamism and the 'secular' changes that are taking place in it as a result of economic development. Similarly, far from being an illogical and irrational complex of actions, communal rioting is a clearly directed, goal-oriented social action whose logic and rationality are clear to those who engage in it. Communal tensions understood as tensions between Hindus and Muslims do not necessarily constitute a distinct category of tensions to be distinguished from other forms of civil strife. Deeper social processes are at work throughout Indian society and are producing an unusual exacerbation not only of communal tensions but all varieties of social and civil conflicts and tensions.||Imtiaz Ahmed

The two-pronged strategy to be adopted for this purpose will consist of: (i) Reducing rapidly our dependence on fossil-fuel energy sources and (ii) turning increasingly to technologies that blossom from renewable sources of energy. Policy-makers and experts, e g, in India, seem to see the validity of the strategy. But numerous ailemmas have in practice obliged Third World countries like India to set themselves in the opposite direction, so that the dependence on fossil-fuel, energies, far from being reduced, is destined to increase uninterruptedly at least up to the year 2000 AD. The Paper brings to surface underlying compulsions in several areas such as industrialisation, electricity, rural energy and energy conservation, and in relation to some economic, social, defence-oriented and political factors. These show the immense practical difficulties being faced in bringing short-term economic policy measures in line with the correct perception of long-term energy strategies. The Paper draws on Indian conditions and experiences and concludes with a few comments on international elements of energy strategies and suggestions for short-term implementation.||D. R. Pendse

Thirdly, will the Finance Minister's expectations about tax compliance materialise? And, finally, what is likely to be the total effect on the tax liability of the assessees?

These advances open up entirely new possibilities. The advanced countries have formulated their strategies to meet the new challenges both at the governmental and private levels. Countries like India, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Pakistan and the Phillipines have also made some, if by comparison feeble, attempts at organising their efforts in this area. International aid-giving organisations and UN agencies have also joined in these activities and have identified programmes of work and projects to be undertaken. An attempt has been made in this paper to outline the strategies followed by Japan in this area. The authors discuss the strategies followed by the Japanese government and industries, the present status of biotechnology research in Japan in the agricultural and pharmaceutical areas, the international policy of Japan in regard to biotechnology research and the relevance of the Japanese experience to India.||C.

How did this happen and why? In their attempts at explaining Parsi success, sociologists and economic historians of diverse schools have highlighted the Parsis' religious work ethic, their special minority position, their lack of caste prejudices, their production-oriented peasant-artisan background and, above all, their acceptability to British patrons as stable collaborators. In two earlier papers in this journal, the present writer too had made an attempt to come to grips with these issues within a specific chronological frame. Here, as the title of the paper suggests, he surveys a much longer period and examines the case of the Parsis more thoroughly in its wider national context, with reference to three distinct phases of the community's development. The objective is to understand it more in terms of the productive forces and relations inherent in the situation, both intra-societal and extra-societal, rather than of ethnic qualities, value systems or other factors that are purely external.||Amalendu Guha

Second, can one discern trends in the structure of the work force-in particular, has there been any evidence of a relative shift away from agriculture? Apart from the all-India picture, these questions are posed at the state level as well.||J. Krishnamurty

The ability of the state to do so however is itself limited. The market question therefore gets linked to the ability of the state to generate enough resources to maintain the tempo of its own investment. This ability in turn is determined by the play of class forces in the economy - by the fact that the state is constrained both to increase proportionately the share of the economic surplus going into the hands of the propertied rich and, at the same time, to alleviate somewhat the impact of inflation, at least upon the salariat and the organised workers.||Prabhat Patnaik

The rapid growth of the number of institutions offering both degree and non-degree programmes in management has been one response to this critical need. Research on the role of these programmes in the diffusion of innovative technologies has revealed that (i) the 'climate' of employing organisations and (ii) specific characteristics of such training programmes affect greatly the rate or extent to which trained managers introduce improved methods in their job settings. Studies carried out in 1968 and 1981 to evaluate the impact of such management education institutions provide data on change over time in these specific factors. The findings show that, while advanced management methods are more widely practised in business and industry, the climate in organisations is less supportive of innovation than before. Findings also show that certain important characteristics of the educational programmes in three select management education institutions are less conducive to innovative effort than in 1968. The implications of these findings are explored in this paper.||Howard J. Baumgartel,Rukhsana Pathan,Badal Roy,Gopal Khandelwal,Anisur Rahman

Sraffa was continuously engaged in a two-fold task in economic theory: to develop a basic critique of the marginalist theory that had gained dominance after the 1870s and to elucidate and reconstruct the long-submerged approach to theory of the classical writers. Both tasks demanded an astute understanding of the history of theory. On the one hand, a clear perception of the conceptual and logical structure of alternative theories was required; and, on the other, an appreciation of the transitions that occur in the dominant mainstream theory whereby one approach is abandoned, sometimes prematurely, and another established. Sraffa was not, however, one of those scholars who can barely breathe outside the ivory tower. His commitment to socialism, formed in his youthful years, remained unshaken and steadfast until his last, although his generation was one in which Marxists experienced tremendous vicissitudes.||Krishna Bharadwaj

A large number of managers, the author finds, consider ordinary share capital as the most expensive and long-term debt as the least expensive. The low cost of debt due to tax deductibility of interest and the complicated procedures for raising equity capital are found to be responsible for the strong preference for borrowing.||I. M. Pandey

Emmanuel's thesis runs counter to the traditional comparative costs doctrine and the subsequent terms of trade explanation which are both analytically inadequate. He also rightly stresses the internationalisation of capital. However, Emmanuel's attempt to offer a theory of imperialism through unequal exchange in trade is not only unsatisfactory but also not sustainable - particularly in its dynamic version. This article also analyses some of the major theoretical flaws in V M Dandekar's treatment of unequal exchange in this attempt to elaborate Emmanuel's thesis particularly in the Indian context.||Krishna Bharadwaj
