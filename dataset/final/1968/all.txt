There are cleavages between the free immigrants and the descendants of indentured immigrants, between various caste, occupational and religious groups. But trade relationships, established on the basis of mutual benefit, cut through all these. Kinship ties promote co-operation as well as competition.||I. S. Chauhan

The crisis is better understood in the context of the institutional framework which iminges on the determination of National Interest. The three dimensions of this institutional framework most relevant are: (1) the federal structure of Government and the parliamentary democratic institutions of decision-making; (2) the institutionalised pattern of socio-economic growth with a mixed economy dependent on foreign loans and aid; and, (3) political pluralism operating in a competitive political system. Close scrutiny of these dimensions of the institutional framework will reveal the problems of reconciling divergences if federal consent is to be obtained, if the urgent and growing demands of a developing economy are to be satisfied without impairing national independence and compromising foreign policy and if an acceptable consensus is to be evolved through the participatory process of decision-making.||Rasheeduddin Khan
31/8/1968- ||special articles||4359003||Pricing of Oil Products: Its Economic Consequences||Adherence to the outdated formula of fixing oil prices on the basis of Persian Gulf import parity is producing a number of serious economic consequences, particularly because the country's demand for oil products is now largely fulfilled by domestic refineries at prices which bear little relationship with the pattern and location of the domestic market. Under this pricing system, an Indian refinery processing Iranian crude secures a higher refinery-margin than can be made by a refinery in the Persian Gulf, because the ocean freight for products is higher than for crude. The relative pricing of various products aggravates the product imbalance because from the viewpoint of refineries motor spirit is more attractive than middle distillates. A price system closely related to Indian conditions would make it economically worthwhile for any refinery to choose a production pattern closer to the demand structure. The profitability of refineries should, moreover, not be dependent upon the accident of geography.

From being a source of pollution, they have, through education, greater economic independence, and through enactment of laws prohibiting discrimination against them, attained a higher status in society. This higher status is evidenced by changes in behaviour patterns, modes of address, common eating and drinking - and even some cases of intermarriage with higher castes; in other words, by the near-disappearance of untouchability. In the interaction between well-to-do Pulayas and the higher castes, the change is, in fact, substantial. The inference is that untouchability is not an insurmountable barrier but the untouchables have to change their behavioural pattern and standard of living and achieve economic independence in their quest for social mobility. [This paper is based on a sample study of 450 Pulayas which the author conducted in three talukas of the former Travancore State between December 1963 and May 1964. The sample was selected from the lists of voters for village panchayat elections held in 1963.]||K. C. Alexander

18/5/1968- ||special articles||4358633||Kachcha Thivu: Background and Issues||There is no clear evidence in support of India's sovereignty over the Kachcha Thivu island. Ceylon's claims to the island rest primarily on cartographic evidence dating back several centuries, and on the fact that in recent years Ceylon has exercised effective control over the island. India's claims, on the other hand, are based primarily on the zamindari of the island exercised for a long time by the Raja of Ramnad. Legal experts on both sides would thus have enough data to indulge in hair-splitting. The island itself is a desolate, half-coral, half-sand islet, of no immediate strategic relevance. It is used mainly by fishermen to celebrate St Anthony's festival and it becomes, around that time of the year, a busy point for smuggling and illegal emigration into Ceylon - for which reason Ceylon has of late undertaken patrolling of the island area. The restraint which the Prime Ministers of both countries have introduced into their statements on the controversy augurs well for a settlement through a conference of officials. The spirit of an earlier statement on the subject by Pandit Nehru that "there is no national prestige involved in the matter, specially with our neighbour Ceylon", may therefore yet provide the key to a mutually acceptable solution.||Urmila Phadnis

Much of this poverty and consequent hunger are concentrated in rural India, particularly in areas where there is a high concentration of landless labour, where the per capita area under cultivation is small, and where productivity is low. The undernutrition is partly due to lack of purchasing power and partly due to shortage of foodgrains. The existence of the large mass of hungry population has great significance for planned economic development. Some kind of national minimum has to be provided to everyone if planning is to have meaning for the masses in general. It is important to know the areas in which the undernutrition is widespread so that planning efforts could be directed to alleviate distress there. This article seeks to measure the magnitude of undernutrition in the different States and to analyse the factors that contribute to it. Though for effective action a districtwise analysis would be more useful, the lack of required data confines the study to the State level. Also, since 90 per cent of the foodgrains consumption in India is of cereals, undernutrition is measured with reference to cereals only.||S. S. Madalgi

First, much of the apparent absenteeism is the result of poor statistics. Secondly, absenteeism indicates that the worker has become an "economic man" which is what sociologists have always wanted. Absenteeism is a consequence of the workers' new-found economic rationality: it shows that the worker can value work and leisure in monetary terms. [This paper arises out of the author's work on Manpower Planning in India at London School of Economics and Political Science. The field-work was carried out in electrical equipment and machine-tool factories in Bombay, Poona and Baroda and in Madras State during November-December 1967. The author is grateful to Y B Bhosale, Personnel Manager of Cooper Engineering, Chinchwad, Maharashtra, for originally stimulating his interest and to P K Nair of National Electrical Industries, Bombay, for permission to quote from his thesis.

09/11/1968- ||special articles||4359290||Investment in Agriculture||In the poorer economies, investment in agriculture has been observed to vary with co-operative inputs like labour and land. Also, the investment pattern is broadly characterised by three stages. In the first stage, increased investment by the State leads also to a spurt in private investment, though the latter cannot keep pace with public sector investment. In the second, implements and bullocks dwindle in importance for new investment, and fertilisers and other infrastructure items like credit provision and research extension assume greater importance. In the third stage, labour becomes the critical factor, is scarce, and has to be substituted. The Indian economy is thus largely in the second stage of agricultural investment.||Tara Shukla

17/2/1968- ||special articles||4358265||Competitiveness of India's Tea Exports||An attempt is made here to examine the net impact of the devaluation of the Rupee in 1966 and the more recent devaluations of the British Pound and the Ceylon Rupee on the competitiveness of India's tea exports. Indian tea exports benefited considerably from the devaluation of the Rupee. Though the major portion of the Rupee gain arising from the devaluation was appropriated by the Government through export duties and by the trade through higher margins, it is possible that the improvement in India's tea exports in 1967 was partly at least due to the small competitive reduction in the external prices of Indian tea made possible by the devaluation of the rupee. But this advantage was drastically reduced by the devaluation of the Pound. Further, the devaluation of the Ceylon Rupee by 20 per cent - or by 5.7 per cent more than the devaluation of the British Pound - will put Indian teas under pressure. In the circumstances the Government would be making a grievous error if it does not take timely action to restore the competitiveness of Indian teas. [This article was written before the announcement on February 6 of the cut in export duty on tea.]||I. S. Gulati

Defining taxable capacity as the excess of net income from agriculture over subsistence requirement, the author estimates that in 1965-66 an amount of Rs 172 crores, equal to 10 to 11 per cent of agricultural income, could have been raised through taxation of agriculture in UP. The distribution of taxable capacity among households having different sizes of land-holdings shows that 50 per cent of taxable capacity is concentrated in households whose land-holdings exceed 20 acres.||D.

05/10/1968- ||special articles||4359140||Shades of Darkness: The Annals of the Coal Industry||Technology and the consumer have been the twin victims of the interia of the coal mine-owners. As early as 1918, a British mining engineer had emphasised the urgent need of sand-stowing and the use of slack for generation of cheap power. These suggestions were effectively sabotaged, thus sanctifying the pursuit of quick and easy profits at the expense of safety and the consumer. When in 1925 there was a change from sellers' to buyers' market, the owners decided at last to bring out only what could be sold. The rest was left underground in such a state that it was not only irrecoverable at any subsequent date but was soon to provide the tinder for those eternal fires that to this day are the sightseers' delight in the Bengal-Bihar coalfields and public memorials to the rapacity of coal owners. Said the Burrows Committee in 1936: "the coal trade in India has been rather like a race in which profit has always come in first with safety a poor second, sound methods an also ran and national welfare a dead horse, entered perhaps, but never likely to start..." The Coal Mines Safety (Stowing) Act of 1939 accepted the pernicious principle of subsidising. Beginning with stowing, the principle was later extended to gas, depth, inclination, water, seam-thickness, and even transport costs from pithead to railhead. The Bhoothalingam Committee went further. Its cost-plus formula became the excuse for frequent price increases. In 1962, Government was hypnotised into believing that widening of price differentials between various grades would promote greater fuel efficiency among users. Why a similar logic could not apply to the coal industry itself was overlooked. The report of the Tariff Commission is unique for its elevation of fiction to the status of facts. The Commission's faith in the alleged urge of the industry to mechanise is misplaced. Mechanisation in Indian mines is the result of withdrawal of women workers. The so-called mechanisation far from "reducing occupational hazards of labour underground and the number of men facing these hazards" has become the most potent means for mass death, because of the crowding of green labour at the most dangerous places. India needs cheap thermal power and, therefore, cheap coal. This basic proposition is quite independent of wage increases and so-called difficult mining conditions.||K. V. Subrahmanyam

Present conditions in this field are grave, and 1966 and 1967 saw a sharp intensification of industrial conflict - not wholly attributable to the changed political climate after the last general elections. The study groups set up by the Commission have provided it with a realistic analyses of the problems involved as well as bold, practical suggestions for dealing with the problems. There is also a significant concurrence of views among the four regional study groups. Their conclusions and recommendations on important issues, however, run counter to the official policy of the past two decades. It will call for a great deal of courage and conviction on the part of the Commission to recommend a virtual reversal of past policy, especially since that policy has become a vested interest for some.||Bagaram Tulpule

The commodity items have been grouped both in traditional categories and under essential and non-essential distinguished on the basis of cross-section expenditure elasticities.

The myth of progress and equality through cheap labour and obsolete machines has long been exploded. Technological excellence and not wild subsidies will determine India's future as a trading nation. By the import of obsolete equipment, we are paying interest on other peoples' obsolescence and further widening the gap between us and the advanced countries. The attainment of parity with advanced societies can be speeded up through selective commitment of resources to the most advanced and most appropriate technologies. We should spend more time and effort in assessing the differences between the fading and the arriving technologies and determine the extent, nature and magnitude of our commitments. We must also identify the over-kill point in technology.||J. C. Kapur

II: An Indian Point of View||In the first part of this article, which appeared last week, the author sought to interpret the character of the African revolution by outlining the colonial origins of the present political divisions of Africa and by examining the African economies and their effect on African societies. In this, the second and concluding part of the article, the author discusses the Indian response to Africa. Indians, he concludes, often begin by asking the wrong question: "What can India give to Africa?". Of far greater relevance is it to seek out ways of informing ourselves better about the African situation - something which has been thwarted by the exclusive dependence hitherto on narrow diplomatic channels.||Anirudha Gupta

This may be criticised on the ground that certain cities with small population have high living costs. It would therefore be more proper to grade cities on the basis of a formula which takes into account both population and cost of living. The present study is an attempt to derive such a formula for ranking cities.||C. G. Gopal Krishna

In the thick of the dogfight, the leaders of the ruling coalition never forgot that they had to stay in power and stay together. While there is a strong odour of disenchantment with the coalition and even with E M S Namboodiripad and the Communists are deliberately neglecting the students as an expendable segment, Namboodiripad's uncanny sense of calculation can be relied upon to maintain and extend the influence of the Left Communists. It is reasonably safe to conclude that the Namboodiripad Government will live out its present term but seeking of martyrdom as an alternative to becoming unpopular through a prolonged stay in office is not altogether ruled out.||T.

He does not see any possibility of growth of bank deposits being adversely affected since he holds that deposits initially diverted from banks to non-banks would find their way back to the banking system and remain there. Actually, given the general scarcity of loanable funds and Reserve Bank restrictions on lending by commercial banks, there is a natural tendency for interest rates to rise in the uncontrolled sector and this does cut into the expansion of bank deposits. The recognition of the non-banking sector as an active competitor for deposits is, therefore, essential for adoption of policy measures to prevent progressive erosion of the importance of the banking system.||G.

This study is concerned with finding out how major factors like the total supply of cereals, demand for consumption by the non-agricultural sector and availability of monetary resources, etc, have influenced cereal prices in the past sixteen years. Prices of cereals have a short-term elasticity of -1.40 with respect to their supply in the current and previous years, a short-term elasticity of +1.41 with respect to real income in the non-agricultural sector and of +0.16 with respect to total monetary resources. The corresponding long-term elasticities are around -2.80, +2.82 and +0.32, respectively. Using the above information about the quantitative influence of the major factors on the movement of cereal prices, it becomes possible to know what their level would be in a future period given, of course, the probable levels of these major factors.

26/10/1968- ||review of agriculture, october 1968||4359233||HYVP for Rice: Performance in a Bengal District||This paper examines the record of the High-Yielding Varieties Programme for rice in Birbhum district of West Bengal. One-fifth of the State target of area to be brought under the HYVP in kharif 1968-69 is in this district. The performance of the HYVP in this district is, therefore, important not only as an indicator of the prospects for the Programme, but also from the point of view of achieving the target of additional paddy production in the State. The achievement of the HYVP is assessed here in terms of the extent to which farmers have taken to the high-yielding varieties, as well as of the excess of physical yields and financial returns from these varieties over those from the traditional varieties. Experience with the HYVP in Birbhum emphasises the importance of irrigation. High fertiliser consuming seeds, like the high-yielding varieties, require not just enough irrigation but also controlled irrigation which, in the absence of arrangements for preserving water in the village, cannot be provided by irrigation facilities which themselves depend on the monsoon. Non-availability of irrigation water also effectively neutralises one of the major advantages of the high-yielding varieties of seeds - the fact of their being quick-maturing - by limiting the scope for growing a second crop. The tenancy pattern, characterised by wide prevalence of share-cropping, is another material factor which affects the performance of the HYVP in Birbhum. Paradoxically, improved technology calling for large out-of-pocket investment, which has invariably to be financed by the owner, strengthens the position of the owner and enables him to turn the terms of tenancy against the farmer with the inevitable disincentive effects on the latter.||S.

Where the rates of fertiliser application are very low, the price factor is hardly a disincentive to the extension of fertiliser use. Where agriculture is still largely traditional, the demand curve for fertiliser input can be shifted to the right by introduction of technological change. Fertiliser consumption can be raised substantially, without touching the prices of either input or output, by introducing better methods of cultivation and by concentrating on extension work.

1/7/1968- ||planning the plan||4358803||Plan or No Plan?||Are the questions raised by the Planning Commission in its Approach to the Fourth Plan indeed the basic policy issues that call for attention? Rather than ask for a vote on the basis of one or two numbers related to growth rates, it would have been better to state the policy alternatives in terms of the constraints on growth and on the diffusion of Plan benefits in the short and long run. The basic question that has to be raised and answered in the short run is what we shall do if, as seems more than likely, the foreign aid available is inadequate for maintaining the policy of import liberalisation. The Approach document evades this problem by not raising the question at all and by drawing attention to limiting foreign aid to a prescribed amount by 1973-74, the terminal year of the Fourth Plan. To plan everything on calculations relating to the terminal year alone would appear to repeat the mistakes made both in the Second and Third Plans. To say that export promotion depends upon reduction of costs merely amounts to saying that you are on the side of the angels. Exports are not likely to make much headway unless there is a more aggressive policy of export subsidisation, such as through a dual market in foreign exchange. The author (who headed the Committee on Steel Control in 1964) feels that, if the dual market principle were applied to foodgrain and foreign exchange, a more efficient system of distribution could be devised which offers more incentives to both foodgrain producers and exporters. That a rate of growth of 5 to 6 per cent per annum can be maintained over a period of time with domestic savings of only around 12 to 13 per cent of national income appears highly improbable, particularly if dependence on foreign aid is also to be reduced. The problems of the Fourth Plan period - even those involved in a 5 per cent growth path - appear to have been underestimated by the Planning Commission. What has been secured from the National Development Council seems a rather meaningless approval of an all too broad and simplified approach.||K. N. Raj

11/5/1968- ||special articles||4358602||Greatness by Revivals: Karl Marx: The 150th Year||In contrast to the thirties and the forties, when Marx literally burst upon the Indian intelligentsia, a fair amount of solid, empirical, investigative work has now been done in various fields by Marxist scholars. This is particularly true of economic history. Without the first rapture of the thirties and the forties, the orientation which led on to the beginning of a corpus of detailed work would not perhaps have been achieved. But the negation has to be negated! There is now both ground and reason for the erection of generalisations in the grand manner of Marx himself. In the making of these generalisations a return to some of the basic theories of Marx would seem to be in order. And the 150th anniversary of his birth would be a particularly auspicious occasion to commence this effort, to make the next turn in the spiral of the integration of Marxist method with Indian reality. This would appear to be all the more important since at the level of mass action the need seems to be the widest possible spread of the basic ideas of Marx if mediaevalist obscurantism is not to spread its noxious fumes into the vacuum created by the breakdown of nationalist ideology.||Mohit Sen

17/8/1968- ||special articles||4358943||Agricultural Innovations: Leaders and Laggards||This paper analyses the time pattern of adoption of innovations in agriculture and examines the factors which help or hinder their acceptance. The study is based on an investigation of 270 rice farmers in two villages of South Kanara district of Mysore. The three important innovations are improved seeds, chemical fertilisers and the Japanese method of paddy cultivation. The various stages of decision making are grouped in three: awareness, acquaintance and adoption. The time period required to pass from awareness to acquaintance is less than that from acquaintance to adoption. The adoption period varies from innovation to innovation, being longer for improved seeds and shorter for fertilisers and the Japanese method. As between farmers, it is the larger, wealthier, more literate and younger ones who lead the innovations. The process of adoption does not appear to be one in which "innovations come in swarms" nor does their application follow a similar pattern: it is more a gradual sequence through innovators-imitators-laggards. Mass communication media can help shorten the lag between the first appearance of an innovation and farmers' awareness of it. To speed up the actual adoption, however, demonstrations and direct personal contacts of extension agencies are indispensable.||N. S. Shetty

It only describes how Metal Box of India adapted a few well known and extremely simple techniques to prepare a long term forecast of demand for its products, i e, consumer packages of different types made from tinplate, aluminium, paper and board, and plastics. The forecast covered the seven-year period from 1969-70 to 1975-76. Since the actual data used and the results obtained are confidential, only the basic approach and the methodological steps are outlined. With some modifications these should be of some use to any firm producing intermediate goods for industrial customers. The forecast could not, for obvious reasons, be compared with the actuals for any one year. However, a projection of the forecast backwards and a comparison of these projections with the actuals for the last seven years would seem to suggest that the forecast could be expected to be accurate within ± 5 per cent for the first year and ± 15 per cent for the last year of the forecasting period.||D.

The idea seems to be to rely henceforth exclusively on the estimates prepared by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. This move calls for an explanation since it was the defects in the Ministry's estimates which had prompted the Government to entrust the NSS with the task of carrying out a more scientific and independent crop survey. There is no evidence that the defects in the Ministry's estimates have since been rectified. At the same time, the NSS has in the course of the last ten years developed objective and scientific methods of estimation, trained up a field staff comprising about 2,000 investigators and inspectors and built up an experienced team for processing and analysing the data collected. To scuttle all this expertise would be a retrograde step and would leave the country without a reliable estimate of agricultural production.

But given the need to finance pre-determined amounts of government expenditure, commodity taxes are certainly less inflationary than the alternative of deficit financing. The shift of resources to the Government achieved by a budgetary deficit is not permanent in the sense that the deficit, and the consequent inflationary impulses, will have to be repeated year after year to finance a given monetary expenditure by the government, whereas in the case of a commodity tax (or any other tax) the shift of resources to government is permanent. The impact of commodity taxes on sectoral prices is, however, of significance. In a period when the demand for capital goods exceeds supply, taxes on capital goods might contribute to restraining real investment. When, on the other hand, investment is slack and capital goods industries are faced with idle capacity, withdrawal of taxes on capital goods would promote new investment activity. The economy is just now poised for a large increase in agricultural output. If the rise in real national product is not to be dissipated in higher consumption all round, it is necessary to adopt measures which will stimulate investment activity. A straight cut in taxes on capital goods could be one important such measure.||G. Narayanan

The major difference between adopters of the Olpad thresher and the rest is the greater concentration of the former on vegetable growing which requires intensive application of labour. At the same time, the proportion of workers to non-workers is lower in the families which have adopted the Olpad thresher. It is suggested in this note that it is relative scarcity of labour which has led to the use of the Olpad thresher by certain cultivators even as others have refused to adopt it. It is not, of course, implied that socio-psychological factors are not important in explaining differences in the extent of use of improved farm implements. But often a purely economic factor like differential labour shortage may be a sufficient explanation.||D. P. Chaudhuri,G. R. Saini

Even after these minimum conditions for effective planning are fulfilled, we have to build into the plan such strategic variables as the degree of boldness of fiscal and income as well as agrarian policies. Also, the private sector can be induced to do or not to do certain things, but there will be no certainty that the inducements will actually work. All this increases the already considerable margin of uncertainty inherent in long-term planning and widens the need for 'variant thinking'. This paper examines the applicability to mixed underdeveloped economies of the planning method developed by Michal Kalecki in the context of Poland and generalised in his theory of growth of socialist economies. The method has the advantage that it identifies possible difficulties and bottlenecks and makes explicit the political choices. Further, macroeconomic planning is integrated with planning at the branch level and with the planning of individual projects. Finally, explicit consideration of variants and alternatives at different stages of planning and at different levels of the economy reduces the scope for wrong investment and management decisions. [This paper draws inspiration from the ideas and methods discussed by Michal Kalecki in the following four essays, published in successive volumes of 'Essays on Planning and Economic Development' of the Centre of Research on Underdeveloped Economies, Warsaw: (1) "An Outline of a Method of Constructing a Perspective Plan"; (2) "Problems of Financing Economic Development in a Mixed Economy"; (3) "Main Differences Between Developed and Underdeveloped Capitalist Economies"; and, (4) "Determination of the Rate of Growth of a Socialistic Economy under Conditions of Unlimited Surplus Labour".]||Ignacy Sachs

The speakers of each of these dialects constitute a distinct cultural sub-group. This article examines how these sub-groups have adjusted themselves to the multilingual situation and solved the problems of communication. The study is based on a survey of college and school students, college teachers and parents in Udaipur city. The data reveal that the speakers of different Rajasthani dialects have solved the problems arising from multilingualism by turning increasingly to Hindi not only for communication with members of other dialect-groups but even within the same group. Hindi, it is found, is preferred to the mother-tongue as the medium of instruction in schools and colleges and even for communication within the family and the kin group. In this situation any attempt to evolve a common 'Rajasthani' language as the regional language for the whole State is wholly pointless. By raising the issue of the relative weightage of the different dialects in the common 'Rajasthani' language, it may reactivate tensions between the different dialect-groups and reverse the present trend towards adjustment and harmony through the use of Hindi.||S.

His estimate is, however, questionable since his estimate of base year food demand at one-third of national income is too low. And while his estimate of additional food demand is too low, his expectations of additional food production may be over-optimistic.||S. S. Madalgi

The authors conclude that some of the basic issues related to successful implementation of the Programme remain unresolved. More specifically unless vigorous extension work is organised the results expected of the High-Yielding Varieties Programme are unlikely to materialise. Supply of inputs by itself will not suffice to achieve the targets of either consumption of plant nutrients or expansion of the acreage under improved seeds.||Gokul Parikh,Surendra Saxena,Madhukar Maharaja

31/8/1968- ||review of management, august 1968||4359001||Wage Fixation by Wage Boards||There was need in the mid-fifties for a national review of the wage structure. The machinery of Industrial Tribunals and Courts was clearly inadequate for this purpose because the problems involved were not in the nature of industrial disputes. Wage Boards thus became the instruments for non-adjudicatory settlements. Their appointment received powerful but indiscriminate support from the trade union movement. The recommendations of wage boards did result in a significant upward push in wage levels, and a considerable degree of rationalisation and simplification of wage scales which could not have been achieved through the mechanism of the Industrial Disputes Act. The pursuit of unanimity in making recommendations, however, led to ignoring of principles and necessary wage differentials. The most persistent criticism of wage boards has been on the score of long and increasing delay. In spite of the threat of legislation, which has often been repeated, implementation has become increasingly difficult. The basic question which has to be answered now is the comparative roles of collective bargaining and government intervention in industrial relations.||Bagaram Tulpule

26/10/1968- ||special articles||4359225||Violence in America: An Anthropological Perspective||Violence is more highly approved in some societies than in others. American society is not one of those in which violence is toned down. It is the easier solution in drama and popular literature at any rate. Yet Americans are not notably more given to violence than many other people who declare themselves peace-loving. America's status as a super power nevertheless gives world-wide importance to its outbreaks of violence at home and abroad. Revolutions have usually come out of rising hopes rather than out of profound despair. So it is now with a good many young people in American society, who have discovered the many jugular veins of urban civilisation. There have been notable changes in the expression of violence and aggression as the social system has changed. While there is no great disagreement on dealing with the systemic causes of violence, Americans are so accustomed to quick success in large-scale physical enterprises that political leaders may not be prepared for the long-term efforts required to build viable social enterprises. There is too much faith in the efficacy of dollops of dollars and in the benefits of acres of new hardware.||David G. Mandelbaum

17/2/1968- ||special articles||4358266||The Economics of Packaging||The Indian consumer has begun to appreciate the advantages of good packaging and is prepared to pay for them. Yet the packaging industry looks before and after and pines for what is has not. It envies the economies of scale and the inexpensive high quality raw materials which packaging industry in developed countries can obtain. Analysis of the true causes of the differences between the packaging industries in India and in the developed countries, however, gets blurred by excessive preoccupation with the incidence of excise duties and other government levies. But the fact is that even if these duties were removed entirely, the cost of containers would still be much higher than those of the products of the packaging industry in the developed countries. Too much concern with relatively inconsequential factors can obscure the real causes of the relative backwardness of the Indian packaging industry. An attempt is made here to emphasise some of the fundamental factors responsible for the differences in efficiency between the packaging industries in this country and abroad.||Arabinda Ray

The ambitious IUCD programme was, however, launched without either. The authorities evidently based their optimistic expectations almost entirely on the cheapness of the IUCD as a family planning device. They ignored the preconditions for successful mass use of IUCDs. The results are evident in the following study of the impact of the programme in West Bengal which shows that not only has the IUCD programme failed but by its failure it has created a popular climate inimical to family planning in general.

Questions such as these may assist the construction of academic models of African political behaviour and processes, but they do not greatly further understanding of Africa. Far more worthwhile would it be to know what kind of changes have taken place in Africa during the post-war period, to examine the international situation that faces African countries and to understand who were the people who led the independence struggle in Africa and how they came to power. This article appears in two parts for reasons of space. In this, the first part, the author sketches the colonial origins of the present political divisions in Africa, examines the character of the economies of African countries and its consequences for their societies and, against this background, seeks to interpret the character of African revolution. In the second part of the article, which will appear next week, the author will discuss the Indian response to Africa.||Anirudha Gupta
1/1/1968- ||shifting parameters||4358132||Campaign Strategy and Voting Behaviour||In many parts of the country the 1967 elections were marked by a break from the earlier patterns of voting and group and party loyalties. The following study of the Kamlapur constituency in Mysore was undertaken to see how voters in 1967 reacted to various stimuli in the constituency which was reputed to be politically more conscious, where the candidates made distinguishable issues the basis of campaign strategy, and where the Congress was said to be in real danger for the first time. The study and its conclusions are based on the assumption that the research investigator, after closely observing the campaign of the different candidates, can by a process of inference and deduction get at the presumptions on which each candidate had based his election strategy. Then, by analysing the final pattern of voting, he can draw conclusions about how voters in fact reacted to the different stimuli administered by the candidates. The study shows that, while local loyalties and appeal to sentiments still worked, there was a weakening of loyalties to traditional village leaders and of the charisma of names like Nehru and Gandhi. In fact, whenever there was a division in the new composite elite group in the village, there was a division of the village vote.||B. B. Patil

A sector as big and as important as agriculture deserves more detailed analysis. This paper aims to outline a model frame for agricultural planning. The model is pieced together from varied but interrelated segments, some of which are fixed arbitrarily on non-economic and normative considerations whereas others are based on different notions of optimisation. Numerical work on a few segments of this model has been in progress at the Indian Statistical Institute, though it will be quite some time before the entire model is translated into a complete numerical exercise.

Though there is immense scope for stepping up yields from their present pitiful levels, very little has been done over the years towards this end. This year, however, the record oilseeds crop and the increased availability of castor oil and oilcakes should result in a sharp increase in exports.||D. P. Sharma

It takes about two years to revise the 'final' estimates, framed soon after the harvest, on the basis of complete returns of production. This paper analyses errors in the 'final' estimates, as revealed by the 'revised' estimates, in respect of 15 major crops - seven food and eight non-food crops - over the period 1951-52 to 1961-62. While the magnitude of error is, on average seen to be moderate in many of the crops studied, large errors are not uncommon and, more important, the final estimate is found to systematically understate the level of production, particularly of foodgrains. Analysis of movement of errors over time and of the relationship between 'final' estimates and 'revised' estimates suggests that it should be possible to devise procedures for correction of 'final' estimates using information about past errors. Further, correlations among errors in different crops indicate that estimates for some of the crops may have common sources of error and that examination of errors at lower levels of aggregation may yield useful additional information.

10/2/1968- ||special articles||4358239||Hindi as Link Language||Regardless of any initiative on the part of the Central Government, many social forces seem to be working for the spread of Hindi as a link language. The large size of the Hindi-speaking population constitutes an attractive market for a variety of goods and services and is likely to propel people into familiarity with the language in order to take advantage of this market. The already existing situation of Hindi as a lingua franca over a large part of the country, with virtually no competition from any Indian language for such a role, makes it attractive to those who seek employment opportunities outside their own region. Finally, many voluntary agencies are engaged in spreading knowledge of Hindi and they are assisted in their task indirectly by the movies and the radio. Thus, given a stable political system, knowledge of Hindi is likely to spread in non-Hindi areas and aid the emergence of Hindi as a universal lingua franca in the country.||Baldev Raj Nayar

In this sense education is a liberation from bounds and limits and from conventional concepts of value and validity.||Iravati Karve

This raises an important question regarding the character of the growth potential created, viz, whether it has built-in tendencies to counteract the adverse effects of weather or to accentuate them. The analysis in this paper indicates that (i) increase in productivity has become the major component of growth; (ii) this increase in productivity depends largely on inputs other than assured irrigation; and (iii) consequently, productivity increases are more unstable. If production and growth policy is ineffective in reducing the fluctuations in output and if, in fact, it accentuates fluctuations, then, the task of stabilising consumption through procurement, storage and distribution of foodgrains assumes much greater importance.

03/2/1968- ||special articles||4358209||Rural Change in Perspective||In February 1931, the Rohtak district of Punjab was in the grip of drought and famine. The economic and social conditions of the district at that time were carefully and sympathetically recorded by M L Darling in his book "Wisdom and Waste in the Punjab Village". Darling's account provides a base from which rural change since the time he wrote his book can be observed in perspective. A follow-up excursion in Darling's footsteps can throw into relief economic and social change at the village level which might be scarcely perceptible if viewed over a shorter interval. In 1966 the writer of this article visited six of the villages which Darling had studied in 1931. An attempt is made here to compare the current social and economic situation in these villages with that which Darling described in his book.

SSP emerged from the elections as the principal opposition to Congress with 68 seats to the latter's 108. But if SSP had been able to form an electoral alliance with PSP to avoid mutual contests, the two socialist parties could conceivably have won over 100 seats between them. These findings are of interest in the context of the mid-term elections to be held in Bihar in a few months. The outcome of the poll will depend very much on the ability of the non-Congress parties to keep down to the minimum contests among themselves. While Congress party's performance in 1967 was dismal, it was nevertheless clear that it continued to be the only party with a State-wide organisation. This was reflected in the fact that support for Congress did not fluctuate as widely from district to district as did support for SSP.

09/3/1968- ||special articles||4358341||Trade Union Influence in Elections: A Case Study||This paper is about the voting behaviour of a community of mill workers during the 1967 General Elections. The neighbourhood has been a hotbed of political work and union activity during the last three decades. It is considered a stronghold of the communist union. Most of the residents always voted Left in previous elections. However, in the 1967 elections, the majority of votes in the community went against the declared union policy. The paper brings out some of the reasons for the variance between labour's concerns and the union's influence. It also throws light on the interaction between multiple unionism and class consciousness of organised labour in voting behaviour. The data for this paper were collected by non-participant observations in the community under study. The field work started about a month before the elections, became intensive during the polling week, and continued for two weeks after the polling.||A. C. Nanda
06/4/1968- ||special articles||4358460||The Food Problem in India: Trade Not the Crux of It||The belief is widely shared that the food shortage is created by the trader-stockist who withholds foodgrains from the market to realise high prices from the consumer after having purchased from the producer at comparatively low prices, thus exploiting both consumer and producer. This article argues that though the trader might accentuate a shortage where it already exists, he cannot create the problem. Only 20 per cent of the entire production is held and shifted to urban areas by traders. The gross income from this, after deducting transport and storage costs from the final price paid to the trader, when divided by the working force engaged in the trade yields a low average. It is argued here that a few rich traders apart, the rest cannot have the holding capacity attributed to them. Any policy which concentrates on distribution of foodgrains is tenable only from the short-term point of view. But where total availability is short of total minimum requirements, distributive justice is not the essence of the problem which has to be solved from the end of raising production and availability.||K.

But little use has been made of them in this country mainly for want of reliable data about our forest wealth. Forest statistics are hopelessly inadequate and their collection too sporadic and irregular to be of much help in decision-making. Decisions about the type of trees to be developed, the rotational and situational practices to be followed, etc, demand extreme caution since hardwood plants take about 50 years to mature. In fact, these decisions are very often taken on the basis of the whims of a particular Conservator of Forests. The results of lack of statistical data and a scientific attitude to forest management are aggravated by the existing administrative structure which concentrates all authority in the Conservators of Forests leaving little room for specialist advice and direction.||P.

There are authors who have argued that cultivators do respond to price changes and found empirical evidence to support their argument. There are also those who hold that the price elasticity of supply of agricultural commodities is zero or negative. In India not many studies have focused on this question.

The subject assumes special importance in a country like India where economic insecurity looms large both before and after the soldiers' stay in the army. At the same time the Government cannot afford to maintain an adequate reserve of fully-paid officers in peacetime to meet sudden military exigencies. Release and resettlement of soldiers thus pose serious problems which require careful planning. This article is based on a survey of a small group of discharged army officers. Their answers to questions pertaining to their reasons for joining the army and their attitude to their discharge from the army and problems of post-release adjustment reveal that the dominant motive for joining the army was economic rather than political or ideological. Following their release, all the respondents suffer from a deep sense of frustration both because they felt they had a right to continue in their army jobs after the grave risks they took in the Indo-Pakistan war and because of fear that they may not get suitable civilian jobs.

Assam's experience demonstrates how unrealistic procurement prices can start a vicious circle leading to collapse of any scheme of public distribution of foodgrains. Thus, procurement prices in the State were fixed too low, lower in fact than the average cost of production. This led to large farmers selling their produce to private agencies. The consequent failure of procurement resulted in the fair price shops in the State being starved of rice and consumers being thrown on the 'free' market for most of their requirements, leading to soaring prices of rice. This made it possible for private agencies to offer even more attractive prices to the grower. Ultimately the consumer - in whose interest procurement prices had been fixed low - ended up by paying in the 'free' market far higher prices than he would have had to pay had the procurement price been originally fixed at a level which would have induced the large farmers to sell their surplus to the government.||P.

The targeted rate of growth of real national income should, therefore, be such as is consistent with the feasible rate of growth of agricultural output. The feasible rate of growth of agricultural output in the Fourth Plan, it is estimated here, is around 3 to 3.5 per cent per annum. This, taken together with a population growth of 2.5 per cent per annum and an expenditure elasticity of demand for foodgrains of 0.8, gives a feasible rate of growth of real national income of 4.5 to 5 per cent per annum. But even if agricultural output rises at the expected rate over the Plan period, there is the problem of fluctuations in output. This problem cannot be tackled without the Government directly controlling output-disposal in the good years. Skilful operation of a buffer stock policy is essential for achieving price stability and steady growth. In the absence of a buffer stock policy, attempts to use monetary and fiscal instruments to counter fluctuations in agricultural production will only aggravate fluctuations in investment and industrial output.||V.

27/7/1968- ||special articles||4358867||The Indian Labour Market||Most of the common hypotheses about the Indian labour market are outdated and invalid. Differences between the Indian labour market and labour markets in developed countries are not of essence but only of degree. The Indian labour market is believed to be exceptionally imperfect. Actually labour markets everywhere are more or less imperfect because of the peculiarities of labour; that the degree of imperfection should be rather more in a large underdeveloped country with pronounced socio-cultural differences between different regions is to be expected. On the other hand, the historical tendency for geographical wage-differentials to narrow and the evidence of gradual breaking of the barriers to geographical mobility suggest evolution of a national labour market. Similarly, the view that industrial labour, being mainly migrant, is not stable and does not have a high degree of commitment is not based on any evidence. The extent of instability has been very much exaggerated; further, instability is at least partly the result of employers' policies of constantly changing the workforce so as to keep down wage bills. Recent studies show that industrial workers are getting committed to the industrial way of living. The number of those who entertain ideas of returning to farms is progressively diminishing and, in spite of miserable housing conditions in industrial cities, an increasing percentage of workers now live with their wives and families.||T.

He had suggested that since it has been claimed that the aggregated Farm Management data reveal an inverse relationship between size and yield, it should be examined whether there was something in the aggregation process that had given rise to a spurious statistical relationship. On studying the disaggregated data of the Farm Management Survey and comparing them with the aggregated tables published in the Survey reports, the author finds that there is no need to look beyond or below the Farm Management data. These data, he demonstrates in this article, do not permit of the generalised conclusions that have been drawn. The inferences about the relationship between size and yield, he concludes, have been drawn without adequate examination of the data.

In the absence of an agricultural income-tax, mobilisation of resources from the villages can take place only through excise duties on consumer products like textiles and soaps sold in the rural areas. Personal assessment and understanding of the rural community and its needs and desires is a prime essential in the designing of products and in the organisation of a distribution and advertising mechanism. It would be rash to expect that a new product will swiftly penetrate the rural areas on its own steam. Manufacturers who take a long view of selective distribution and attractive point of sale advertising can be assured that in due course their expense and enterprise will earn them a level of brand loyalty unsurpassed in any urban area.||M.

Although excessive political involvement may hamper the growth of co-operatives as economic institutions, within certain limits such involvement may not be dysfunctional. Besides, co-operatives perform certain latent political functions which are significant from the point of view of the political development of a democratic society. The analysis attempted here of the nature of political involvement of co-operatives and its implications for both the co-operatives and the wider political system is largely based on the author's empirical observations drawn from rural Maharashtra.

Inevitably, therefore, the Governor becomes a party-man as his tenure of office can be terminated by the authority that appoints him. It would be absurd to argue that a person whose continuance in office depends on the goodwill of the Central Government will act in any way other than according to its instructions. That is why it is necessary to approach with caution any interpretation of the Constitution which involves an extension of the powers of the Governor. The greater the discretion vested in the Governor the greater the possibility of Central intervention in State affairs. In their own area of power, the States must be as supreme as the Centre is in its. To give discretionary powers to the Governor will be to open the door to Central intervention in a manner which was not anticipated by the framers of the Constitution and which goes directly against the principle of State autonomy.||S.

At operational levels, the distinction between Jan Sangh and SSP gets very blurred. The style of politics of SSP leaders, their fanaticism, their misplaced enthusiasm for non-economic causes, their intolerance of differences of opinion, the party's dismal record of work in Bihar, UP and elsewhere and its inability to live up to its declared radical objectives lead one to question whether SSP is really a progressive party. The danger is that part of the rank and file of the SSP may consider it advantageous to defect to Jan Sangh which, in an attempt to gain broader national acceptability, adopted resolutions at its Calicut session committing the party to an egalitarian society. This may open the way for socialists in search of political support and disciplined cadres to draw closer to the Jan Sangh. Such realignment of political forces is bound to prove to be favourable to non-socialist, anti-secular forces.

Emergence of an indigenous nuclear deterrence against China will increase the military options available for meeting a Chinese threat within the overall framework of the big power military equation. We can be confident that in the immediate future both the super powers will be willing to help us in strengthening our defences against China. But this community of interest between us and the super powers may not last for ever. In their global search for regional military stability the super powers may, in concert or independently, work out an understanding with China. China may also not remain eternally averse to an understanding with the super powers, especially if it is promised a wide enough sphere of influence in South and South-East Asia. Our search for a policy which will ensure national security must, in the long run, address itself to two interrelated tasks: (1) Augmenting our defence strength and deterrent power; and, (2) Opening up channels of communication with China and Pakistan with a view to arriving at an acceptable accommodation with them.||B.

At present, the cost of living indices are used to determine the scale of dearness allowance, the rates of compensation being fixed more or less arbitrarily. Despite their many recognised weaknesses, these indices remain the only tool for measuring the loss of real income. A method is suggested in the following article which makes use of variable and constant elasticities for classifying items into essential and non-essential categories, and thus provides for a better and more acceptable basis for calculating the full compensation for additional expenditure on essential goods.||Mohanlal Ganguli,Salil Kumar Sanyal

Planners can therefore no longer assume a constant capital-output ratio nor can the cost-push pressure on prices be resisted.

It is important, therefore, that entrepreneurs appreciate the considerations that influence a financial institution's decision to finance a project. This enables the industrialist to present his proposal effectively and to concentrate on the essential points in his dialogue with the institution. In examining a proposal, the financial institution, like the entrepreneur, is concerned primarily with the viability of the project. There is actually only a limited area of genuine conflict of interest between the industrialist and the institution. The objectives of both are the same: to participate in the setting up of a profitable project. But being an external body, a finance institution brings an independent approach to assessing the prospects of the project. It closely examines market prospects, location and capacity, availability of ancillary facilities and raw materials, project costs and fixed and working capital requirements, methods of financing and profitability and cash flow.||Phiroze B.

The first section tries to establish the proposition that various policy recommendations regarding the method of production to be chosen may depend more on some 'structural features' of the economy rather than policy objectives relating to shorter and longer-run points of view. The argument developed here differs from the widely accepted one which attempts to explain differences in recommendations regarding the choice of technique primarily in terms of differences in objectives. For a demonstration of this proposition, use is made of the Marxian two-departmental scheme. Section II briefly sketches the relevance of this kind of macro-economic theorising by discussing some of the underlying assumptions in relation to the type of economic organisations which will broadly justify such assumptions.||Amit Bhaduri

10/8/1968- ||special articles||4358916||Towns: Size, Economic Structure and Growth||Studies on urban growth in India have generally suggested a positive relationship between size of towns and their growth. This article questions this hypothesis and attempts to indicate an alternative approach to explaining differences in the rates of growth of towns. The positive relationship sought to be established between size and growth of towns is based on use of the instantaneous method of measuring urban growth. This method, it is argued here, has severe limitations when used for comparing growth of different size-groups of towns between two censuses. If, instead, the continuous method of measuring urban growth is used, the results for 1951-61 do not support the hypothesis of a positive relationship between size and growth of towns during the decade. For the earlier two decades also the relationship, though positive, is weak and is at least in part seen to be the outcome of certain peculiar conditions that prevailed during the period. Growth of towns is related not so much to the size of towns as to their economic character. Examination of census data shows that towns and cities characterised by modern industry have grown faster than the rest.||K. B. Suri

The years studied are 1960-61 and 1965-66. The tax burden is examined also in relation to the per capita income in the States which are classified as agricultural or less agricultural on the basis of their income composition. It is concluded that, total State taxation was low in Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, and Uttar Pradesh, both from the point of view of the per capita burden and the proportion of tax to income. Further that, in Punjab and Orissa, the land revenue burden, and in West Bengal, the sales tax burden, could be substantially increased.||S. Chandrasekhar

1/1/1968- ||planning strategy||4358114||The Strategy of Foreign Trade Planning||Theoretical studies and empirical evidence both point to the critical importance of foreign trade in the drafting of a strategy for accelerated development. One of the most important and delicate phases of perspective planning lies in the detailed evaluation of "foreign currency efficiency" of export-oriented and import-substituting investments. Export promotion or import substitution matter only in the sense of exchange value, not use value, i e, it is immaterial what particular goods are produced because the foreign currency earned or saved may be used to purchase any required good. On the other hand, the efficiency of investment in domestic goods requires choosing of the best project for the production of a given use value. Planning of foreign trade involves two distinct but inter-connected operations: the allocation of export-promoting and import-substituting investments, and the allocation of the capacity to import. This is far from the traditional approach which uses elasticities or similar parameters. How far one can move on the list of 'efficient' exports depends on the volume of imports that must be paid for and the incremental capital-output ratio in the export-promoting industries. For practical purposes, it is possible to fix for every plan a minimum level of efficiency of exports, not to be exceeded unless an adverse shift of terms of trade occurs.||Ignacy Sachs

27/7/1968- ||special articles||4358869||Income Shifts as a Factor in the Recession||There has been a marked shift in distribution of income in favour of the agricultural sector after 1962-63. Since agriculture is taxed relatively less than industry, this has adversely affected Government revenues. In other words, the change in distribution of income has had the effect of reducing, relatively speaking, purchasing power in the hands of government and the non-agricultural sector. As a result, there has appeared a deflationary gap in the economy which deficit financing has failed to make good. On the contrary, deficit financing has tended to accentuate the change in relative prices, and therefore in distribution of income, in favour of agriculture. Unless the shift in distribution of income in favour of agriculture is reversed, the deflationary tendency in the economy will persist. To overcome this tendency it is necessary to bring about a fall in agricultural prices so as to alter the terms of trade in favour of the rest of the economy. Over the next five years, it is therefore suggested here, government's price policy should have as its objective a 2 per cent per annum decline in agricultural prices.||Phiroze B. Medhora

The basic need of any extension education programme is a clear understanding of why crop yields are low and why they vary from one field to another. Undertaking extension work in a big way before the institution of strong and effective research facilities can have only one result - that of making the fountain of extension service run dry very quickly. Each State and each region has to develop new forms of inputs appropriate to its particular circumstances. This demands that field-oriented research be integrated with extension education services so that research agencies are made aware of the problems of agriculturists as soon as they arise and farmers derive the benefits of the latest knowledge as soon as it emerges.||K.

There is much to be said, in theory, for a system under which each bank sets its own deposit and advances rates. The resulting competition among banks would, it might be argued, ensure that the resources of the community are deployed to the best advantage. It is questionable, however, whether in practice banks will really put up with a regime of free competition which will inevitably cut into their profit margins. More likely, they will come to informal or formal understandings among themselves on their lending and borrowing rates. The choice thus is not between competition and official regulation but between private cartel arrangements among banks and some degree of official regulation to counter such arrangements.||Philip Thomas

The validity of this assumption is doubtful. Equity participation by foreign collaborators has played only a minor role in providing foreign exchange for import of capital goods by joint ventures. The predominant part of the foreign exchange required for such imports has come through loans from various official agencies. Besides, about one-half of the non-resident subscription has come in kind, not in cash. These findings pinpoint the need for Government to review its policy towards financial collaborations.||K. K.

24/2/1968- ||special articles||4358293||Planning Educational Programmes: Implications of Population Trends||Urbanisation will help to raise literacy and school enrolment, while industrialisation will help in reducing rural-urban differentials in literacy rates. On the other hand, expansion of compulsory education will cause a rise in age at marriage, especially of girls. A combination of these three factors is likely to reduce fertility which, in turn, will help to make provision for school facilities a little easier. The differences in the years of school life remaining at various ages in the total population and in the enrolled population will be reduced considerably with the growth in enrolment. India will then be at the same level in terms of expectation of school life at which the advanced countries today are. It is quite likely that a higher proportion of persons in the adult population will become literate on their own as compared to those made literate through the adult literacy programmes, as was experienced in the fifties, and this will help considerably in liquidating illiteracy in the next twenty years or so. Only one-sided relationships - that is, involving the effect of population growth on educational facilities and growth of education - have been examined in this study. It is likely that when the process is reversed - that is, dependent variables are treated as independent and independent variables as dependent - more important relationships between population growth and educational development would be revealed.||Mahendra Kumar Premi

So long as labour productivity in agriculture remains low or stagnant, there can be no scope for raising real wages in the industrial sector irrespective of trends in labour productivity in industry. Certain implications for economic policy, of which wage policy is a part, follow from this. Wage determination in any particular industry cannot be regarded as something that concerns only the industry; its impact will be felt on overall economic development and so it is a matter for Government concern. Further, wage policy, if it is to mean anything, has to be part of a comprehensive incomes policy in which growth of wages and profits is tailored to the requirements of the desired rate of economic development. These considerations are of relevance to the work of the National Labour Commission which has necessarily to view the question of wages in the larger context of economic growth and income distribution.||D.

This study of attitudes to untouchability, based on data collected from seven Rajasthan villages, indicates that secular prestige affecting behaviour is more change-prone than ritually polluting behaviour. There is much greater resistance to inter-marrying with the untouchables or permitting them to enter temples than there is to making available to them opportunities for education or extending to them special economic concessions. Thus in tackling untouchability instead of a frontal attack on the jealously guarded ritual aspects of the problem an indirect attack on an apparently distant but secular aspect like education will be more productive.

China began with the preferred Soviet model but found it necessary to deviate because the base from which it started represented much smaller resources and much larger population; besides, the spatial distribution of resources and population also differed widely. It was feasible for Soviet Union to neglect agriculture and go in for large modern industrial plants, but not so for China. The Chinese strategy can be explained in terms of its requirements and resource endowments and should not be attributed mainly to the withdrawal of Soviet aid.

The changes spring from a number of sources such as urbanisation, industrialisation, contact with non-tribals outside the tribal areas, missionary activities and the work of social welfare agencies. Under the impact of this multiple culture-contact and change, the tribals are losing the characteristics of primitive tribal societies and acquiring those of a peasant society. These changes get reflected in the pattern of tribal leadership in the State. There has been over the past several years a definite shift in the character of leadership from the religious to the secular. This article tries to trace the change in the character of tribal leadership, its politicisation, and the actual and potential consequences of this for the tribes.||Sashishekhar Jha

25/5/1968- ||review of management, may 1968||4358662||Business in Society||Business has not been honoured by tradition in Indian society. Social values through the ages have tended to give importance to virtues which are opposed to the qualities that lead to success in business. Awakening society to the importance of economic operations for the nation's progress so that the more dynamic elements of society are encouraged to look upon business and industry as worthwhile objects of professional pursuit should, therefore, be a major objective of educational policy. Today it is not. The growth of management studies and the establishment of post-graduate institutes of quality do credit to business and Government for appreciating that a body of knowledge has now been built up in the field of management which has to be diligently studied. But these institutions remain adjuncts to the educational system, while the mainstream of the system, devoted still to producing clerks and lawyers, is treated as a sacred flow which must remain true to age-old tradition.||Arabinda Ray
19/10/1968- ||special articles||4359201||Consumption and Savings: Implications for Fourth Plan||The failure of domestic savings to rise to planned levels has been the major cause of the instability that has plagued the economy and disrupted planning in the last three years. Available data indicate that a high rate of domestic saving may not be easily or quickly attainable in the Fourth Plan as well. Rural savings are unlikely to record an appreciable increase for some years unless a big and sustained increase is achieved in agricultural production. And with urban savings continuing to finance investment in agriculture, resources available for investment in the secondary and tertiary sectors will be inadequate to absorb the rapidly growing employable population in the urban areas. The possibility of decline in net inflow of external resources will further reduce the rate of investment that can be supported in the economy consistent with price stability. The primary concern of the Fourth Plan, therefore, should be, first, to evaluate the attainable rate of saving in the economy; second, to locate the sectors from which additional savings can be drawn; and, finally, to formulate policies for resource mobilisation.||Arun Ghosh

If the crops which are compared with cane in assessing the comparative advantage among States are not irrigated to the same extent as in a given State, inter-State comparison is vitiated by the irrigation factor. Moreover, with the recent introduction of high-yielding varieties of foodgrains, the relative advantage of cane vis-a-vis these crops within each State is in flux. One firm conclusion that can be drawn is that UP does not appear to have suffered till recently from any comparative disadvantage in growing cane.||B. D. Dhawan

26/10/1968- ||review of agriculture, october 1968||4359232||New Agricultural Strategy Revisited||The New Agricultural Strategy is based on concentration of high-yielding varieties of seeds and complementary inputs on selected water-assured areas. The decision to concentrate resources marked a major departure from earlier agricultural policies. This strategy has been questioned by B S Minhas and T N Srinivasan. Using data from the 1964-65 all-India co-ordinated wheat yield trial they demonstrated in 1966 that fertilisers should not be concentrated on high-yielding varieties but should be spread to both the local and the new varieties. Marginal responses of the high-yielding varieties at economically optimal dosages of fertilisers were, they showed, below the marginal responses of local varieties at initial dosages. Minhas and Srinivasan based their policy conclusions on the data then available; these conclusions need to be re-examined now in the light of new data. This paper presents the results of the 1966-67 co-ordinated agronomy trials testing high-yielding varieties of wheats at several locations all over the country. The conclusions that emerge are: (a) the high dosages of chemical nutrients recommended for the new varieties of wheat are justified; and, (b) the allocation of fertilisers among new and old varieties indicated in the official strategy is optimal for maximum output.

This is a meaningless exercise because the latter have primarily commercial or profit objectives, while the former have been set up for a variety of considerations, of which the commercial objective is only one. To avoid fuzziness about performance appraisal, it is essential that the non-commercial objectives of a public enterprise should be identified and quantified before it is set up. The author suggests that the profit and loss account of public undertakings should be split in two parts, commercial and non-commercial, and each part should be appraised on the basis of predetermined standards. Annual budgets and standard costs should be framed for all such undertakings and the weights assigned to various objectives should be clearly established.||S. K. Bhattacharyya

Have sales and purchases of agricultural lands been actually conforming to this desired pattern so that over a period of time the cultivating class may be expected to emerge as a homogeneous group, as it must if agricultural co-operatives are to be viable? All the information necessary for answering this question is not available, but data on purchases and sales of farm land have been collected by the Rural Credit Follow-up Surveys and the 1961-62 All-India Rural Debt and Investment Survey conducted by the Reserve Bank. These data are examined here.||H. B. Shivamaggi

01/6/1968- ||special articles||4358695||Irrigation Rates in Orissa: How Commercial Should They Be?||There is a tendency on the part of the States to manage irrigation works on commercial lines. The objective generally being to make the irrigation works pay at least for their working expenses and debt charges. An increase in water rates is often suggested as a method of improving the financial position of the irrigation works. Although there is some weight in the argument, it suffers from certain limitations. It prescribes rates only on the basis of working expenses and debt charges, and puts too much emphasis on costs to the neglect of the degree of benefit conferred by the irrigation system. States with older irrigation systems constructed at lower cost and with well-developed agriculture would be more suitable for the application of the principle than States with new irrigation works with their higher costs. In Orissa, for instance, most of the irrigation works are of recent origin. They are not supported by a well-developed agriculture in the State. In the circumstances, if water rates are fixed high enough to cover the cost of water supply, cultivators would be discouraged from utilising the irrigation facilities. With its predominant agricultural sector, which is frequently affected by large-scale drought, the extension of irrigation facilities in the State is a basic requirement of agricultural development. Even if irrigation projects do not yield sufficient revenue to cover their working expenses and debt charges, therefore, their development as a social overhead is an imperative.||Srish Chandra Patnaik
13/4/1968- ||special articles||4358491||Application of the Linear Expenditure System to NSS Data: Some Further Results||This paper compares, from the point of view of quality of predictions, two alternative demand functions, namely, (i) the most commonly used constant elasticity function and (ii) the Linear Expenditure System (LES). The LES was first introduced by Stone [1] and applied to Indian data by the present writer [2]. Some results were also published in Rudra's "Relative Rates of Growth: Agriculture and Industry" [3]. The conclusion that emerges is as follows: Projections on the basis of the constant elasticity model naturally vary depending on the period chosen as base and on the period to which the cross-section elasticity refers. Projections on the basis of the constant elasticity model are, on the whole, much poorer than those based on the Linear Expenditure System except when the period for which projection is made is very near to the base period. This is not surprising. The constant elasticity model is totally incapable of taking account of shifts in the demand curve resulting from changes in the relative price structure of goods and services over time. The LES, which takes prices as explanatory variables, does not suffer from this limitation. If in the very short run prices do not vary much, then the quality of the projections would not, of course, differ a great deal.

The seven industries covered are cotton textiles, jute textiles, iron and steel, cement, paper and paper boards, chemicals and chemical products and sugar. The broad conclusions which emerge from this exploratory exercise are: (1) Rise in real wages, overall and industrywise, lagged behind improvement in labour productivity. (2) Though the overall trend in money wages was similar to that in real wages, rise in money wages outpaced that in productivity in cotton textiles, sugar and iron and steel. (3) The relatively greater rise in labour productivity may be partly associated with the increase in fixed capital per unit of labour and improvement in management techniques. (4) The wage component of total industrial costs was relatively small (less than one-fifth of total costs) and the wage-cost ratio declined during the period, except in cotton and jute textiles. (5) The falling trend in the wage-cost ratio holds good even if the overall share of labour cost (i e, salaries and wages) is taken as a percentage of total cost of industrial output.||H. B.

14/9/1968- ||special articles||4359053||Pricing Gujarat Natural Gas: An Alternative Approach||The recent award on pricing of natural gas in Gujarat by V K R V Rao provides an interesting case in public sector pricing. Rao states that his award is based on the "cost plus profit" formula. In his estimation of costs and profits, however, Rao has virtually ignored the relevance of crude in ONGC's operations - his implicit assumption being that, in a multiproduct firm, prices should be set by estimating the cost of individual products and adding on a uniform rate of return on the investment in each product. However, the problem of allocating joint costs in a multiproduct firm has yet to be solved even theoretically. Moreover, the "rate to return" is meaningful more from the point of view of the enterprise as a whole rather than of each product, so that a product capable of contributing more to profit would be earning higher than the average rate of return to the enterprise, offsetting the lower returns earned by the firm's less profitable products. The argument that oil operations have little relevance in the gas price dispute is, therefore, valid only upto a point. This article examines V K R V Rao's approach to pricing of gas and suggests an alternative approach.||Samuel Paul

In fact, there are some unrecognised similarities between the social philosophies of Gandhi and Marx. Both recognised social conflict as a fact. But in addition to conflict between capitalist and labourer, and landlord and cultivator, Gandhi recognised the conflict between village and city where the terms of trade offered for food and raw materials by the latter were exploitative. Like Marx, Gandhi also recognised the need to invoke the stronger - not merely the higher - forces in human nature for terminating exploitation. But while Marx talked of violent proletariat action in the cities, Gandhi put forth the ideas of non-co-operation and passive resistance by the exploited against the exploiters, and he believed that this would cultivate the idea of "trusteeship" among the owners of land and capital. Also, while - unlike Marx who would allow only the State to be owner of property - Gandhi allowed for individual ownership insofar as the owner himself directly used the property or worked on it, he also wanted any major means of producing the implements for individual use to be State-owned.||A.

They also shape decision-making in some spheres at the national and State levels. The political elite of the caste play a crucial role in promoting the interests of the association. In turn they benefit from the support of the caste association, since such support can be used to put pressures to get certain decisions through even when the politicians themselves do not have the authority to take the decisions. This is a study of the of the Mahasabha of the Yadava caste, an association founded in 1924, which has become progressively politicised.

Little attention has so far been paid to the development of these towns. This article attempts to indicate the predominant characteristics of the economies of these towns in terms of the pattern of distribution of the work force among the different sectors. For the economic development of the State it is necessary to single out a few of these towns and follow a deliberate policy of encouraging location of modern industries in them.||M. P.

On the basis of a case study of workers in an automobile plant in Bombay, the author finds that this hypothesis, accepted for long by anthropologists among others, is not correct. The worker's 'favourableness' to the firm in which he is employed is related neither to the rural-urban background nor to his occupational status. Seniority and certain age-related variables are more significant in this connection.||Baldev R. Sharma

27/7/1968- ||special articles||4358866||Czechoslovakia and Communism||At this stage it is difficult to attempt even a short-term prophecy on the likely outcome of the new model of socialism in Czechoslovakia. Abstractly speaking, it is the kind of model towards which advanced socialist countries would seem to have to evolve. But a society never operates in a "pure" situation; social experiments are conducted through the dialectic of life. The contingent and the accidental, therefore, play a far greater role in social evolution than long-term analysts would like to concede. For the Czech experiment a great deal would depend on the attitude of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union which, while not impervious to change, has a built-in predilection towards caution emanating from the far greater responsibility it bears as well as from a four-decade old tradition, the totality of which is not wholly positive. This important contingent factor will naturally influence the actions of both the anti-socialist and the conservative-communist forces in Czechoslovakia. This, in turn, could set off a chain reaction leading to the very tragedy which Soviet caution would seem to want to avoid.||Mohit Sen

By making English a truly associate language in education, we could accelerate the enrichment of our languages. Instead we have thought it better to stuff our languages with bizarre synthetic coinages. We created terminology commissions and thought that as soon as we supplied sufficient readymade technical terms, our languages would be enriched. This obsession with terminology has blocked all channels of normal growth of expression in our languages. There are greater possibilities of new expressions coming into a language under conditions of active bilingualism. Our goal in the education system should be to ensure that a discourse in the Indian languages begins. Such a discourse will gain momentum only by interaction with English. The educational system must be so designed that we use our own languages and also English. A versatile interaction between the two through functional bilingualism will accelerate the infusion of new expressions into our languages without burdening them with new coinage.||P. B. Pandit

03/8/1968- ||special articles||4358889||Women in the Working Force in India||The great majority of women workers in India are engaged either in agriculture and traditional rural industries or in service occupations. The work participation rate of urban women is significantly lower than that of rural women and that of literate women lower than that of illiterate women. The secular trend is for the participation rate for women to fall. Unless countervailing influences come into play, economic development with its accompanying urbanisation, spread of education and growth of modern industries will be accompanied by a progressive decline in the participation rate for women. Participation of women in large numbers in strategic sectors like education, health, rural extension and social welfare can be a major factor in accelerating changes in attitudes and behaviour patterns which will contribute to modernisation and increase in output. It is, therefore, necessary to investigate the reasons for decline in work participation rate of women and for their negligible participation in modern activities.||Kamla Nath

The Reserve Bank, however, did not adopt such a policy for fear of adversely affecting the bond market and raising the servicing costs of public debt. Actually, public debt management, aiming at rational allocation of real resources, itself demanded appropriate upward revision of the rates of interest in order to increase the competitiveness of Government securities. So there was no conflict between public debt management and an anti-inflationary monetary policy, as mistakenly assumed by the monetary authorities.

21/12/1968- ||special articles||4359470||Indo-Ceylon Ties after Senanayake's Visit||In their recent talks in New Delhi, both the Indian and Ceylonese Prime Ministers made concessions which are likely to lay them open to severe criticism in their respective countries. Dudley Senanayake agreed to exempt Ceylonese of Indian origin who have opted for Indian citizenship and who want to transfer their assets to India from having to purchase foreign exchange at a premium under Ceylon's Foreign Exchange Entitlement certificate scheme. Opposition parties in Ceylon, led by the Sree Lanka Freedom Party of Sirimavo Bandaranaike, are bound to interpret this as another instance of the Senanayake Government's surrender to the Tamils. India, for its part, agreed not to press its claims to the Kachchativu island at the talks. As a result, in the joint communique Kachchativu has received only passing mention as one of the many issues involved in joint exploitation of the Palk Straits and Gulf of Mannar areas, in which both countries have evinced keen interest. The opposition parties in India are likely to see this as indifference on Government's part to an issue of vital national interest. With such politically sensitive issues still outstanding, prospects of friendly relations and closer economic collaboration between India and Ceylon depend to a great extent on the ability of the leaderships in the two countries to resist chauvinistic pressures.||Urmila Phadnis

Important among these is the need to prepare the ground in advance for the introduction of a compulsory levy, particularly when there is likely to be resistance to parting with grain at controlled prices. Again, if private enterprise is to be actively associated with procurement, the unit of operation of private agencies should be viable. Adequate finances should be placed with them ahead of purchase operations to meet the rush of post-harvest deliveries by farmers. Insistence on quality control in grain purchased from cultivators has to be tempered by concessions with an eye to rapid progress of the procurement programme. The agency authorised to apply coercive measures under law to enforce the levy should be the same as that which has responsibility for procurement. A dichotomy between the requisitioning agency and the purchasing agency results in avoidable friction. The high order of co-ordination which is necessary for the two to work smoothly is unlikely to be forthcoming, especially at the village and taluk level. Most important of all, frequent changes in policy and grant of a number of exemptions create an atmosphere of uncertainty about the continuation of the procurement levy which cannot but paralyse its implementation. Concessions to mitigate the genuine hardships of cultivators should precede the introduction of the levy scheme, not succeed it.||K. V. Natarajan

28/9/1968- ||special articles||4359110||Changing Balance in Rajasthan Politics: Voting Pattern in 1967||Though it failed to win an absolute majority in the State Assembly, Congress did much better in Rajasthan in the Fourth General Elections than pollsters had predicted. Pessimism on the eve of the elections about the party's chances had stemmed mainly from the breaking away of the influential Jat leader, Kumbh Ram Arya, and the fear of alienation of a substantial section of Jat voters as a result. If these dismal prognostications were not fulfilled it was mainly because the right-wing alliance of Swatantra party, Jan Sangh and dissident Congressmen did not have time to consolidate itself. While in the aggregate Congress did as well in the fourth general elections as it did in the third, the geographical distribution of support for the party was markedly different in 1967. The 1967 elections saw a sharp fall in support for the party in Kotah and Jodhpur which was compensated for by new-found strongholds in Udaipur and Bikaner. These swings were to a large extent linked to the shifting political alliances of Rajasthan's former princely families. Reliance on the support of former rulers remains a major weakness of the Congress in Rajasthan. The party's success in Udaipur, for instance, was largely due to the support of the Maharana of Udaipur. In view of its commitment to a socialistic programme, to which has now been added a commitment to do away with the privy purses of former rulers, reliance on former princes can hardly be a long-term strategy for the Congress. It is in this context that the wisdom of Sukhadia carrying his feud with Kumbh Ram Arya to the point of forcing the latter to leave the party is questionable.

A proper spectrum of credit disbursement, trained personnel and scope for management development and a system attuned to achieving these objectives should now engage our attention. The author, himself a leading banker, argues that the growth of deposits will depend upon the confidence that the banker is able to create among the depositors and the conveniences that he is willing to provide. Geographical expansion and covering of all classes of people for both deposit mobilisation and extension of credit have been difficult because the banks, both public and private, have not cared to develop the flexibility to meet the situation. Instead, the Inter-Bank Agreement seeks to curb initiative in formulating new schemes or new approaches, and to present the customer with a monolithic front. A continuous flow of small deposits, whether in urban or rural areas, can be secured only when the customer develops the habit of going to the bank not merely for depositing his money but also for meeting his essential and productive needs.||T.

(June 22, 1968), S Naqvi, S B Pillai and R P Saha make out a case for continuing the NSS crop survey. The NSS crop survey covers only seven major cereals but it takes up 35 to 40 per cent of the field resources in the socio-economic survey rounds. As a result, the NSS organisation which was created mainly with the intention of collecting data to fill gaps in national income statistics has not fulfilled its purpose. Thus, for instance, NSS had not so far made any serious effort to collect statistics from small industrial establishments or establishments of distributive trade, although these statistics are vital for national income computation. There is also some doubt about the efficiency, practicability and scientific correctness of the methods and designs of crop surveys developed by ISI and adopted by NSS. The ISI Review Committee has drawn attention to the fact that after its involvement with NSS, ISI has neglected its earlier excellent work in sampling and in the theory and application of the technique of large-scale sample surveys. It would be no great loss, therefore, if the NSS crop survey were discontinued. This need not, however, mean that the present supervisory role of NSS in the official State series data (which is distinct from the crop survey conducted in the socio-economic rounds) should come to an end. The autonomous NSS, as reorganised on the lines suggested by the ISI Review Committee, should continue to supervise collection of the official State series data and to compute advance estimates of outturn of crops on the basis of its supervisory sample. Through such "rationalised" supervision, it will be possible to get advance estimates of major cereals and other important crops at all-India and State levels and build up a better system of forecasting.||Counter Statistician

26/10/1968- ||review of agriculture october 1968||4359227||Predatory Capitalism in Indian Agriculture||"Welfare Capitalism" is the principal positive recommendation for agriculture offered by Gunnar Myrdal in his important treatise, "Asian Drama". Yet his own analysis of the agrarian scene in contemporary India suggests that the type of capitalist farming most likely to spread is predatory rather than welfare-oriented. It follows logically that Indian agricultural workers can promote their own welfare best by organising themselves into powerful labour federations. A central weakness of Myrdal's pessimistic treatment is his failure to see that the industrial revolution which has been taking place in India over the two decades since Independence is inevitably dragging agriculture along with it. Whatever the temporary problems with which they may be confronted, India's agriculture and India's industry are much stronger than Myrdal would have us believe. In effect, Myrdal, like the majority of other observers, Indian as well as foreign, is selling India short.||Daniel Thorner

Even for short-term loans for seasonable agricultural operations, in many States co-operative credit societies insist on security of land. And now that commercial banks have also entered the field of agricultural finance, it is important to know which categories of cultivators possess the right to transfer their lands in favour of lending institutions and which do not. This survey of transferability rights in land of various categories of cultivators in the different States leads to the conclusion that even after land reform there still remains a very sizeable group of cultivators all over the country who are in no position to take advantage of medium- and long-term credit facilities because they do have mortgageability rights in their lands.||H.

09/3/1968- ||special articles||4358344||Competitiveness of India's Tea Exports: A Comment||I S Gulati argues ('Competitiveness of India's Tea Exports', February 17, 1968) that following the devaluation of sterling and of the Ceylon rupee the margin of profit enjoyed by Indian exporters of tea is likely to be cut and that, therefore, there should be a corresponding reduction in export duty on tea. This argument is tenable only on the assumptions that Ceylon will take advantage of the devaluation of its currency to reduce the price of its tea and that Indian exporters will not be able to match the lower price of Ceylonese tea. Neither assumption appears to be valid. Ceylon is unlikely to reduce the price of her tea. On the contrary, Ceylon has been very concerned recently about the decline in the export price of its tea and will try to do all it can to stem the trend. In the circumstances, any attempt by India to cut tea prices can only lead to a vicious circle of price-cutting which will benefit neither India nor Ceylon. Even if it is conceded that to remain competitive the price of Indian tea has to be reduced, as Gulati argues, from Rs 8.74 to Rs 7.20, there is still no case for a reduction in export duty since even at the lower price the Indian tea exporter will have a margin of 23 P per kg. Of course, the Government must keep a constant watch on the situation and take suitable action when exporters are not able to earn a reasonable margin of profit while paying tea producers a remunerative price and remaining competitive in foreign markets. Such a situation, however, has not arisen.||P. R. Sengupta

But it does not provide against possible failure to achieve the ambitious targets set for it. The draft Fourth Plan had implicitly assumed the success of the new strategy and had based its perspective for the rest of the economy on this optimistic assumption. Actually, planning for shortfalls becomes particularly important when success depends, as it does under the new strategy, on a combination of many unpredictable factors and circumstances. There are three elements in planning for failure in agriculture in the present context: (a) provision of an alternative strategy from the very beginning based on more modest assumptions; (b) keeping the administrative and distributive machinery ready to handle a crisis situation; and (c) achieving a high level of comprehensiveness in formulating specific programmes in the sense of taking into account as many as possible of the factors likely to be operative in the actual situation. The third of these three elements in planning for failure forms the theme of this paper.||Rushikesh Maru

The introduction of elective politics in the village has inspired new methods of attacking and defending privilege and status. The composition of the two parallel hierarchies, traditional and elected, may for a time appear similar but they are based on conflicting principles. Conflict may well increase, but through it come mobility and new alignments. Castes other than the dominant caste are beginning to be aware of themselves as corporate political entities and will negotiate as groups to see what they can obtain through their votes. Caste consciousness may thus seem to be strengthened but, simultaneously, relationships between castes are changed and the basis of caste hierarchy is weakened. The existence of factions indicates that the established leadership is not unchallenged and that political authority is not immovably lodged with one group. Factional divisions do not usually reflect competition between prosperous and under-privileged castes, but rather splits within the village elite. The rather contradictory ambitions to have elections in order that local government may be democratic but not to have contests for fear of breaking up the largely mythical solidarity of the village community provide a curious illustration of the conflicts in the ideology of Panchayati Raj. Corrupt practices in panchayat elections represent political behaviour which is radically novel in the Indian village: they have a modernising effect because persons with traditionally higher status are compelled to give money and concessions and even to court pollution in order to secure votes from social inferiors. State elections bring into close relationship the styles and alignments of village politics and the new national forms of political behaviour. They have played a significant part in building up and expressing regional loyalties and have encouraged traditional social groups to mobilise themselves for political action on a broader, State-wise basis. From the voters' angle, the parliamentary contest is an appendage of the assembly contest. The successful parliamentary candidate gains his seat largely through the good offices of his party colleagues, the assembly candidates and local bosses. The assembly contest is between generally wealthy personalities and concerns local issues; the parliamentary contest is generally between parties and about national and international issues but it has an odd epiphenomenal quality because it is so dependent on the more local fight. Consequently, an MP is far more beholden to his party than the average MLA. As compared with the MLA, he is more free from local pressures but he is also more responsive to the party organisation and party discipline - which accounts for the practical absence of defections at the centre, and their high frequency in certain States.||Duncan B.

An attempt is made here to examine this viewpoint which dominated the Community Development Movement in its early years and which, despite the more recent shift in policy in favour of concentrating on raising agricultural production, continues to influence thinking on rural development. Examination of the problems of rural development in any specific context may indeed suggest the need for variegated action to achieve even a single aim and this may appear to justify the all-sided approach. Actually what is called for is not all-sided development but careful choice of those significant elements action in respect of which is necessary for the attainment of the predetermined goal. Here the various components of a programme have an internal logic and have a functional relationship among themselves and with the final goal. The all-sided approach, on the other hand, will lack coherence and, in the absence of a single ultimate objective, is likely to develop contradictions within itself.

24/2/1968- ||special articles||4358294||Exports of the '77': Possibilities and Limits||This article examines the factors which restrict exports of the developing countries with a view to assessing the possibilities and limits of expansion of these exports. Though discussion at UNCTAD II on exports of primary products from the developing countries has been dominated by the question of tariffs, it is non-tariff restrictions, such as quotas and price support policies, which more effectively curb these exports. Further, the developing countries need to ask themselves whether, in the absence of any restraints on their trade, they can produce the necessary exportable surpluses of primary commodities to sustain an expansion in their exports. The impact of tariffs on exports of manufactures from the developing countries is in fact heavier than would seem from the nominal tariff rates since the effective rates are invariably higher. But even in the case of manufactures, non-tariff restrictions are more onerous. Removal of these restrictions involves readiness on the part of the developed countries to make changes in their industrial structures. Even granted this readiness, two questions remain. First, can it be assumed that the absorptive capacity of the developed countries for the kind of manufactures that the developing countries can export will expand at a fast enough pace, or even expand at all? Second, and more important, will the developing countries be able within a reasonable time to establish a comparative cost advantage in a sufficiently wide range of manufactured goods?||J. A. Rosario

Per capita consumption of all grains taken together shows a high income elasticity. Income elasticity of consumption of individual grains is, however, lower and for bajra, jowar and maize it is negative, confirming their 'inferior' grain status. Output is the best determinant of marketable surplus, income the second best and acreage a rather poor one. Efforts to increase the marketable surplus should, therefore, concentrate on raising output. From this point of view, the strategy of intensive cultivation is likely to pay off in terms of higher marketable surplus.||P. P. Sharma

The political leadership may be blamed for indifference, inaction and lassitude; but can any decision or intervention on its part put the house in order unless the scientific community itself learns to be rational and democratic? The problem is not confined to a single organisation or to a single level or echelon within a particular organisation. Growth of science in India is essentially a management problem. The initial mistake after Independence was organisational. We started adding large, complex organisations to the existing bureaucratic structure, thus making it even more centralised and complex instead of creating small, homogeneous, autonomous, goal-oriented research departments or laboratories where management would have been simpler and the objectives easily identified and readily achievable.||Aqueil Ahmad

This brief article carries forward A P Rao's work, published earlier in this journal, of rigorous testing of the hypotheses and results of these Reports. In an unorthodox departure from the linear regression method, the author uses relatively simple tests on disaggregated data and finds that correlation between yield and farm size is spurious. The two variables, he asserts, vary independently of each other.

Part I deals with the set of data on the relationship between values and economic growth, presented in McClelland's studies of achievement motivation. An outdated perspective which regards the international stratification system as the expression of inherent differences between peoples and cultures, has resulted in an erroneous interpretation of data. A more meaningful picture of the data is then presented in terms of the dynamics of social change. Part II briefly outlines the really critical sectors in the underdeveloped social structure where historical conditions may have implanted psychological antipathies to economic growth.

There have been few attempts to use the conflict model to understand the dynamics of the country's political system. This paper attempts to indicate the nature and extent of election violence during the Fourth General Elections. Attention is focussed on the distribution of election violence over the period from the beginning of the election process to its end, the occurrence of violence in the different States, the forms of violence and the extent of involvement, both as aggressors and as victims, of different political parties and interest-groups.

Its identification with a closed stratification system forming an organic whole is being questioned. The observed process of fission and fusion has broken down castes into new endogamous sub-units and there has been at the same time amalgamation of analogous castes for the acquisition of social and political influence. Various levels of segmentation within caste are meaningful for different purposes and activities and the basis of segmentation itself varies greatly from one unit to another. The prominence of class segments within the caste provides for much greater mobility than the earlier sub-castes. Caste, as a primordial tie, persists in the midst of change, retaining its traditional endogamy as the basic primary unit beyond the family. Class divisions assume increasing importance, however, and as class becomes more behaviourally decisive, the bounds of caste are crossed, linking comparable class segments across caste lines on the basis of common interests and associations.

Not much attention has been paid to industrialisation in the agricultural sector. This study of rural electrification in a village in Maharashtra shows that electrification has accelerated the process of modernisation in different segments of village society. The labour-saving impact of electrification has greatly altered the importance of the large joint family and the extended kin group. Electrification is likely to accelerate the spread of education in rural areas and thereby further facilitate modernisation. Similarly some changes are noticeable in the value system as a result of electrification. Ascriptive orientation is gradually being replaced by achievement orientation and competitiveness, individualism, and rationality are slowly replacing the traditional value patterns.||T. N. Valunjkar

Comparison of land revenue with agricultural income-tax, suggests, however, that from the point of ensuring efficient use of land the superiority of land revenue is absolute. Since land revenue is a fixed charge, the marginal rate of tax is zero. Thus the incentives for additional effort and investment to raise the productivity of land are left unimpaired. From the equity point of view, too, while there is a case for introducing a measure of progression in taxing agricultural incomes, economic considerations suggest that this objective can be more effectively secured within the framework of the existing land revenue system.||I.

The occasion was that the 'bhatkars' the big private landlords in Goa, had begun, in anticipation of the land reform measures, to sell off their lands with consequent large-scale eviction of the 'mundkars' whose houses stood on these lands. The Committee's findings reveal that the 'mundkar' system is part of the anachronistic and feudal land tenure system that exists in Goa to this day; that the 'bhatkars' are an old and powerful landlord class sufficiently well organised to hinder legal measures intended to protect the 'mundkars'; and, therefore, that nothing short of sweeping change will alleviate the lot of the 'mundkars' who constitute a major section of the agricultural population in Goa's primarily agricultural economy.||Shrikrishna Vanjari

His attempt to attribute a part of the joint average cost to gas production is economically unsound. On the other hand, Samuel Paul's criticism ignores the fact that gas is also available independently of oil production. The only cost elements which can be attributed to gas in the case of associated gas fields are those of installing and operating permanent transport and storage facilities for gas. For non-associated gas the cost also includes the development and extraction expenditures needed for producing an initial yearly output. The Rao award has overestimated the cost of gas production. Its cost-plus pricing includes in addition to cost, subject to discount, a tax element which is tied with financing the expenditures of ONGC.||Biplab Dasgupta

In their notable contributions published in this journal Bhattacharya (1966), Joseph (1966, 1968) have examined the feasibility of adopting the linear expenditure model of Stone (1954, 1964) for India. In the present study the authors consider a system of non-linear Engel curves as an alternative hypothesis of consumer behaviour. The system of additive logarithmic Engel curves or briefly the 'addilog system', to use Houthakker's (1960, 1961) terminology, serves as a good model to analyse consumer expenditure and to project consumer demand. Among its important properties are: additivity, non-negativity, simplicity, conformity with economic theory, and close agreement with empirical data. The authors work out a simple expression for the variable elasticity and deduce interesting theoretical implications of a rise in income for the consumer expenditure pattern. The theoretical discussions are supplemented by detailed empirical analyses of NSS tenth round data. In conclusion the authors point out the major limitations of their approach and comment on the inadequacy of data and existing econometric methods.

Prior to 1967 the result of every election in the State had been determined largely by the manipulation of block votes by the leaders of the State's four major communal groups-the Nairs, the Ezhavas, the Christians and the Muslims. Though there had always been a great deal of economic and social differentiation within these four communities, this did not prevent them from achieving a high degree of political solidarity. Even in the 1967 elections, the Muslim League fared best where Muslims constituted a high proportion of the population and the stronghold of the Kerala Congress was again the district of Kottayam where the proportion of Christians in the electorate was the highest in the State. But the election results also showed that the Christian and Nair leaders who had tried to swing the support of their respective communities from the Kerala Congress to the Congress were unable to command the same loyalty as in the past. [The article is based on a field study conducted by the author in Kerala at the time of the 1967 General Elections.

But the crash programme has been actually too successful. What the industrial recession, which began in 1965, means is that unemployment among engineering graduates is likely to rise sharply in 1968-70. The situation appears even more dismal if it is remembered that the engineering industry at its present level of production is capable of a 50 to 70 per cent increase in output with only marginal additions to professional and skilled manpower. Along with the excess of low quality engineering degree-holders with no practical factory training and of diploma-holders whose course is a shortened version of the engineering degree without thorough training in workshop practice, production planning and supervision, there is, however, acute shortage of good supervisors. The shortage is worsened by lack of highly skilled and skilled workers. The time has come, therefore, to examine the costs of quantity and the benefits of quality in engineering and industrial training. While the draft Fourth Plan realistically accepted the need to put a brake on the growth in number of engineering colleges and polytechnics, it had few recommendations to link educational change to the problems of raising industrial productivity. This article is an attempt to remedy this defect.||Angus Hone

Caste superiority has been gradually replaced by considerations such as the numerical strength of the candidate's caste, his economic position, or quite simply his popularity, in determining the chances of success in local elections. While the traditional elite still has some control over the sources of power, its hold is loosening. Successive elections have accelerated this process.

This implies that the marketer should have a clear idea of the nature of his market, and should have done initial consumer research. There is a remarkable uniformity in the markets for different types of consumer products. The four most significant socio-economic characteristics to be defined in relation to a particular market are income, education, age groups and degree of urbanisation. Ideally, a test market should be mounted with only one objective in view. Test marketing does not eliminate risk, it only improves knowledge, and reduces the chances of expensive mistakes.||S. L. Rao

These men played a creditable role in the movement but were too young to claim a share in power immediately after Independence, and by the time conditions were propitious for change of leadership they were too old. During the last years of his life Lohia's non-conformism received greater notice than his many insights into the processes of history and politics. To be a non-conformist is a rare enough virtue in a conformist society such as ours, but there was a great deal more to Rammanohar Lohia; he embodied some noble aspirations for his country and represented an important strand of opinion in Indian political life. And in the socialist movement, his was the decisive influence at many critical turning points.||Gopal Krishna

Class and ideological characterisation of the major political parties shows the operation of a variety of competing ideologies, very often within the same party. A secular, modernistic party may be anti-socialist; a regional party may be forward-looking and progressive; a communalist, backward-looking party may believe in an authoritarian state. Talk of political polarisation, it is thus clear, is premature in the present state of political and economic development.||C. P. Bhambhri
25/5/1968- ||special articles||4358660||Nation Building in the Confrontation Phase||All nationalist movements operate on a measure of consensus on the basic issues relating to independence. The consensus continues for some time after independence for the purposes of establishing a new image of the country. Once the aura of the nationalist struggle fades and the leaders face the problems of long-term nation building, they confront a situation where clear choices have to be made. This is the period of confrontation between alternative roads to progress. This period of confrontation is followed by an operational consensus that works till new stresses mature and the process is repeated. Now that the period of confrontation is already upon us, it is necessary for political parties to distinguish between ideological consensus and policy consensus and to seek to achieve the latter even though the former may not be immediately possible. This calls for new postures in politics. Instead of forming a United Front and then sitting down to formulate a common programme, let the parties first pinpoint the urgent issues and their approaches to these problems and then unite around policies.||Manoranjan Mohanty

The concept of India as one country and one people has been put away for use on purely ceremonial occasions. Ministers are kept so busy performing on the tight rope of political support that pressing matters concerning the welfare of the people receive no attention. Even if one abandoned all ethical considerations, one could see that it is inexpedient to adopt bribery and blackmail as the permanent basis of our polity. The author suggests that the Constitution should be amended to give the States an irremovable executive, combining the offices of governor and chief minister, while retaining the parliamentary form at the Centre. The democratic right of people to dismiss their government need not be exercised every morning; once every five years should be enough, to keep the executive and the legislature on their good behaviour.||V.

31/8/1968- ||review of management, august 1968||4359000||Organisational Planning: Some Comments||This paper analyses organisational tasks and discusses three approaches to organisations study, and develops an approach to planning organisation of work. The task of organising requires more than dividing the work into manageable units or laying down authority charts. It requires integration of a set of dynamic forces as well as reconciling the various demands of technology and social factors. The demands vary within the organisation from one operating level to another. There are three distinguishable functional levels in an organisation: first, direction, service and control, second, operating management and third, primary work group level. The nature of demands at all three levels are different and these differences may justify different organisational fit at each level. General principles of organisation applicable to the enterprise as a whole seem neither applicable nor justified. The effectiveness of the organisation depends upon the nature of the task to be done. It must be based on an analysis of the physical activity at the base of the organisational triangle. The tasks at the higher levels of the hierarchy must bear direct relation to the basic tasks at the level of the physical activity. It is suggested that organisational planning must begin with analysis of the tasks at the physical level and only by determining the suitable organisation at this level can other positions be determined. This is so because there must be a direct link between the task at the base of the triangle and those that lie higher up in the hierarchy. Another characteristic of the organisation has to do with the need for having an adaptive organisation which can cope with changes in the environment and those that are induced from within the system of the enterprise.||Ishwar Dayal

Unlike propaganda or publicity, it not only tries to interpret an organisation to its 'publics' but also the public mind to the organisation concerned. Public relations activity is not limited to mass communication. There are many other ways of gaining the goodwill of the community. Public relations is doing ninety per cent good and ten per cent talking about it.||J. M. Kaul

21/12/1968- ||special articles||4359471||Where Labour Policy Has Failed||The Third Five Year Plan seemed to make the simplistic assumption that industrial disputes can be settled by bringing the parties together and independently of any consideration of the underlying economic and technical issues. Consequently, while the Plan set out several sweeping policy objectives for labour problems - from recognition of minimum need-based wages to need for a sustained rise in productivity - and saw the principal instruments of an active labour policy to comprise maintenance of industrial peace, workers' participation in management, and observation of the code of discipline by workers and management, it is difficult to say what Government's labour policy over the three Plan periods has actually amounted to. This is partly because far too many aspects of the matter have tended to get considered simultaneously. The contention of this paper is not that these policy goals and instruments are unsatisfactory, but that both in terms of specific policy prescriptions and capability of instruments to achieve results, a great deal remains to be done and that little effort has been made in this direction.||K.

While cash holdings do limit bank advances, the quantum of deposits is determined not by advances but in virtual independence from the quantum of advances. The bulk of bank deposits is provided not by large scale industry and trade but by individuals who may be inexperienced savers, honest rich men or small traders. One cannot help wondering who in India shows growing attachment to an inferior asset like bank deposits.||Ashok V. Desai

26/10/1968- ||review of agriculture, october 1968||4359231||The New Strategy: Lessons of First Three Years||The impression is widespread that areas covered by the High-Yielding Varieties Programme are given favoured treatment. In fact, there is very little to distinguish the State Governments' agricultural activities in these areas from those elsewhere, except possibly some preference shown in distribution of fertilisers. As in other areas of planning, targets set for the HYVP have been quite often unrealistic - mainly because no one is accountable if they are not fulfilled. Co-ordination between Government departments, panchayati raj institutions and co-operative agencies in the implementation of the Programme has been minimal. Production and distribution of the high-yielding varieties of seeds and expansion of credit facilities have been major weak links in the operation of the HYVP in its first three years. Of crucial importance is selection of areas for propagation of the high-yielding varieties. Given the criteria laid down in the Programme - e g, availability of irrigation, etc - the high-yielding variety of a crop is likely to be most successful where the local variety of the same crop is extensively grown and there is no distinctly more remunerative crop. The new varieties have proved to be markedly susceptible to pests and insects. This, together with the dependence of so much of our irrigation facilities on the rains, introduces an element of uncertainty which, considering the large investments that are called for, is an important factor limiting the spread of the Programme. A crop insurance scheme is imperative if larger number of farmers are to be induced to take to the new technology. The success of HYVP also depends on the price situation. Unless price fluctuations of the type that occurred after the last rabi crop in Haryana and Punjab can be prevented, farmers are unlikely to view with enthusiasm the experimentation and risk-taking which are implicit in the New Strategy.||V.

But, as envisaged by the Reserve Bank and implemented by co-operative banks, it suffers from both inherent and operational defects. Scales of finance are invariably fixed much lower than the actual farm costs and cannot, therefore, be said to provide full farm finance. Procedural inadequacies and delays result in late disbursements. No note is taken of different time-schedules of loans for different crops.||S. N. Ghosal,K. K. Karmarkar,B. K. Goswami

The average size of the household in the early decades of the 19th century was more or less the same as it is now. The assumption of large households in the past has been based on confusion between the household, as a residential unity of patri-kin and their wives, and the family, conceived as an ideal or a legal and emotional entity. Such residential unity was greater in towns than in villages, and in the higher and Sanskritised castes than among others. It is possible that Sanskritisation of lower castes and Adivasi tribes tends to increase and Westernisation to diminish the size of, and the number of relationships in, a household. The author pleads against the assumption that there has been an inevitable trend from large and complex to small and simple households. There is need to have a fresh look at the problems of the impact of industrialisation and urbanisation on the household.||A. M. Shah

The sponsors of scientific R & D are interested in delineating its areas, fixing the time schedule for completion of projects, and regulating the flow of resources to be devoted for the furtherance of such research activities. This gives rise to problems of programming at project and national levels. A model has been developed here to study inter-sectoral relationship with R & D as an active sector. The concept of Research Co-efficient has been expressed in value terms as against the traditional method of treating such co-efficients in fixed physical terms. It is suggested that the model can be extended to a broader framework which would be, partly, stochastic and, partly, deterministic.

Contrary to general belief, the import of crude oil will not require more foreign exchange; in fact, on the basis of all reasonable expectations regarding the prices of hydrocarbons, it will be import-saving. If the fertiliser industry is to use naphtha rather than imported ammonia, the question arises of how much naphtha and other hydrocarbons we should produce. Unless there is reason to expect a sharp rise in world prices of petroleum products or fall in Indian production costs, 36 million tonnes of refining capacity in 1975 and 50 million tonnes in 1980 are the maxima we can aim at. There is a strong justification for taking these figures also as minimum targets.||Ashok V. Desai,Ramesh K. Bhatia

30/11/1968- ||review of management, november 1968||4359386||Profit Reporting by Diversified Companies||The recent emergence of a large number of conglomerate companies with diversified product lines is largely due to acquisitions of other companies and the setting up of new activities as divisions within existing companies. Initial official opposition to such diversification has been overcome by court rulings and the attractions of higher profitability. Managements are by and large extremely allergic to the idea of profit reporting by divisions. This article examines the reasons cited against divisional profit reporting and finds that none of these make out a strong enough case against it. The question now is not whether conglomerates should report profits by divisions or not but whether industry, Government and accountants are able to develop the right principles for doing so.||S. K.

Minimisation of the cost of tax collection must be an important objective of budgetary policy. The purpose of this article is to analyse the cost of collecting the various Central taxes in the country, to work out their fixed and marginal costs and their particular cost elasticities. The period covered is 1950-51 to 1966-67. It is generally found that, if the cost of collecting taxes is the sole criterion for choosing between the various taxes, then of major Central taxes, customs duties are preferable to both excise duties and income tax and excise duties are preferable to income tax. Direct taxes, that is, are costlier to collect than indirect taxes.||Mahfooz Ahmed

Such dependence on the export of a single commodity or mineral has some important implications for the formulation of monetary policy. An attempt is made here to bring out the more important of these implications. Although the subject is discussed specifically in the Zambian context; the analytical framework is couched in sufficiently general terms so as to be of some relevance to other economies more or less similarly situated. The intention is primarily to illustrate the role of monetary policy in an export economy rather than to chalk out any specific lines of action for a particular country.||N. A. Mujumdar

25/5/1968- ||review of management, may 1968||4358667||The Advertising Agency: A New Service||Advertising agencies have carried most of the burden of the rapid growth of advertising business in the last decade as the major advertisers have not expanded their advertisement departments to any appreciable extent. The agencies have responded to the challenge by reaching out towards greater sophistication and diversification of services offered. But, while the growth of professional management has led to greater recognition of their important role in the marketing cycle, advertising agencies are still rarely given the status of consultants. They continue to be treated as useful tools, not as experts in a specialised field. Advertising agencies are also circumscribed by low rates of return. Major agencies earn between 0.5 and 1 per cent on gross turnover. If agencies are to enter the operations research area for budget and media planning and for developing models of consumer behaviour patterns, they will need to make large investments in men and skills. The basic problem today is how to finance these investments.||Subrata Banerjee

12/10/1968- ||special articles||4359174||Changing Geography of Representation: Parliamentary Constituencies from 1951 to 1966||The principle of uniformity of size of electoral districts was accepted by the Constituent Assembly and the Constitution fixed maximum and minimum limits. However, the population explosion after Independence made it difficult to stick to them and the limits initially fixed by the Constitution-makers were dropped in 1953 and 1956 by amendment of Article 81 of the Constitution. To what extent can the principle of uniform size of electoral districts be followed in a situation of rapid demographic change without doing harm to other aspects of political development? Continuous adjustments in boundaries of constituencies handicap political parties by keeping their organisational structures in constant flux and by heightening the element of uncertainty in electoral contests contribute to the general instability of the party system. More important, frequent adjustments prevent development of a corporate identity for the constituency and make aggregation of different interests difficult since the interests keep changing constantly as a result of boundary changes. How far has recognition of these problems informed the process of delimitation of constituencies in India? This article discusses the rules, procedures and mechanics of delimitation and examines, from the standpoint of their political impact, the outcome of the four major delimitations carried out between the first and fourth general elections.||R.

Recoveries are low and difficult. Commercial banks can succeed where the co-operatives have failed only if they provide extension services and train their staff accordingly. Contract buying of produce is one way of ensuring loan recovery. Such contracts have made headway in commercial crops, but they have not been tried for foodgrains.||B. V. Nimbkar

21/12/1968- ||special articles||4359472||Rattle All the Way: Tariff Commission Evades Policy||The recent Report on Continuance of Protection to the Automobile Industry clearly shows the deterioration in the quality of the Tariff Commission's work over the years. The Commission has not only fought shy of making judgment on different aspects of the automobile industry's growth, it has not even taken the trouble to get at the basic facts - about capacity, indigenous content, etc - and has taken the easy way out by accepting without question the industry's claims. Nor is there any discernible link between the Commission's findings, such as they are, and its recommendations. The Commission accepts the industry's argument that no reduction in cost of cars is possible even if existing manufacturers are allowed to expand production substantially. Since economies of scale are so pronounced in automobile manufacture the world over, this can only mean that there is something basically wrong with the structure of the Indian industry. Yet the Commission makes no recommendations for structural change and even rules against setting up of a new unit. Further, it argues that three makes of passenger cars are not too many, ignoring the fact that all the three are roughly in the same engine power and passenger capacity range. If the Tariff Commission's Report does scant justice to the complexity of issues involved in orderly development of the automobile industry, Government's decisions on the Report are jejune. Most astounding is the freedom now given to manufacturers to market new models provided no additional use of foreign exchange is involved. This is a complete, and unwarranted, reversal of the policy followed so far, of keeping down the number of models, which was designed to achieve greater standardisation and cost economies.||Arthagnani

The incidence of the land tax is then measured for Uttar Pradesh on a per-acre, per-cultivator, and per-acre productivity basis, both in absolute terms and as a proportion to the per-acre and per-cultivator gross and net agricultural produce. Only the actually taxed area and taxed cultivators are considered, contrary to usual practice which, by spreading the tax over all cultivated land and all cultivators, gives a distorted idea of actual incidence.||D.

23/3/1968- ||special articles||4358404||Dollar Devaluation Inevitable||The US balance of payments deficit has become chronic and the country's gold stocks have touched an all-time low. But in bridging its payments gap, the US does not have much latitude in pruning foreign aid or the outflow of private capital. Even if the US Government could countenance the implications for the country's position as a world power of a sharp cut in foreign aid, it can hardly ignore that a large part of US aid is tied to purchases from the US and that a reduction in aid would certainly lead to a decline in exports as well. Similarly, there are fairly narrow limits to what can be done to curb the outflow of private capital. For, American private investments abroad add to the ability and willingness of other countries to purchase goods and services from the United States so that a cut in investments is bound to affect US exports. Private investments abroad, moreover, are a valuable source of regular and ever-increasing flow of investment income into the US. The only solution to the US balance of payments problem, then is faster growth of American exports. But this cannot be achieved unless American goods are made competitive in international markets by devaluing the dollar. Devaluation of the dollar, it is argued here, has thus become inevitable.||Suresh Chandra Srivastava,Rishi Mani Dubey

The spate of election petitions complaining of irregularities shows that partisan considerations lead the contestants to indulge in malpractices. It, therefore, devolves upon the agencies responsible for electoral adjudication to restore the confidence of the electorate in the elections by quickly disposing of the election petitions in a manner which guarantees fair play and justice. This paper discusses, first, the process of electoral adjudication in India; second, the incidence of election petitions and the nature of complaints; third, the role of the judiciary in the disposal of these petitions; and, finally, the nature of political influence on decisions of the judiciary. [The data on which this paper is based has been processed at the Data Unit of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, Delhi.
