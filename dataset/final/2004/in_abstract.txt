In hard rock areas, the life of irrigation wells and their groundwater yield is gradually declining due to many factors especially the interference of irrigation wells due to violation of isolation distance among wells, overdraft of groundwater, etc. Interference among wells is a negative externality. This study is a modest attempt to estimate the impact of WDP in reducing the cumulative interference externality by augmenting groundwater recharge for irrigation in Basavapura watershed in Gowribidanur, a drought prone area in Karnataka.||M.

This paper traces the transformation of the rice economy of Bangladesh over the past two decades. It examines the factors behind the growth in rice production and the role of market-oriented policy reforms, particularly in respect of the liberalisation and privatisation of agricultural input markets. The paper argues in favour of strengthening the role of the private sector in input markets while emphasising larger allocations of public resources for agricultural research and water resource development.||Raisuddin Ahmed

This study of two districts located in the Western Ghats in Karnataka reveals that JFM schemes seeking to place degraded lands under plantations have neglected the dependence of the local people on 'kans' - sacred groves - present in both districts. Local people till recently retained management rights over these evergreen tracts. In the interests of conservation and to obtain a sustained revenue from NTFP products, it is necessary for the government to involve the local people in the management of the kans.||Yogesh Gokhale

Its public irrigation systems are performing far below par. As a direct consequence, farmers are turning to groundwater for their irrigation needs. Booming groundwater irrigation has become the mainstay of Indian farming but it has also all but wrecked the country's power economy because of perverse policies of pricing of electricity for agriculture. Yet, there is no firm strategy of dealing with these and other challenges. Other south Asian countries are in much the same boat. Based on two spells of fieldwork in six provinces of north China, this article shows that, facing much the same problems as its south Asian neighbours, China is responding differently to its water problems. This is by no means a suggestion that the approaches China is trying out would work in India - or even in China itself. However, by including China's experience in its discussions, Indian policy-makers will clearly have a wider repertoire of institutional alternatives with which to experiment.||Tushaar Shah,Mark Giordano,Jinxia Wang

Using the postulate that expectations of regular and steady returns from non-timber forest produce (NTFP) constitute the backbone of preservation-oriented extraction by village communities, this study attempts to identify and quantify the range of benefits other than the returns from the illegal felling and sale of timber obtained by these communities due to the existence of the forest, so that policy can be formulated on this basis.||Madhumati Dutta,Souvanic Roy,Shubhayu Saha,Dibyendu S.

Particularly after 1992, Mexico has implemented serious, comprehensive and far-reaching water sector reforms that required the government to create a new legal framework; restructure existing water administration; promote and support a plurality of new autonomous and quasi-autonomous water institutions; modify incentives in water use to different user groups; and struggle with a vast complex of unresolved operational issues in implementing the reforms. Mexico may not be a model for India but Mexico's experience does suggest that changing the way a nation manages its water resources necessitates far-reaching changes in administration, institutional structure, law and operating rules, incentives and power structures, and above all consistent commitment to the reform process.||Tushaar Shah,Christopher Scott,Stephanie Buechler

Since courts were unable to provide adequate redressal under general practice because of legal delays, higher litigation cost and complicated legal procedures, the courts introduced public interest litigation. The inferences drawn from the empirical work analysed in the light of the theory of the liability system reveal that the courts are unable to provide incentives to the tortfeasor because of informational disadvantages in the case of scientific knowledge, legal delays, poor monitoring of implementation of orders, etc. There is thus a need to improve the functioning of the liability system by making necessary changes not only in the substance of the law, but also in the working conditions of the courts to protect and improve environmental quality in India.||P.

Technically trained people are especially crucial in spreading such awareness because within the existing structures of society, professional credentials largely determine how a person's opinion is perceived and received. Flashing professional credentials is a double-edged sword. The establishment can and does field large numbers of scientists to support their policies. Their prominence is why many people believe in profoundly wrong ideas about nuclear issues at times. Some examples of such mistaken ideas are nuclear weapons preserve peace and nuclear reactors generate cheap electricity. Many of these claims have been disproved by other scientists. But because scientists from powerful institutions like the DAE have much greater access to the media and are sometimes the only scientists that most people ever hear about, anti-establishment scientists face an uphill battle. One way to fight this unequal battle is for scientists to not limit themselves to nuclear weapons issues but also challenge the power of the establishment that manufactures and peddles these weapons in a variety of ways, including on ethical, moral, economic, environmental, and public health grounds.||M.

The paper disagrees with the concept that river basins can be mechanically divided as 'surplus' or 'deficit' ones, and views the proposed interlinking as an extremely cost-ineffective measure for the expansion of a rather inefficient traditional irrigation process. Thus, in the event of the mega-project being taken up as it is, it will lead to sub-optimal use of the water resources of the country through a huge and unwise investment.

ITP has conducted a collaborative inter-disciplinary research programme on such local and national water policy issues and discussion papers that capture its results were presented at a recent three-day meet.||Tushaar Shah

A major hydrological opportunity for rejuvenation of the aquifer system is provided by the availability of unutilised flows from Narmada basin. It is proposed to divert this water to north Gujarat through the Narmada main canal, and use the existing canal networks and village ponds and tanks in the region to activate a decentralised recharge process. This paper examines its physical and economic feasibility. An evaluation of two recharge scenarios in north Gujarat shows that using pumped water for recharging outside the designated command area may prove to be an uneconomical proposition, unless there is substantial increase in the productivity of water. Recharge within the command would be much more economical.||Rahul Ranade,M. Dinesh Kumar

The last such programme was the World Bank-aided Flood Action Plan launched with great hope. Today three-fourths of Bangladesh is under floodwaters.||Anu Muhammad

The project was to blaze a new trail in farmer-participatory irrigation project design and management with water user associations building their own distribution systems. However, as it unfolds, the institutional reality of the project is vastly different from its plans. If SSP is to chart a different course from scores of earlier large irrigation projects, it must invent and put into place new rules of the irrigation management game.||Jayesh Talati,Tushaar Shah

In Gujarat, monitoring cells required to be set up to keep watch on CAD activities have still not been set up. In the case of the SSP, water distribution systems have not been constructed by user associations, and access to Narmada water has been cornered by the powerful, pump-owning lobby.||Himanshu Upadhyaya
