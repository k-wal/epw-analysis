Although Maldivian women enjoy a relatively high status in society, several factors constrain them from full and unfettered participation in national development. There is a need for a gender mainstreaming approach that operates effectively and expeditiously to bring about change in the socio-economic status of women.||A. M. Shaljan

The proposed legislation should not put in place a weak and diluted jobs programme.||Mihir Shah

Citizens of Dayhoit are reaching out to other affected sections and are waging a collective campaign against the corporation, the county and federal administration.||Mukul

This declining diversity has serious repercussions in terms of overuse of natural resources, ecological problems and growing income risk. As diversity in the production pattern declines, variability in the gross value of production also increases.||Joginder Singh,R. S. Sidhu

The silence of the draft on how customary rights of access to and use of environmental resources are to be integrated with formal policy, law and the rights framework is deafening.||Videh Upadhyay

But the law falls short of ensuring that stakeholder views are incorporated in the final decision. In order to develop partnerships among the public, industry and government with the aim of assuring sustainable development, the public hearing process needs to be strengthened.||Rohini Chaturvedi
23/10/2004-29/10/2004||commentary||4415698||National Environment Policy: Ascendance of Economic Factors||The NEP approach to conservation strategy emphasises giving primacy to economic instruments and facilitating economic valuation of environmental resources and services. However, it falls short of the ideal in several key areas, including its lack of attention to the preservation of biodiversity. The NEP needs to be amended to proclaim unambiguously the national commitment to conserve invaluable biodiversity and to enshrine stakeholder-based biodiversity conservation as the principal concern of environmental policy.||C.

While other development interventions are also important and necessary, public investments in assuring improved irrigation water control can act to kick-start the tribal economy in the region.||Sanjiv J.

Since courts were unable to provide adequate redressal under general practice because of legal delays, higher litigation cost and complicated legal procedures, the courts introduced public interest litigation. The inferences drawn from the empirical work analysed in the light of the theory of the liability system reveal that the courts are unable to provide incentives to the tortfeasor because of informational disadvantages in the case of scientific knowledge, legal delays, poor monitoring of implementation of orders, etc. There is thus a need to improve the functioning of the liability system by making necessary changes not only in the substance of the law, but also in the working conditions of the courts to protect and improve environmental quality in India.||P.

Three recent meets brought out a wide range of aspects influencing investors and affecting locals in the process of such development.||Ramachandra Bhatta

The transfer of state of the art technologies on favourable terms, including on concessional and preferential terms has always been a missing component in this trade.||Sandeep Singh,Rajeev Kher

However, it falls seriously short of pointing to fundamental changes required in development and planning with regard to natural resources that would put India onto a path of sustainable development. Moreover, it has been formulated in a largely non-participatory manner, failing to involve most sections of the populace who depend on natural resources for life and livelihood reasons.||Ashish Kothari
20/11/2004-26/11/2004||special articles||4415805||Scientists, Nuclear Weapons, and the Peace Movement||The greatest challenge any scientist interested in advancing nuclear disarmament in south Asia is to sensitise the public at large to nuclear perils. Technically trained people are especially crucial in spreading such awareness because within the existing structures of society, professional credentials largely determine how a person's opinion is perceived and received. Flashing professional credentials is a double-edged sword. The establishment can and does field large numbers of scientists to support their policies. Their prominence is why many people believe in profoundly wrong ideas about nuclear issues at times. Some examples of such mistaken ideas are nuclear weapons preserve peace and nuclear reactors generate cheap electricity. Many of these claims have been disproved by other scientists. But because scientists from powerful institutions like the DAE have much greater access to the media and are sometimes the only scientists that most people ever hear about, anti-establishment scientists face an uphill battle. One way to fight this unequal battle is for scientists to not limit themselves to nuclear weapons issues but also challenge the power of the establishment that manufactures and peddles these weapons in a variety of ways, including on ethical, moral, economic, environmental, and public health grounds.||M.

A project in Nepal has the dual objective of raising incomes of poor families in the hill regions through the production of fodder and fuel and improving the ecological conditions of the hills. Surveys since the project was introduced have indicated an increase in the average period of food self-sufficiency in every involved household. The increase in local food security was also reflected in a decline in migration; there were also indirect effects due to the decrease in women's time spent in fodder and fuel collection.||Girija Shrestha,Dev Nathan

In the present atmosphere of conviviality, platforms of cooperation like SAARC offer scope to set in place new institutions that can work towards solving and mitigating some of the more persistent environmental problems.||U.

They are victims of defined and undefined boundaries and borders in the seas, and increasing conflicts over renewable resources. These coastal conflicts need to be understood from several overlapping but distinct perspectives. Low-intensity conflicts over environmental concerns are as serious as conventional war and simultaneously question cartographic and border anxieties of these countries.||Charu Gupta,Mukul Sharma
