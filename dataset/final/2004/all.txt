In hard rock areas, the life of irrigation wells and their groundwater yield is gradually declining due to many factors especially the interference of irrigation wells due to violation of isolation distance among wells, overdraft of groundwater, etc. Interference among wells is a negative externality. This study is a modest attempt to estimate the impact of WDP in reducing the cumulative interference externality by augmenting groundwater recharge for irrigation in Basavapura watershed in Gowribidanur, a drought prone area in Karnataka.||M.

It examines the factors behind the growth in rice production and the role of market-oriented policy reforms, particularly in respect of the liberalisation and privatisation of agricultural input markets. The paper argues in favour of strengthening the role of the private sector in input markets while emphasising larger allocations of public resources for agricultural research and water resource development.||Raisuddin Ahmed

The decomposability property of Theil index makes it possible to show that manufacturing pay inequality in India has risen both across sectors and across regions, though more strongly across sectors. The paper also shows that the rise in inequality accelerates in the period following the introduction of reforms, after controlling for changes in the level of real per capita income. It appears that a large part of rising manufacturing pay inequality in the post-reform period can be attributed to rising relative pay in the electricity sector.||James K.

The analysis broadly follows the evolutionary theoretical framework. It is argued that differences among firms in terms of technology acquisition explain much of the firm level variation in growth. To incorporate firm specific and inter-temporal changes, the study has used two-way fixed effects estimation of the growth function. The results of this exercise support the view that inter-firm differences in growth in this industry in India are determined by variables capturing technology paradigm and trajectory shifts. The changing role of technology acquisition variables in determining growth is also borne out by the results of this exercise. Further, if one accounts for the role of technology, vertical integration, capital intensity and the age of the firm, size of the firm does provide a firm with positive advantages to grow.||K.

Unless there is enough emphasis on sensitisation at the workplace, legal changes are hardly likely to be successful. Workplaces need to frame their own comprehensive policies on how they will deal with sexual harassment. Instead of cobbling together committees at the court's intervention, a system and a route of redress should already be in place. The draft bill on sexual harassment attempts to address some of the complexities of this issue, but much more clarity and specificity is needed to avoid the creation of a law that might need another extended campaign of reform.||Sheba Tejani

A combination of national and state level factors was responsible for the party's success. While the NDA government's performance at the centre was viewed favourably, the party was also successful in weaning away the support of large sections of adivasis, dalits and OBCs from the opposition chiefly made up of the Congress and other smaller parties. Besides, the organisational support provided by other Sangh parivar bodies considerably assisted the BJP in its victory. For the Congress, the other player that has dominated Rajasthan's two-party electoral system, the defeat conveyed more worrying signals - of its inability to contain factional infighting and also its failure to build up a convincing social cohesion of castes and communities.||Sanjay Lodha

Major theories propounded by the neoclassical regional school, institutionalists, political economists and, finally, modern geographers have been interpreted with reference to their strengths and weaknesses. Though modern geographers do provide a sensible analysis of the causes of uneven development, the perpetuation of backwardness in a developing country context awaits deeper thinking. Moreover, the rise of a strange brand of apolitical neo-localism in recent decades has further diluted any meaningful quest in this direction. Given this, typical interventionist strategies, based upon experiences of matured capitalist societies, are still uncritically tried out in developing countries as possible solutions to the problematic of uneven development and regionalism.||Keshab Das

Husbands' Involvement in Maternal Care of Young Wives||Analysis of a survey area in Maharashtra shows that a majority of husbands were knowledgeable about prenatal, delivery and postnatal care. Men were often excluded from participating in routine care because the medical system does not accommodate them and the community considers maternal care as exclusively women's domain. Young, newly married women experience pregnancy and childbearing in an environment where they have little or no autonomy in decision-making, finances or mobility to seek care. Thus, it may be crucial to get husbands involved, since they are often the decision-makers, the ones who have to accompany the young woman to a clinic and the ones who pay for care.||Alka Barua,Rohini P.

But, as a matter of practice, these rules as applied by Indian courts lead to various kinds of uncertainties regarding the compensation awards. Such uncertainties not only defeat the stated objective of the law of torts, but also cause economic inefficiency. Uncertainties, among other things, result in avoidable wastage of resources, since they induce more litigation by reducing the chances of out-of-court settlement. Many of these uncertainties can be reduced significantly, if courts make use of the relevant tools and techniques developed in the field of economics and statistics.||Ram Singh

An attempt has also been made to link the proximate criterion in literacy in the couple domain with outcome variables such as SLI, instances of sickness among women from specific diseases as asthma, TB, malaria and jaundice; linkages with indicators like under-nutrition in women have also been analysed. The exercise affirms the advantage of proximate illiteracy over the secluded illiterate in terms of outcome measures of women and child health as well as household SLI. On the other hand, while patterns are not distinct in terms of a comparison between proximate female illiterate and proximate male literate, indications point to the latter doing comparatively better.||Srijit Mishra,Udaya Shankar Mishra

It explains the distinction between worsening deficit and debt conditions using time period simulators with relevant variables from the Domar debt model. It shows that a rising debt ratio, which might appear to be due to unfavourable interest rate dynamics, can be related to a previous rise in the primary deficit. The Finance Commission mandated centre-state transfers are predicated upon economic performance indicators based on the revenue deficit; the validity of the consensus view is then critical in evaluating the efficacy of the transfer criteria.||Vivek Moorthy

The unions accomplished this mission through strategies aimed at enhancing the content of 'substantive rights' - wages, hours of work and working conditions - and at minimising income inequalities between the incumbents and new entrants to the world of work. A return to this earlier emphasis on non-competing groups has assumed strategic importance in today's global economy. The paper discusses some options before the labour movement with special reference to the developing countries. There is much to learn from union experience in industrial societies, where they have made substantive rights accessible to a broad spectrum of workers including those at the lower end of markets. By building on such rights, the labour movement can help develop a social floor for the global economy, empowering workers to gain access to a larger basket of rights and entitlements.||A. V. Jose

It finds that manufacturing workers are more literate today than they were in 1983. It also presents a labour quality index based on the Jorgenson, Gallop, and Fraumeni methodology for both the rural and urban sectors of the states. The labour quality indices show that quality changes have been quite slow and there is a lot of variation among states in both the rural and urban sectors. The association of the labour quality index with the state's characteristics is found to be weak, but the urban labour quality index has stronger links with the human development index of the states, urban poverty ratio of the state, number of ITIs, and the intensity of industrialisation.||Suresh Chand Aggarwal

As the Y V Reddy Committee had pointed out, even the benchmarked determination of administered rates of interest on small savings can only be viewed as an interim measure, pending pension fund reforms and an old age security scheme. In the meantime, the savers have to be exposed to more realistic yield rates. This, the reversal of policy prevents from being achieved and in turn it is likely to hinder the final reform process.||EPW Research Foundation

To empirically verify the extent of domestic and international knowledge spillovers we have followed endogenous growth approach and wisdom from new international trade theory. We find strong productivity effects from industry's own R and D as well as domestic and foreign knowledge spillovers. International knowledge spillovers transmitted by trade played dominant role in explaining productivity growth in the Korean manufacturing industries during the 1970s and 1980s, but the international knowledge spillovers did not play any significant role in the 1990s. This empirical finding has strong implications for the Korean technology policy as well as for the strict intellectual property rights regime enacted by the WTO.||Lakhwinder Singh

The paper shows that paddy and wheat cultivators are the major beneficiaries of fertiliser subsidy. Interstate disparity in fertiliser consumption still remains high, though it has been falling over the years. More significant is the finding that there prevails a fair degree of inter-class equity in distribution of fertiliser subsidy, contrary to the widely prevalent impression. A uniform approach to reduction of all types of subsidies is not justified. Instead a well thought out, properly sequenced, gradualist and regionally differentiated approach to subsidy reduction needs to be adopted.||Richa Singh

The policy stance has been to put in place a tariff structure comparable to international standards particularly to that of its immediate competitors. Against this backdrop, this study has examined the uniform tariff rates in the Indian context. The study is a logical step forward to the recommendations in Kelkar Report (2002) and approaches broadly the recommendations of the Inter-Ministerial Group on Custom Tariff Structure (2001) set up by the government of India. The study recommends a uniform tariff rate at 15 per cent for all import items including defence with effect from April 1, 2004. In terms of handling the transitional problem, the study suggests the creation of Drug Fund and Defence Fund. The proceeds from the Drug Fund could be utilised for assisting primary health and from the Defence Fund for rehabilitating the defence personnel and their families.||Jayanta Roy,R. K. Pattnaik

Nine indicators from education, health, nutrition and other social sectors measure the index of basic welfare as the output of government efforts. Revenue and capital expenditures of state governments on the economic (physical capital) sectors and social (human capital) sectors are considered over two decades - 1971-81 and 1981-91 to examine the stability of the coefficients.||Archana R.

Nevertheless, it may be too early to conclude that Uttaranchal is heading for a two-party political system, given the substantial chunk of votes cornered by other parties.

The ensuing dilemma of reconciliation between the liberal (individual) spirit and the concerns of community has long remained a test for India's democracy. Contemporary India, especially in its north-east, confronts a scrambling competition among groups to be heard and recognised as historical victims of subordination. Competition among these groups leads to a reinvention of symbols and other mechanisms of ensuring 'boundaries' to maintain their political primacy. Such conflicts while institutionalising ethnic entitlement and rights also reinforce the unequal status of the citizen and fuel a process of 'inequalisation' of ethnic 'others' in the region.||Rajesh Dev

While women and children make up a majority of the forcibly displaced, international humanitarian discourses confer on them a presumed passivity that is naturalised in practice. Systems of care and protection even in UNHCR camps remain largely gender insensitive especially in south Asia where national laws reinforce gender discrimination. This paper uses a gender sensitive perspective, analysing the way a woman as a refugee subject is configured as a non-person so as to gain fresh insights on the 'infantilisation' and 'de-maturation' of the refugee experience. Moreover, it raises questions on the secondary status women occupy as citizens in south Asian polities.||Rita Manchanda

But in the early 1970s Kerry participated in mass rallies against the Vietnam war and appeared at Congressional hearings to recount atrocities that he and fellow servicemen witnessed or committed as an inevitable by-product of misbegotten American policy. That same passion and acute sense of principle, if aroused again and backed up with deeds, would guarantee Kerry a landslide victory in November.||Kurt Jacobsen

Availability-based tariff (ABT), as an economic instrument, has successfully addressed both the issues: rationalise the tariff structure and ensure quality supply at the grid-level by defining a playing rule for both the generators and the beneficiary states.

Where education is concerned, not only do girls lag behind, but also certain communities and classes fare worse than others. The aim of this paper is twofold. Firstly, to highlight the factors responsible for this inequality for both boys and girls from socially deprived origins, and secondly, to highlight in particular the inequality faced by girls at each educational transition stage. The paper uses a unique National Election Study (1996) data set that contains information on the respondent and the respondent's parent's caste, class, religion and locality. The major results of this study are only partly consistent with previous research. There was weak support for the effect of caste, but class on the other hand emerged as a strong determinant of the relative chance of a child continuing in school. No support was found for an additional class effect where the education of girls is concerned, thus refuting the notion of a more egalitarian Indian middle class.||Divya Vaid

An interesting feature of the simple cooperatives we discuss is that perhaps they benefit only the poor and not those who are better off and have access to mainstream credit and markets.||Murali Patibandla,Trilochan Sastry

It seems to be a system that was conceived for a world where people were expected to do what they were told, and things happened as they were meant to. The real challenge, whether public control remains or not, is to create a banking system for a world where investors take risk and sometimes fail, where bankers need to take initiative and use their judgment. We need incentives for bankers that reward success but make allowances for bad luck, which at the same time guard against the temptation to be irresponsible or corrupt.||Abhijit Banerjee,Esther Duflo

Over the years, the conduct of elections has assumed the tone of a comprehensively orchestrated exercise, under the aegis of the Election Commission, a constitutionally mandated body. In the last decade, a series of reforms have been implemented in the election process such as the introduction of photo identity cards and electronic voting machines. This article attempts a survey of voters in the Lok Sabha elections of 2004, to assess voter views on the electoral system and their perceptions with regard to recent changes introduced by the EC.

This paper carries out a comparative static analysis using a gravity model and simulates the increase in India-Bangladesh bilateral trade under four hypothetical scenarios of differing tariff rate cuts. The results show that in a free trade regime, the increase in India's exports will be more than the increase in its imports from Bangladesh. Non-tariff barriers (NTB) are also a major deterrent to Bangladesh's exports to India, as India's NTB coverage ratio is much higher than Bangladesh.||Swapan K. Bhattacharya

An Empirical Investigation||The relationship between fiscal deficit and the rate of interest is still an unsettled issue. Theoretically, at least in neo-classical sense, funding of government requirements through market borrowings would not only induce rise in interest rates, but the increased funding cost in turn would also contribute to the rise in fiscal deficit. In the Indian context, the coexistence of falling interest rates and growing size of fiscal deficit in the recent years, however, seems to suggest that the causation between the two does not hold. Further, there is empirical evidence suggesting one-way causality running only from real interest rate to fiscal deficit. This paper re-examines this issue and argues that the absence of an apparent fiscal impact on interest rate is essentially the result of higher liquidity in the system. Empirical results drawn through a VAR model show that there is a two-way causality between gross fiscal deficit and the real interest rate.||Rajan Goyal

A century ago, politicians, educators, editors and writers also debated 'what was best for the child'. With the growth of print culture in the early 20th century, a journalistic venture emerged in the Hindi public sphere that was closely tied to the nationalist project: children's journals. Hindi children's journals propelled the view that it lay in the hands of children to support and eventually accomplish Indian independence. The editors of children's journals staked out an agenda that emphasised character formation and argued against superstition and materialism. This agenda was characterised by a self-reflexive application of new discourses in child pedagogy. It also attained to the requirements of the mainstream nationalist ideology.||Shobna Nijhawan

In the process two key terms have emerged clearly: modernity and capitalism. Although both are deeply interrelated in terms of their historical development, popular discourse in social science has long been dealing with them separately - their interdependence being given lip-service, if at all it is acknowledged. But modernity and capitalism have to be treated not as two different poles, but as parts of the same process; old value-markers that see modernity as 'good' and capitalism as 'bad', need to be transcended. New narratives of the state, capital and the changing colours of modernity are yet to be produced. Such narratives may help in reconstructing the history of globalisation in India as a history of capitalist-modernity.||Abhay Kumar Dubey

It describes the convergence among major parties about the need for embracing global economic integration. This has necessitated gradual privatisation and the consequent need to regulate investment. The growing importance of private investment has produced the federal market economy, which has generated growth with inequality. Good governance in the backward states is especially critical for balanced development in the context of the federal market economy.||Rahul Mukherji

Such an ageing process suggests the need for a multi-pillared income security system. The analysis of this paper that focuses on three major income security plans for the aged reveals that the government is instead working to dilute much of its responsibilities. This study strongly argues for (i) strengthening of the social assistance programme for older persons and modification of the ceiling formula used for capping the size of its beneficiaries; (ii) providing a guarantee against diminution of investments in the reformed pension policy, and (iii) devising long-term old age savings instruments with higher terminal yield.||Moneer Alam

While it is almost 'natural' for immigration research to link migration to larger issues of the receiving society such as employment, cultural coherence and political solidarity, emigration is rarely examined in relation to the sending society's welfare.

Later, the party's defeat and subsequent slide in parliament was attributed to its espousal of the themes of liberalisation and privatisation. This article analyses the results of surveys conducted after the three successive Lok Sabha elections of 1996, 1998 and 1999.

The consensus from earlier NSS rounds, that poverty reduction had been set back during the 1990s, was challenged by this data. This was bolstered by some 'adjustments', which although agreeing that the 55th round had overestimated poverty reduction, claimed that the number of poor had nonetheless fallen by 30-45 million. However, a detailed re-examination shows that these 'adjustments' were not correct. The poverty ratio fell at most by 3 percentage points between 1993-94 and 1999-2000, and it is likely that the number of poor increased over this period. The main lesson is that poverty estimates are very sensitive to both survey design and post-survey analysis. The first of a two-part article.||Abhijit Sen,Himanshu

In the more impersonal government accounts, refugees formed part of a vast logistical exercise. They had to be housed in camps, issued voter and ration cards and, in some cases, provided due compensation. But each individual refugee story is a tale of individual loss, of escape and survival in a new land; a narrative rendered especially poignant by the sudden whiff of nostalgia for a lost homeland or 'desh'. In the more jingoistic present, 'desh' has taken on a connotation similar to the patriotic fervour, 'nation' evokes. However, for refugees, as the personal narratives in this article reveal, 'desh' will forever remain in place as one's homeland, now only sustained by memories.||Anasua Basu Raychaudhury

The two broad schemes that have been envisaged, would take at least a decade or two to be established before their benefits can be rightly availed by those most in need. The public health service system in the country, on the other hand, while catering to large segments of the population, has overreached itself. In this situation, bringing in a mix of providers, including private and private-not-for-profit entities, offers a more feasible arrangement. At the same time, a significant share of healthcare services needs to be retained within the public health system as a counterpoise to the possible market distortion by the private health system.||Javid A.

Two important questions that must be asked to establish whether or not reservations make a difference for political outcomes and governance are (a) do panchayat leaders matter at all and (b) do they make decisions that better reflect the interest of their own groups? This paper summarises findings from a research project on local decentralisation conducted in two districts of West Bengal and Rajasthan. The findings establish that reservation introduced as a tool to ensure adequate representation also assists in adequate delivery of local public goods to disadvantaged groups.||Raghabendra Chattopadhyay,Esther Duflo

Community based health insurance, rather than market mediated or government provided insurance is an appropriate way of reaching the poor. The development of private health insurance has potential risks and benefits in terms of health care access for the poor and regulatory changes can be used to maximise gains. However, even the private health insurance market lacks development due to the want of regulatory decisions on the supply of health services and the demand for health insurance.||Rajeev Ahuja

In their 'diaries' and 'daybooks' that recount the dissemination of the Book in 'heathen' spaces, the catechists' accounts appear out of tenor with missionary stipulation. These accounts point toward critical considerations not only of evangelical entanglements, but also of enduring enchantments of tradition and community, colony and modernity. Moreover, they proclaim a particular Christianity - historically contingent, distinctly Indian.||Saurabh Dube

Its default reference to the market is hard to unpack. Who should count as education's customer is crucially unclear. If education is an investment in human resources whose beneficiary is the public as a whole, the focus on individual self-interest perceptions becomes too narrow. The public's collective interest is at stake. The state or its advisory bodies cannot learn from linguistics or other rapidly developing fields. Such learning has to be done by active participants in the public debate process. The arena to be reshaped through this debate is the public space itself.||Probal Dasgupta

In this scenario, when the skies were opened to private schedule operators in 1991, it was believed that the consumers would stand to gain from competition. This paper studies the structure of cost in the Indian Airlines with a view to assessing the scope of unlimited competition in domestic civil aviation industry. The findings suggest a high degree of scale economies in the Indian Airlines, limiting the scope of competition. The results on price and substitution elasticities, technical change and productivity growth indicate that better management of the Indian Airlines would be more helpful than the intense competition.||Danish A.

The study finds that farmers rely heavily on pesticides for pest control. However, over-application and indiscriminate use of pesticides has had several adverse consequences and deepened agrarian distress. While accepting the important role of pesticides in India's food security, proper education, adoption of safety norms and integrated pest management practices, and reduction of monocropping should be encouraged to maximise the gains from the use of pesticides.||P.

Using a qualitative approach, the average time spent on housework and agricultural activities by men, women and children and the gendered division of labour are examined. Although Naga society is patriarchal, women enjoy considerable freedom and play an important role in family and community life. Women have a greater range of responsibilities, from domestic work - within and outside the homestead - to various agricultural activities and bear a greater work burden as well. Gender disparity measures reveal that men's responsibility for household activities is shrinking while women's work frontier is expanding, as they take over work traditionally designated as 'male'.||U.

The RBI's proposed stipulations on ownership regulation will have credibility only if the central bank adds another dimension to its supervisory range. It must accept that keeping a watch over the practices and processes of commercial banks is as much a critical component of its supervisory responsibility, as scrutinising the commercial bank's handling of its asset and liability portfolio. The RBI should consider having a separate instrument, a kind of management audit and inspection, as an essential component of its overall inspection. This will add teeth to its surveillance responsibility and keep the RBI abreast of what is happening on the governance front in every commercial bank.||D. N. Ghosh

Karnataka and Andhra, two high profile IT states, have witnessed the ruthlessness with which this force works. This paper presents clues from Karnataka indicating that farmer distress is an outcome not of the lack of agricultural growth but, paradoxically, of the enterprising qualities of farmers who pursue growth and even achieve it in good measure. The indications are that farmers in Karnataka respond quite well to changing markets and are receptive to new technologies. But the drought-prone environment, combined with a non-caring policy regime, turns into victims the very producers who bring about growth.||V. M. Rao,D. V. Gopalappa

It argues that land reform strengthened the patriarchal conjugal framework of property relations in the state, compromising women's independent right to property. While agriculture is no longer considered a viable occupation in the state, greater male occupational mobility has shifted the balance of responsibility for farming and family property increasingly to women. However, this work is being under-reported, is not necessarily 'visible' and comes at the cost of paid employment. For some, social mobility has afforded greater leisure but, along with declining inheritance rights, has led to the rising economic insecurity and vulnerability of women.||Praveena Kodoth

Since history itself has proved to be a dynamic discipline, the habit of viewing films with an eye to 'facticity' should give way to a nuanced understanding of the historical potential of cinema. This paper argues for a new relationship between visual and written history in the interest of both public memory and a socially relevant history. If historians want to bridge the widening chasm between public and academic histories they have no choice but to take relatively new forms of knowledge like film seriously. On the other hand, film-makers cannot, and should not, ignore the context of literacy informing their work. Given the will and ample opportunity to collaborate, historians and film-makers, operating in a heterogeneous field of post-literacy, literacy and pre-literacy, can learn a lot from each other.||Anirudh Deshpande

Its public irrigation systems are performing far below par. As a direct consequence, farmers are turning to groundwater for their irrigation needs. Booming groundwater irrigation has become the mainstay of Indian farming but it has also all but wrecked the country's power economy because of perverse policies of pricing of electricity for agriculture. Yet, there is no firm strategy of dealing with these and other challenges. Other south Asian countries are in much the same boat. Based on two spells of fieldwork in six provinces of north China, this article shows that, facing much the same problems as its south Asian neighbours, China is responding differently to its water problems. This is by no means a suggestion that the approaches China is trying out would work in India - or even in China itself. However, by including China's experience in its discussions, Indian policy-makers will clearly have a wider repertoire of institutional alternatives with which to experiment.||Tushaar Shah,Mark Giordano,Jinxia Wang

With charity for all and malice towards none the historian passes judgment on the deed, rather than the doer. His standard remains consistent, but takes into account that human ideas and ideals are subject to the law of evolutionary growth.

Furthermore, it also advocates the estimation of separate firm level cross section equations for each year to analyse the possible changes in the values of the spillover coefficients over time. The results show the presence of significant spillover effects from FDI. During the initial years of liberalisation, the spillover effects were modest, but increased sharply later on. Firms with better endowments in terms of productivity and technology benefited from liberalisation and MNE presence. Firms with large productivity gaps became victims.||N. S. Siddharthan,K. Lal

The courts do not possess the equipment needed to work out the reorganisation of spaces to minimise, or outlaw, risk.

It finds that monthly deposit flows have been quite stable since the 1991 crisis; nevertheless, there have been occasions when monthly flows turned negative in the short run, coinciding with adverse domestic or external events. Econometric analysis shows that NRI deposits are influenced by standard risk and return variables. In particular, inflows respond positively to changes in relative interest rates on NRI deposits and LIBOR; negatively to political and geopolitical uncertainties, such as the government resigning in midterm or tensions on India's borders; and also to adverse external events, such as the Asian crisis.||James Gordon,Poonam Gupta

For this, at least in part the Reserve Bank must take the blame. Its system of monitoring the banks' performances under various regulations is at best inefficient and at worst biased.

There has been growth in irrigation levels in Telangana, during the past three decades, although the perception that the region suffers from insufficiency of irrigation resources may still be valid. Most of this growth however has come from expansion of well irrigation using private capital, which has adverse implications for groundwater levels and is also contributing to the immiserisation of small and marginal peasants.||Vamsi Vakulabharanam

In the supply of bank credit, the mere availability of liquidity in the system is not enough; credit distribution with defined targets for agriculture, small-scale industries and small borrowers is a necessary condition for expanding effective demand. Second, strong persuasive methods have to be adopted on the structure of deposit and loan rates of banks and their spread. Some calibrated intervention in determining these rates, without excessive micro management, is possible on the part of the monetary authority. Finally, an aspect of the interest rate reform agenda, which has harmed the process of healthy credit delivery, concerns the jettisoning of the system of relatively lower rates of interest for long-term loans as compared with rates for working capital. The principle of asset-liability matching should not prevent the banks and financial institutions from promoting investment credit at concessional rates of interest.||EPW Research Foundation

However, there is great variation in the level of women's empowerment across the different states and across indicators.||Sunita Kishor,Kamla Gupta

The record shows that China has moved cautiously in its privatisation efforts. It has privatised only the smaller state-owned enterprises, and the state retains control over the larger ones. Over a period, China has also pushed through reforms of SOEs, and the empirical evidence is that their performance has improved consequent to such reforms. It could be argued that full-blooded privatisation might have produced even better results. However, given the possible implications in terms of job losses as well as the absence of effective governance mechanisms in China's underdeveloped capital market, its rulers may well have been justified in hastening slowly with privatisation.||T.

China's low but positive real interest rates, facilitated by greater exchange rate volatility, and high infrastructure investment allowed it to outperform India in its first post-reform decade. Political structure did lead to specific inefficiencies in macroeconomic outcomes, but macro-institutional changes exist that can improve policy. More openness under similar labour endowments gives both countries the opportunity to commit to more effective, stable and yet stimulatory macroeconomic institutions and policies.||Ashima Goyal,A. K.

This class and the IT industry to which it belongs are also distinguished by their global integration and relative autonomy from the 'old' Indian economy dominated by the public sector and a nationalist capitalist class.

The very structure of social production that focused on 'man as the breadwinner' has changed to accommodate a substantial and permanent role for women as income-earners. A clue to the far-reaching consequences of this transformation is the manner in which gender norms of respect are being re-created from glorifying 'purdah-nashin' women to valuing independent income, education, work outside the home, mobility and professional engagement. Such changes have in turn, led to substantial alterations in the norms and concepts by which women define their terms of engagement with the world.||Govind Kelkar,Dev Nathan,Rownok Jahan

Reservations at all levels of higher education both redistribute SC and ST students upward in the university quality hierarchy, and attract significant numbers of SC and ST students, who would not otherwise pursue higher education, into universities. That reservations tend to benefit a 'creamy layer' of SC and ST students does not mean they are failing in achieving their objectives. They should be understood, instead, as an effort to promote integration of the upper strata of society - by increasing the access of highly disadvantaged and under-represented communities to elite occupations and decision-making positions.||Thomas E.

The approach of full cost recovery and the imposition of strict financial discipline on state governments by the Reserve Bank of India will result in the further concentration of funds in these areas.||Soumen Bagchi,Soumyadeep Chattopadhyay

With the lack of maintenance and upkeep, rehabilitated tanks soon fall into disrepair, necessitating a new round of externally-induced rehabilitation. Yet, there are many tanks under traditional local management operating at a high level of performance equilibrium. A study of 41 tanks from 22 districts of eight Indian states was taken up under the IWMI-Tata Programme to identify the characteristics of high performing local-managed tank institutions. The lessons learnt from the study can form the basis for an effective institutional protocol that can enhance the effectiveness of tank rehabilitation and modernisation.||R. Sakthivadivel,P.

Pakistan too has hinted at matching Indian plans for putting in place early warning systems. Against this background this study examines the different ingredients that go into the setting up of early warning systems and assesses their effectiveness. Using the insights gained from the study it also draws policy inferences about the viability and advisability of early warning systems in south Asia.||M. V. Ramana,R. Rajaraman,Zia Mian

This discourse, with its primary purpose of seeking to predict which countries are likely to build nuclear weapons and thereby to threaten the prevailing military-strategic status quo, has narrowed the gaze of nuclear historians. Among its effects has been to minimise the importance of the discovery of atomic fission as a 'world historical' event and to impoverish our recognition of the fluidity of international affairs in the decade following the end of the second world war. We are concerned about the tendency to see nuclear histories as, above all, 'national' histories, and, to privilege concerns about the development of nuclear 'weapons' over a fuller and more nuanced understanding of what nuclear programmes mean and why they matter. We propose that paying attention to the scientific-technological underpinnings of nuclear programmes offers an alternative path, opening up new archives and insights into the making of 'national' nuclear programmes which might have important other, even non-belligerent, ends. This article points to the varieties and importance of international collaboration in the making of 'national' programmes, and shows how weapons-building is by no means a universal end of all nuclear programmes.||Itty Abraham

It finds that theoretical positions that affirm this point of view assume that the economy is in full employment, a condition that is not fulfilled in most developing countries. The existence of a definitive positive relationship between real rates of interest and the fiscal deficit-GDP ratio is tested empirically for India and for a number of other countries in the world. The finding is that interest rates do not necessarily depend on the fiscal deficit and that policies based on this understanding are erroneous.||Surajit Das

It has not always been possible to measure the economic impact of AIDS empirically with a reasonable degree of precision. Moreover, while there is some evidence of negative individual, household and firm level impact, the empirical evidence on the impacts at the sector and national levels is still weak. While purely humanitarian considerations may be relevant in supporting investments in HIV/AIDS intervention, they may not always appear to be so for finance ministers and planners in developing countries. To justify spending more on policies to address HIV/AIDS in a regime of tight resource constraints, it is sometimes important to justify investments in AIDS prevention and treatment as being more critical relative to other investments. To the extent that HIV/AIDS has large adverse impacts on economic indicators and other socially desirable goals of society, policy action may be desirable, preferably early in the epidemic, rather than later.||Ajay Mahal

Women domestics are found assuming vital functions and roles in migration, the settling-down process and in the search for job. Women are seen as central in accessing and mobilising social networks, which not only direct the course of migration, but also the survival of the migrant family in the urban milieu. Women, are thus part of the migration systems and subsystems and take up numerous functions. This calls for a re-examination of the validity of some of the widely accepted male-centric analysis in the literature on migration.||N. Neetha

It also studies the effect of micro (individual households) and macro environments (local areas, districts, states) on health behaviour. The study finds strong, independent effects of socio-economic position and social caste, with the better-off smoking, drinking and chewing tobacco less. Significant local area, district and state variations suggest the importance of contexts in shaping health behaviour. It follows that more than individual behavioural change, the direction for policy may well be to focus on changing the macro environments.||S. V.

The period analysis has also been carried out to gauge the impact of liberalisation on the determinants of trade credit.

This right is nowhere near realisation in India, where undernutrition levels are among the lowest in the world. The right to food moreover, does not easily translate into well-defined entitlements and responsibilities. Though serious difficulties are involved in making the right to food fully justiciable, new interventions are possible in at least three ways - through legal action, through democratic practice and through changing public perceptions. More importantly, the right to food needs to be linked to other economic and social rights relating to education, work, health and information, which together hold the promise of radical change in public priorities and democratic politics.||Jean Drèze

Agricultural diversification is strongly influenced by price policy, infrastructure development (especially markets and roads), urbanisation and technological improvements. Rainfed areas have benefited more as a result of agricultural diversification in favour of high value crops by substituting inferior coarse cereals. Agricultural diversification is also contributing to employment opportunities in agriculture and increasing exports. The need is to suitably integrate production and marketing of high value commodities through appropriate institutions. Market reforms in developing and strengthening desired institutions through required legal changes would go a long way in boosting agricultural growth, augmenting income of small farm holders and promoting exports.||P.

The BJP, as the 2003 assembly elections and the 2004 Lok Sabha elections convincingly demonstrated, not only managed to extend its support beyond the traditional upper caste and trading communities, it secured a substantial chunk of the OBC and dalit vote. This was largely due to the pre-existing organisational base of the RSS and other affinities of the Sangh parivar. The Congress, on the other hand, not only succumbed to the anti-incumbency factor; this time its traditional vote base among the dalits and Muslims was in many places divided between the Gondwana Gantantra Party and the BSP.

In this paper, a baseline scenario is generated under some assumptions to ascertain the dimensions of fiscal balance at present, and the likely trends in the medium term. Three sets of alternative policy scenarios are also generated by superimposing alternative assumptions over the baseline scenario to assess and prescribe policy initiatives. It is inferred that lowering the primary deficit, besides a reduction in interest rates, should be an integral part of any policy to make debt sustainable at the state level. An immediate focus of the fiscal reforms should be on achieving revenue balance or, at least reducing its imbalance.||Abha Prasad,Rajan Goyal,Anupam Prakash

These insecurities include high attrition rates, increased stress at work and erosion of worker collectivity. The emergence of a new genre of workers, with distinct features and differently conceived identity, enables the firm to draw and maintain a 'productively docile' workforce within the changed frames of work organisation and human resource management.||Babu P.

The set of papers in this collection attempts to unearth a clearer meaning behind the mandate of elections 2004 from the questions that each pose. Why did these polls not yield a decisive verdict and a simple mandate like elections of the 1970s and 1980s? Moreover, given that the range of possible outcomes was so narrow and the choices before voters limited, why was the NDA unable to hold on to power and why was the final result such a clear verdict against it? A question of more short-term interest to political actors and election strategists is why did such an unpopular government led by the most popular leader of the moment lose the elections. The papers in this collection use the immense body of data generated by the NES 2004 to make an informed intervention in this contested terrain.||Yogendra Yadav

However, discrimination is a complex process taking different forms in different contexts leading to different outcomes. This study, based on the garment manufacturing industry, suggests that in the context of a dynamic industrial activity of a poor labour-surplus economy, discrimination against women can take place outside the labour market. For example, employment depends on education and skills, to which women have unequal access.||Deepita Chakravarty

On the basis of these studies, it is concluded that groundwater markets have a beneficial impact in regions of abundant recharge, such as the GMB basin. Next, two broad strands of methodology used in groundwater market study are compared. Finally, the research gap in the way these markets have been studied are identified.||Aditi Mukherji

Usually, the admission test is designed to measure the applicants' accumulated stock of knowledge through their 12 years of early education. But the data reveal that performance of early education consistently fails to register in the test performance. Is the test design perhaps faulty or is something wrong with the pre-university education system in Bangladesh? Though we have fished a data-driven hypothesis, our analyses provide quantitative support to the observation that we endow a terrible system of early education in the country.||Anu Muhammad,M.

Particularly after 1992, Mexico has implemented serious, comprehensive and far-reaching water sector reforms that required the government to create a new legal framework; restructure existing water administration; promote and support a plurality of new autonomous and quasi-autonomous water institutions; modify incentives in water use to different user groups; and struggle with a vast complex of unresolved operational issues in implementing the reforms. Mexico may not be a model for India but Mexico's experience does suggest that changing the way a nation manages its water resources necessitates far-reaching changes in administration, institutional structure, law and operating rules, incentives and power structures, and above all consistent commitment to the reform process.||Tushaar Shah,Christopher Scott,Stephanie Buechler

These deficits have been sustained largely by the repatriation of savings and export earnings of east Asian economies - the Asian 'tigers'. However, greater regional integration in east and south-east Asia and the growth of consumption is likely to lead to a significant decline in the cash inflows that would fundamentally undermine the material foundations of American dominance. If US actions aggravated the impact of the 1997-98 economic crisis and led to greater cooperation among the Asian 'tiger' economies, this cooperation is now potentially poised to undermine the American eagle.||Ravi Arvind Palat

The theoretical literature suggests that revenue compensation for lost trade revenues be sourced from domestic indirect taxes, and recommends a price-neutral destination-based VAT as the optimal instrument. In a federal setting, this will reduce relative tax collections at national level, where trade tariffs are levied, in favour of the subnational level, with which rights to levy domestic indirect taxes are typically shared. Possible resistance to such a restructuring, and the level from which it could originate will be a function of the history of collection shares in the federation; of the relative shares of discretionary and formulaic transfers from national to subnational level; and of the relative importance of redistributive criteria in formulaic transfers.||Indira Rajaraman

Over the last three decades, a virtually bipolar party system has come to stay in the state, where power has alternated between the Shiromani Akali Dal and the Congress. Looking at the mixed feelings of the Hindus and the Sikhs towards each other, the durability of the alliance between the SAD and the BJP surprises any observer of Punjab politics. The long-standing anti-Congress tradition of SAD, and the complementary electoral bases of the two parties could be the factors behind the sustenance of the alliance. The attempts of the Bahujan Samaj Party to carve out an independent space in Punjab politics have not paid dividends so far. This time, the coming together of Akali factions and the factional disunity in the Congress, coupled with adverse perceptions of the people about the performance of the ruling party seem to have determined the outcome in Punjab.||Ashutosh Kumar

This study attempts to probe this question by analysing growth rates of aggregate and sectoral domestic product of major states in the pre- and post-reform decades. The results indicate that while the growth rate of gross domestic product has improved only marginally in the post-reform decade, regional disparity in state domestic product (SDP) has widened much more drastically. Industrial states are now growing much faster than backward states, and there is no evidence of convergence of growth rates among states. Disturbingly, there is now also an inverse relationship between population growth and SDP growth. This has serious implications for employment and for the political economy of India.||B. B.

It has been the subject of numerous studies that have highlighted the positive effects of EGS on the rural economy of Maharashtra.

Part I of the article examines the concept, design and delivery system of the EGS, so as to assess its effectiveness against poverty and pinpoint its limitations.

Colonial officials characterised it as 'inhumane' and a 'crime'; on the other hand, castes which practised it, usually those higher in the hierarchy, justified it on the grounds that they could not afford the huge dowries or the incalculable marriage expenses having a daughter entailed. British efforts to stop female infanticide or change the social norms that contributed to the practice proved a failure. The failure of the colonial state shows the resilience of institutionalised norms to which female infanticide was related and about which little still remains known.||L. S. Vishwanath

A meeting to commemorate the occasion, speaker after speaker dwelt on the amazing gifts of solidarity and grace which lay behind Chaudhuri's work in the public sphere, most notably the founding of the Economic Weekly (later to become the Economic and Political Weekly). Chaudhuri had an enormous number of friends, many of whom were gifted with sharp minds and sharper pens, but above all, he had sensed that the time was ripe for a long, hard, continuous look at the polity and the economy now emerging from the wretchedness of unfreedom. Everybody present wanted to re-experience the startling birth and growth of the Weekly which did not have the backing of either big money or big clout, but was based on this adventurous man's social capital of friendship and foresight.||Mihir Bhattacharya

However, in most countries, vertically integrated utilities continue to remain better financial performers and are better able to meet customer needs. A review of the act calls for understanding trends in utility reforms; one of which is the concept of distributed generation that is gaining widespread acceptance. Instead of the outright selling of equity in distribution companies, management contracts for operations and maintenance, as seen in some developing countries, should be considered. The development of short-term energy markets is also an area that needs to be examined in detail.||R. Rejikumar

This paper illustrates conditions in brick kilns of Pakistan, drawing attention to the interactions between low wages, debts and insecure shelter in perpetuating bondage for men, women and children, in an otherwise capitalist production system. As in sharecropping agriculture, payment by piece rates in kilns extracts a higher surplus via intensification of labour when low rates compel the use of family labour. Findings are based on rapid assessments at over 100 brick kilns in and around the urban and peri-urban areas of the districts of Hyderabad in Sindh; Multan, Lahore, Rawalpindi in Punjab; and Peshawar and Haripur in NWFP during 2002.||A.

A central question has been ignored by this literature: in a period of marketisation, labour is disempowered on several dimensions: the numerical decline of the organised workforce; weakening trade unions; and, frequently, the politically right-ward turn of social democratic parties which shift to neo-liberal, market oriented policies. This essay provides, in brief outline, a discussion of some important shifts in labour's position in the current era when the economic policy framework has been pulled gradually, but definitively, towards greater measure of integration with markets, both domestic and global. In particular, the focus here is on the shrinking of the organised sector, the world of informal labour, inadequacy of social security nets, and the changing dynamics of trade union functioning.||Supriya RoyChowdhury

By the early 20th century, however, socially mobile lower castes were soon staking their claim to the term. Since independence, vertical changes brought on by increased government spending and other associated economic changes, together with the physical expansion of the city have implied further social change, including a continual change in the meaning of the notion - bhadralok. This paper attempts to map this story of change. Its description of the slow transformation of a Calcutta neighbourhood indicates more significant changes in a mode of living and in the belief systems that marked a bhadralok.||Parimal Ghosh

It is possible, however, to turn the tide by enhancing investment to strengthen the resource base of agriculture, devising suitable instruments to compensate small and marginal producers for losses from natural calamities, designing organisational interventions to impart strength to their economy, lightening the interest burden from non-formal sources of credit, and encouraging rural financial institutions to take over the debts of the farmers from usurious sources.

Economists have long accepted that the market may be a very efficient allocator of resources to maximise output but not an adequate dispenser of social justice. Altogether expectations of a GDP growth rate of 8-9 per cent as has been suggested recently depend very materially on the commodity producing sectors of agriculture and manufacturing industry performing much better than now and in a more consistent fashion. This is, of course, possible; but the chances of achieving such a growth rate require the stepping up of domestic investment rather steeply and an all round increase in factor productivities, together with more employment of labour.

Viewed in the context of women's subordination in third world countries, a redefinition of development must not only be about economic growth, but ensure a redistribution of resources, challenge the gender-based division of labour and also seek to provide for an egalitarian basis in social arrangements.

Data strongly suggest that the 1980s were a predominantly productivity led or 'vertical' growth story, as labour productivity increased steadily during the period. One of the factors that may have led to an increase in labour productivity is the employment of better quality machines by firms, which were imported despite high tariffs.||Ajit Sinha,Shirin Tejani

But though the BJP did not emphasise the 'Hindutva' issue during its campaign, as surveys cited in this article indicate, there is already some 'polarisation' among the electorate, with religion often deciding voter-preference. Moreover, the new 'middle ground' of Indian politics - shaped by commonly-held notions among the populace as to what constitutes a 'nation' and how it should be governed - reveals that sections of the populace are increasingly more 'expressively religious' and also attached to respective group identities. At the same time, this 'middle ground' traverses a very complex terrain and thereby defies any straitjacketing into 'secular' or 'communal'.||Suhas Palshikar

Five services, namely, drinking water, health care, PDS, public transport and primary education are covered by the study. Each service is assessed in terms of four dimensions, viz, access, use, reliability and user satisfaction. State level data are used to compare the performance of different states with reference to these attributes. The paper also examines the experience of poor households and the less developed states with these services.||Samuel Paul,Suresh Balakrishnan,K. Gopakumar,Sita Sekhar,M. Vivekananda

The Congress agenda itself being pro-reform, a vote against reforms should have actually placed the third parties in a position to form the government. This has not been the case.

The analysis comes up with a conclusion that makes intuitive sense: that the distribution segment is the riskiest. The central transmission and generation entities operate under long-term contractual arrangements and have been given the highest form of payment guarantee by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in the form of access to state finances in case of defaults by SEBs, operate under the least risk. The paper attempts to emphasise the determination of return on equity based on a comprehensive risk evaluation matrix for each entity in the value chain and not a uniform return for the entire power sector.||Dhiraj Mathur,Ramanjit Kaur Johal

It presents the basic methodological details so that the quality and limitations of the data can be assessed. The paper also traces the evolution of the tradition of the NES in India and discusses some of its current dilemmas, so as to invite a healthy debate on value and limitations of survey research. To this end, after marking the continuities and changes in a four decade-old tradition and noting the distinctive attributes of the NES 2004, the essay presents the sample frame, the sampling technique and the profile of the sample. It concludes by placing NES 2004 in a comparative perspective and raising some larger questions.||Lokniti Team

Particularly in a democracy, numbers matter and, once the number of poor in a society dwindles to a proportion that can be ignored while forging democratic alliances, political parties are left with no incentive to pursue the cause of the poor. Seen thus, the issue of poverty is a paradox of plural democracy when it is wedded to global capitalism. And the paradox is both political-economic and moral. Presently the trendy slogan of globalisation can be read as the newest effort to paper over that basic contradiction; globalisation has built into it the open admission that removal of poverty is no longer even a central myth of our public agenda.||Ashis Nandy

The ramponkars' agitation is a classic case of a conflict against marginalisation and exploitation of marine resources. The exploitation itself was a collective design wherein the state was aligned with the mechanised trawler owners, and displayed a lackadaisical approach towards the ramponkars' problems. The ramponkars have, after a long battle, succeeded in getting their demands on implementing an exclusion zone for trawlers and on monsoon fishing. However, the recent technological changes adopted by the traditional fisherfolk themselves are unsustainable and will ultimately result in the intensification of the 'tragedy of the commons'.||Sharon D'Cruz,Avinash V.

It analyses the trends in extent, depth and severity of poverty and also malnutrition in rural and urban areas during the last few decades. The incidence of chronic poverty is higher than that of very poor in both rural and urban areas but the former is lower than severe malnutrition. Although the risk of malnutrition decreases with household income (standard of living index), elimination of poverty cannot ensure eradication of malnutrition. The incidence of child malnutrition is particularly high among poor households where mothers have poor nutritional levels, less education and poor access to antenatal care. The lowest incidence of child malnutrition is not in the richest but in the middle income states with progressive social policy. In the 1990s, with faster urban economic growth, urban poverty declined faster, but inter quintile urban inequality and rural-urban inequality worsened. Poverty, chronic poverty and malnutrition, together, got concentrated in a few geographical locations and among specific social groups.||R. Radhakrishna,K. Hanumantha Rao,C. Ravi,B. Sambi Reddy

In other words, while political parties may appeal on the basis of caste mobilisation or an 'anxious' nationalism, such ideological appeals are necessarily limited by their appeal only to sections of the populace. On the other hand, parties are also unable to move beyond the governance agenda or a general politics of redistribution as the state's ability to sustain populism is also limited. Thus, in place of any viable form of electoral mobilisation, parties fight elections via the formation of contingent coalitions. As this article argues, such a politics, while limited, has also strengthened Indian democracy. It has allowed diverse constituencies to share power and also produced political volatility without a corresponding ideological or policy volatility.||Pratap Bhanu Mehta

Food interventions at schools are unlikely to address infant feeding and young child malnutrition as they cater to older children, who in fact suffer from malnutrition since they are young. The solutions to the problem emerge from a clearer distinction between hunger and malnutrition and the knowledge that child malnutrition is directly associated with inappropriate feeding practices. This requires a shift in thinking, from food-based approaches towards feeding behaviour change.||Arun Gupta,Jon E. Rohde

While whether the north-east is landlocked or not may be a matter of perspective and interpretation, the most emphatically undeniable reality is that the seven constituent states of the region are internally locked - themselves locked and locking out others, unable to connect with each other physically in terms of poor transport links, and more seriously, unable to make connections intellectually and emotionally with their closest neighbours, or even with and among their own people.||M.

These disturbing findings are corroborated by strikingly upward trends in the ratios of working capital-to-throughput and gross block-to-throughput over the period.

However, it is doubtful whether these pointers would suffice to mobilise women over the divisions on socio-economic problems, where women across different social groups differ in their opinions. The survey points out that women act as a single unit in certain respects and do not in certain others. Gender reality thus appears to be a layered reality.||Rajeshwari Deshpande

The low natural rate of increase of the tribal population does not suffice to explain this slow growth. In the recent past, substantial tribal outmigration to other states over a long period appears to have been a major cause of this trend. However, as this paper proposes, the gradual drying up of demand for migrant labour, displacement and subsequent disruption of livelihood patterns, inaccessibility to healthcare and other services have placed the tribals at a disadvantage. This is manifest clearly in slower declines (or even increases) in mortality levels among Jharkhand's tribals.||Arup Maharatna,Rasika Chikte

With its increasing acceptance across more villages, the scheme was extended to cover income generation programmes as well as women's self-help groups addressing the village as one social unit for development. At the next stage, the health insurance scheme moved towards action-oriented individuals who could play leadership roles in the community. This empowerment and leadership conferred on select individuals helped initiate the anti-liquor movement in the villages around Sevagram.||Ulhas Jajoo,Anant Bhan

Since courts were unable to provide adequate redressal under general practice because of legal delays, higher litigation cost and complicated legal procedures, the courts introduced public interest litigation. The inferences drawn from the empirical work analysed in the light of the theory of the liability system reveal that the courts are unable to provide incentives to the tortfeasor because of informational disadvantages in the case of scientific knowledge, legal delays, poor monitoring of implementation of orders, etc. There is thus a need to improve the functioning of the liability system by making necessary changes not only in the substance of the law, but also in the working conditions of the courts to protect and improve environmental quality in India.||P.

Whether that is really so, is extremely doubtful. That those classes have reposed trust in the Congress Party under his leadership is clear: the issues of irrigation and employment appear to have contributed to the defeat of the Telugu Desam Party, augmented by the desire for a separate state in the Telangana region. Having realised his debt to the dissatisfaction, the new chief minister has already promised heavy investment in major irrigation projects and free power to farmers.

It also analyses the distribution of big units by industry, state and union territory. It has been demonstrated that the number of big units is small as compared to the total number of units in the country, but that their share in total number of workers is quite substantial, and their share in GDP is likely to be even larger. Accordingly, it has been suggested that the scope of the ASI should be enlarged to cover all such big units in the non-manufacturing sector. This would improve the database for the entire non-agricultural sector, in general, and for national income, in particular.||G. C. Manna,J. P. Bhattacharjee

Banks usually ask for collateral to hedge against defaults. However, we argue that they might not be careful in monitoring the quality of collateral, particularly when they think that the success probability is reasonably high and they will be protected in case of defaults. Limited liability and the definite possibility of a bail out in case of a default can impose severe costs on the regulator who, due to political or social reasons, cannot shift the risk onto the depositors. This is very likely to happen in poor developing countries. We design an incentive mechanism for public sector banks that calls for auditing in the 'good states' of nature. The regulator does not need to regulate when the probability of success is very high or very low. But there is a range of probabilities for which private monitoring by banks falls short of optimal monitoring desired by the regulator. Our scheme helps to implement the desired outcome.||Sugata Marjit,Indrajit Mallick

Curriculum change in the IIMs seems to be based on feasible incremental change rather than on new knowledge, the needs of the students or the demands of an increasingly globalised and interconnected business world.

Despite the entry of small private units into the industry, there is no clear indication of success.

This aspect has been extensively covered for both Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh during the 1990s. The attempt here is to understand the response of political parties to fundamental shifts in the democratic arena in the 1990s in these two states: the decline of the single-dominant party system and the emergence of narrower political formations based on identity which has created a more competitive environment. The differential patterns of mobilisation employed by the BSP and the Congress in the two states using state power from above to put into effect programmes for dalits in order to enlarge their support base among them are examined.||Sudha Pai
17/7/2004-23/7/2004||perspectives||4415283||Economic History: An Endangered Discipline||The dominant paradigm guiding research in economic history held that the market-oriented policies of British colonial rule led India to underdevelopment and poverty. In the past, the idea appealed to economists because it provided independent India's pursuit of socialist policies with an ideological basis. After the return to market in the 1990s, the compatibility between history and policy was undermined leading to progressive irrelevance of history. In order to restore the link between history and economics, we need to replace narratives centred on colonial power with narratives that take structural features, especially resource-endowments, more seriously.||Tirthankar Roy

Tubewell irrigation supports three-quarters of the farming household income in these villages and, strangely, this share is larger for water buyers and farm labourers than for tubewell owners. This is despite the fact that tubewell irrigation costs have soared rapidly with depleting water tables. Despite the high costs and depleting water tables, irrigated areas have increased steadily, making livelihoods even more precariously dependent upon sustainable groundwater management.||M.

Unfortunately, the scholars who identify the right of non-refoulement under Indian law overestimate the amount of legal protection for refugees in India. A sober assessment of Indian law reveals that refugees are not entitled to non-refoulement unless India adopts new legal obligations. Any refugee policies pursued by the government of India should be based on sound analyses of existing domestic law vis-à-vis international standards.||Omar Chaudhary

This paper attempts to assess the impact of ownership and competition on efficiency of firms. To study the effect of ownership, efficiency of some Indian SOEs is compared (to the extent possible) with comparable private sector firms. To study the effect of competition, the efficiency of SOEs operating under a monopoly structure is compared with SOEs operating under a competitive market environment. Results show that, at the enterprise level, there is little empirical justification for a general presumption in favour of either type of ownership. Further, the empirical study results indicate that more than ownership, it is the degree of competition that affects the performance of an enterprise.||Sudhir Naib

This is a wrong reading of the Indian experience for two reasons. First, liberalisation was already under way during the 1980s and it played a crucial role in stimulating growth during that decade. Second, growth in the 1980s was fragile and unsustainable. The more systematic and systemic reforms of the 1990s, discussed in detail, gave rise to more sustainable growth. The paper concludes with a discussion of why the growth rate in India nevertheless continues to trail that of China.||Arvind Panagariya

A lack of reliable information, wide regional and rural-urban differences and a thin research base all make it difficult for policy-makers, administrators and women's health advocates to develop strategic interventions. This article highlights issues that emerged from eight qualitative research studies that formed part of the Abortion Assessment Project - which sought to create an evidence-based body of knowledge on all facets of induced abortion. These studies have thrown up some common patterns and themes, such as the unmet needs for contraception and abortion, the question of son preference, the preference for private providers and the neglected needs of the single, widowed or separated women. More crucially, they highlight the need to integrate diverse viewpoints that would further ease progression towards the common goal of making abortion an infrequently used but safe alternative for women faced with an unwanted pregnancy.||Leela Visaria,Vimala Ramachandran,Bela Ganatra,Shveta Kalyanwala

Yet at the very moment that scholarship seems ready to engage with the Indian city, contemporary globalisation has in fact slowly eroded the old modernist compact of 'the city'. This splintered urbanism has become a significant theatre of elite engagement with claims of globalisation. Using Delhi's media networks as an example this article suggests that new domains of non-legal practices could pose significant problems for classic strategies of incorporation and management in political society. These non-legal domains open up new spaces of disorder and constant conflict in Indian cities that threaten the current self-perceptions of the globalising elite.||Ravi Sundaram

The correlates of employment in the non-farm sector have also been examined. The study is based on rural data from 32,000 households in 1,765 villages across India, collected by the NCAER in 1993-94. Analysis shows that non-farm incomes account for a significant proportion of household income in rural India, with considerable variation across quintiles and across India's major states. Education, wealth, caste, village level agricultural conditions, population densities and other regional effects influence access to non-farm occupations. The direct contribution of the non-farm sector to poverty reduction is possibly quite muted as the poor lack assets, but it has been found that the growth of certain non-farm sub-sectors is strongly associated with higher agricultural wage rates.||Peter Lanjouw,Abusaleh Shariff

The major consequences of globalisation have been: the transmogrification of traditional religions and belief systems; the beginning of the disintegration of the traditional social fabrics and shared norms by consumerism, cyber-culture, newfangled religions and changing work ethics and work rhythms; the fast spreading anomie forcing an ever increasing number of individuals to fall back upon the easily accessible pretentious religious banalities, and attributing to religion the creation and acceleration of extremist, fundamentalist and terrorist tendencies in the third world countries.||P.

The state did record high growth rates of cereal yields during the 1980s, higher than the national figures. However, this promising development could not be sustained in the 1990s, and cereal yields have stagnated since then. Based on fieldwork in eight villages of Bihar, the paper argues that, more than agrarian structure, the lack of adequate infrastructure and economic incentives has contributed to the agrarian stagnation in Bihar. The growth potential unleashed by the expansion of shallow tubewell irrigation has been constrained by (a) complete neglect of public sector investments in physical and institutional infrastructure and (b) unfavourable output to factor price ratios.||Avinash Kishore

Moreover, these elections, like others in the last decade, were also decided largely by the 'Laloo' factor, that is, the degree of support or opposition the RJD leader aroused in his state.

The limited research that exists defines quality either on the basis of drug availability or facility characteristics, but little is known about how provider quality affects the provision of health care. We address this gap through a survey in Delhi with two related components. We evaluate 'competence' (what providers know) through vignettes and practice (what providers do) through direct clinical observation. Overall quality, as measured by the competence necessary to recognise and handle common and dangerous conditions, is quite low albeit with tremendous variation. While there is some correlation with simple observed characteristics, there is still an enormous amount of variation within such categories. Further, even when providers know what to do they often don't do it in practice. This appears to be true in both the public and private sectors but for very different, and systematic, reasons. The study has important policy implications for our understanding of how market failures and failures of regulation in the health sector affect the poor.||Jishnu Das,Jeffrey Hammer

While from a civil rights perspective it is immaterial whether citizens suffer at the hands of the central or state governments, it is important to see this process of centralisation as a tendency that is counterproductive in a polity that sees federalism as a manifestation of democratic decentralisation and a means to preserve political/ideological and cultural plurality.||Ujjwal Kumar Singh

Technically trained people are especially crucial in spreading such awareness because within the existing structures of society, professional credentials largely determine how a person's opinion is perceived and received. Flashing professional credentials is a double-edged sword. The establishment can and does field large numbers of scientists to support their policies. Their prominence is why many people believe in profoundly wrong ideas about nuclear issues at times. Some examples of such mistaken ideas are nuclear weapons preserve peace and nuclear reactors generate cheap electricity. Many of these claims have been disproved by other scientists. But because scientists from powerful institutions like the DAE have much greater access to the media and are sometimes the only scientists that most people ever hear about, anti-establishment scientists face an uphill battle. One way to fight this unequal battle is for scientists to not limit themselves to nuclear weapons issues but also challenge the power of the establishment that manufactures and peddles these weapons in a variety of ways, including on ethical, moral, economic, environmental, and public health grounds.||M.

A more widespread participation of workers with different skill/education profiles, gender, regions, etc, would facilitate deepening of the labour market and eventually reduce costs. This paper hopes to provide a tentative understanding of the processes that have been important for the evolution of the IT labour market in India. It analyses NASSCOM and National Sample Survey (NSS) data to explore the processes that deepen the IT labour market in India. The analysis suggests that deepening is actually taking place, but the pace can probably be enhanced. Transition to the offshore model, growth of the ITES sector, competition and infrastructure-led movement of IT activity to smaller cities, and hiring of workers with diverse education backgrounds and of women workers have facilitated the deepening processes. However, these processes need to be intensified.||Rakesh Basant,Uma Rani

And what are the economic and social policies that could effectively address the problem? The core of the employment problem in India is that of the working poor and addressing this is also the most effective way of eliminating child labour and reducing gender inequality in the world of work. In principle, this can be addressed either by reducing the level of underemployment, increasing the real wage rate for casual labour or facilitating the transfer of poor self-employed persons and casual labourers to regular wage paid jobs. The priority must be to generate a steady process of labour transfer; ensuring that a substantial proportion of the newly created regular wage paid jobs are for low-skilled workers, which points to the need for a growth strategy oriented towards exports of manufactures.||Ajit K.

The system of education that was thus fostered and the preaching of politico-religious groups played a proactive role in shaping Muslim identity as traditional, fundamentalist, exclusivist and even, escapist.||Arjumand Ara
20/11/2004-26/11/2004||special articles||4415808||Indian Manufacturing: Productivity Trends in Pre- and Post-Reform Periods||Contradicting the findings of several earlier studies, recent studies on productivity trends in Indian manufacturing by Unel (2003) and Tata Services (TSL) (2003) have concluded that total factor productivity (TFP) growth in Indian manufacturing accelerated after the 1991 economic reforms. This paper presents an alternative set of estimates of TFP growth in Indian manufacturing in the last two decades, which have largely been made following the methodology of input and output measurement adopted in the studies of Unel and TSL, but avoiding the methodological inadequacies noticed in them. The estimates indicate a slow down in TFP growth in Indian manufacturing in the post-reform period, and thus do not bear out the findings of the studies by Unel and TSL.||Bishwanath Goldar

In an attempt to explain the 'institutionalised systems of riot production (IRS)' that are first created and then activated during periods of political mobilisation or at the time of elections, this article focuses on two riots in Meerut that occurred in post-independence India and were divided by a gap of 20 years. The 1961 riot is posed as a benchmark to contrast with later communal events of 1982, to illustrate the changes - more intense and deadly - that took place in the intervening period and to explain how and why these changes took place.||Paul R.

Concentrating on education sector, this paper reviews some of the well known arguments in favour of, and counter arguments against public subsidies. Since much of the controversies are around subsidies in higher education, the paper focuses on the same, though discussion on lower levels of education is also included. The paper reviews the recent trends in public expenditures on education in India, and the available estimates on the rates of subsidy and cost recovery. Distribution of some specific subsidies in education, such as free education, fee exemptions, textbooks, noon meals, etc, is also briefly analysed. Some of the important issues on, for example, the size of the subsidy, targeting versus universalism, and methods of cost recovery are also briefly discussed. It has been shown that the level of subsidies in education in India is not particularly high, nor is the rate of cost recovery particularly low, in comparison with other developed and developing countries. It has also been found that some of the specific subsidies in education are fairly progressively distributed.||Jandhyala B. G. Tilak

There is little doubt that enrolment and retention of children, including girl children, in schools have shown significant improvement. Besides, drop-out rates have shown a decline. However, as this paper analyses, there is now a need to seriously re-examine the orginal rationale for the scheme, namely, getting children to school and retaining them. In the two decades of the scheme's existence, the educational profile as well as the nature of problems at the ground level have changed significantly. Much of this is not reflected in the data presented and available with the government. On the other hand, the scheme has not been able to bring all children to school. If the midday meal is to retain its effectiveness and relevance, it may have to be modified in the light to these changes.||Padmini Swaminathan,J. Jeyaranjan,R. Sreenivasan,K. Jayashree

This paper critically examines the assumptions behind and the main justifications extended for the project. The paper disagrees with the concept that river basins can be mechanically divided as 'surplus' or 'deficit' ones, and views the proposed interlinking as an extremely cost-ineffective measure for the expansion of a rather inefficient traditional irrigation process. Thus, in the event of the mega-project being taken up as it is, it will lead to sub-optimal use of the water resources of the country through a huge and unwise investment. The official justifications for the proposed interlinking of rivers are not found to be backed by any scientific reasoning.||Jayanta Bandyopadhyay,Shama Perveen

If water quality improves and consumers believe they are better off in some way, then there will be willingness to pay money for securing this improvement. This willingness to pay (WTP) reflects economic valuation of improved water quality. Spending power of households and educational background are important determining factors in WTP. Any sustainable water management policy decision through imposition of water charge needs to take income distribution pattern and ability to pay across expenditure classes into consideration.||Joyashree Roy,Subhorup Chattopadhyay,Sabyasachi Mukherjee,Manikarnika Kanjilal,Sreejata Samajpati,Sanghamitra Roy

II: Gender Concerns and Issues for Restructuring||The Employment Guarantee Scheme (EGS) initiated in Maharashtra in the early 1970s is the oldest and the largest public works programme in the developing world. It has been the subject of numerous studies that have highlighted the positive effects of EGS on the rural economy of Maharashtra. Yet none of these has furnished concrete evidence for most of these inferred effects. Moreover, there have been no investigations since the 1990s, when both the rural economy of Maharashtra and the EGS have undergone significant changes in size, character and direction. This article reviews the EGS to assess whether it requires restructuring for poverty alleviation and gender equality. Part I of the article (which appeared in the issue of April 17, 2004) examined the concept, design and delivery system of the EGS, so as to assess its effectiveness against poverty and pinpoint its limitations.

But earlier elections, as surveys too bear out, were contested on the BJP's ability to create a false polarisation among the electorate on the Hindutva issue. In that sense, the 2004 elections were almost 'normal' - as the Congress fought a campaign highlighting issues of governance and the state government's failure to deliver on the development front.

Thanks to the market access and production enhancement programmes run by cooperatives, dairying has emerged at the centre stage of rural livelihoods systems in arid and semi-arid regions. However, intensification of dairying has been accompanied by intensive use of water used in growing feed and fodder. This study estimates that dairying-based rural livelihoods systems are now threatening the limited water resources of arid and semi-arid areas, and their future in turn is threatened by the depletion of these resources. The paper analyses virtual water exports and imports by some of the leading dairy cooperatives of Gujarat.||O. P. Singh,Amrita Sharma,Rahul Singh,Tushaar Shah

It explores the reasons for the wide gaps in the measure of fiscal deficit and the estimate of aggregate subsidy, and suggests an improvement in methodology for the latter, using the example of Maharashtra to tally the aggregate unrecovered costs. The paper shows that the subsidy estimated as unrecovered costs of the present consumption programme should not exceed the budgetary fiscal deficit.||Mukesh Anand,Raghbendra Jha

Evidence from Indian States||This paper explores the role played by infrastructure in determining the level of economic development across the states over different time spans during the past quarter century. A comparative static framework is developed in order to test the movement of the development trajectory of the states in the infrastructure-income plane. The findings of the paper are statistically significant and have serious implications for future regional policies. It shows that interstate disparities in physical, social and economic infrastructure facilities have remained at an alarmingly high level. There are also indications that interstate differences in infrastructure are responsible for a growing regional income disparities.||Buddhadeb Ghosh,Prabir De

Different approaches to how energy poverty might be measured are presented. One approach involves the estimation of basic energy needs of a household based on engineering calculations and certain normative assumptions. The second looks at poverty in relation to access to different energy sources. An alternative approach is then provided that combines the elements of access and consumption of energy in order to examine how these relate to the well-being of households. Examining well-being in terms of both these dimensions - access to clean and efficient energy sources and sufficiency in terms of the quantity of energy consumed could be an important complementary measure of poverty. The consumption dimension includes non-commercial consumption and thus includes self-produced and bartered products. The access dimension can serve as an indicator of the extent of market integration, or more specifically, as an indicator of the opportunity of households to join the modern market economy.||Shonali Pachauri,Daniel Spreng

Social stability is about the condition of freedom from social disorder generally manifested in the form of inter-group conflict or violence. It is also the condition of sustainable development and well-being. In India, with the UPA government ushering in yet another era of coalition politics following the five-year rule of the NDA, the issue of stability is now being more widely debated. This article asks whether an alliance regime with diverse ideological forces and power claimants can creditably achieve the goal of overall stability. Much will depend on how best the partners in the coalition government are able to remain cohesive and look at the question of stability from a perspective that ensures social development, freedom and harmony.||Chandan Sengupta

An acreage response function for the period 1950-51 to 1996-97 corroborates the results of earlier scholars, which is that India's aggregate supply function is not price responsive. However, periodising the framework of analysis, due to changed growth rates and policies after 1980-81 suggests a weak relationship between acreage response and terms of trade for the latter period. For this period, acreage response to prices in the market determined non-foodgrains sector, on the other hand, is highly significant. It is still incorrect to say that Indian agriculture responds at the aggregate level to price stimuli but ignoring the marketisation of substantial sections of the economy is also not useful. The agrarian economy reflects the transitional nature of the policy regime since 1980 and this paper offers some tools to understand it.||Munish Alagh

This paper explores the dilemmas created by the 'different sequentiality' by focusing on one revealing moment - the 1951 Act that first amended the Constitution, interpreted here as a landmark in the story of modenity in India. While the amendment was seen to limit individual rights it reflected primarily the imperatives of the modernising project envisaged by India's anti-imperialist elite that included the creation of a bourgeois democracy, the capitalist transformation of the economy and the establishment of social justice.||Nivedita Menon

This paper, however, seeks to understand a relationship of a different order, that between caste and crime which in colonial India came to be linked in socially significant ways. Administrative discourse in colonial India sought to classify castes lower in the hierarchy and aboriginal tribes as criminal tribes and castes. Colonial administrative and metropolitan ideas and practices were thus used to classify certain groups as 'criminal'. Even as the state specified due requirements in the classification of such groups, these were prompted by broader imperatives - the consolidation of the colonial administrative edifice.||Mukul Kumar

By taking advantage of the laws, the farmers can get conferred ownership or occupancy rights on the tenanted lands under their control, cause hardship to petty lessors (landlords), displace petty peasants from the lease market and expose poor tenants to a process of self-exploitation by vying with them for land in the lease market. Large farmers may contribute to capitalist development in agriculture. But development of capitalist relations may lead to proletarianisation of large sections of the rural working classes. There is a need to rid the large farmer of the lease market in the interest of the petty peasant. It seems important to make tenancy laws sufficiently stringent to restrict entry into the lease market only to petty peasants.||C. S. Murty

Export of frozen fish recorded the highest annual growth but shrimps and prawns constituted the major category of exports, capturing an impressive 5 per cent of the world export market. Trade reforms of the 1990s seem to have further facilitated the export of fish and fish products from India and the feared import surge after the opening up of the economy is still not visible. Measures of relative competitive advantage reveal that India has become reasonably competitive in recent years but it must vigorously take up various sanitary and phyto-sanitary measures, consistent with WTO guidelines, in order to give exports a further boost. However, there is a concern that these measures are being increasingly promulgated with the deliberate purpose of shielding domestic producers from international competition.||Anjani Kumar

Technical efficiency of firms, estimated with help of a stochastic frontier production function, is considered for the analysis. A comparison of technical efficiency is made among three groups of firms in Indian engineering: (i) firms with foreign ownership, (ii) domestically owned private sector firms, and (iii) public sector firms. The results clearly indicate that foreign firms in Indian engineering industry have higher technical efficiency than domestically owned firms. No significant difference in technical efficiency is found between private sector and public sector firms among the domestically owned firms. There are indications of a process of efficiency convergence - the domestically owned firms tending to catch up with foreign owned firms in terms of technical efficiency.||B. Goldar,V. S.

This paper examines the relevance and applicability of the Canadian system of inter-governmental transfers in the Indian case. Equalisation grants are meant to ensure that provinces have sufficient revenues to provide reasonably comparable levels of services at reasonably comparable levels of taxation. An elaborate 'representative tax system' approach using individual revenue bases is used in Canada for determining the equalisation grants, although there has recently been a debate to use a more macro approach. The source-by-source approach is less practical in the Indian case for want of comparable and reliable information required for applying the method. A more practical alternative is the macro approach, which is adopted in India, but better indicators of fiscal capacity than those based on GSDP need to be used. In addition, the concept of ensuring that resources are available for maintaining the per capita expenditure of select basic services at certain levels among states, as attempted in Canada through the CHST transfers, is worth exploring.||C.

As compared to work-family research in Europe and the US that has evolved in to a distinct sub-area of cross-disciplinary study, in India it has followed two separate and disconnected paths. One is the route charted out by women's studies centres with a focus on underprivileged women that looks at structures of patriarchy and their contribution to subordination of women at work and home. The other path of psychosocial research conducted largely from a role theory perspective, has examined work family relations within urban settings.

The GST has served to increase the vertical imbalance in the system, which was high even prior to this change, by placing more revenue resources with the Commonwealth Government in Australia. In spite of a high degree of expenditure centralisation, considerable emphasis is placed in Australia on achieving horizontal fiscal equalisation through an elaborate mechanism of equalisation transfers, which looks into both revenue and expenditure sides of the state budgets and calculates revenue and expenditure 'disabilities' that account for departures from a pure equal per capita distribution of the shareable amounts. This paper looks at the equity and efficiency implications of the Australian equalisation transfers and considers its relevance for the Indian system, which has many comparable features. Apart from the need for making equalising features of the Indian transfer system more transparent, there is need for emphasising some cost disabilities, particularly those that are structural and exogenous in nature.||C.

Surveys since the project was introduced have indicated an increase in the average period of food self-sufficiency in every involved household.

Its primary aim was to give fair rates for tribals. However, delays in the declaration of rates and the refusal of procurement centres to purchase certain products force tribals to sell to private traders, who often cheat them by using fake weights. The role of multiple agencies in implementing the scheme should be avoided and responsibility should be fixed on only one agency to make it more efficient.||Kailas C. Thaware

The assertion of Indian identity, expression of cultural nationalism or feeling of emotional commonality - these are no longer confined to the stadium or post-match activities. Rather, they have become synonymous with a new games ethic eloquently exemplified through the redefined everyday culture of cricket hardly discernible in European nations.||Boria Majumdar,Kausik Bandopadhyay

The defeat of the TDP government has been interpreted as a 'vote against anti-people reforms'. The discourse analysis of the election campaigns of different parties however, clearly shows that except for the Left no mainstream party made this election a contest on reforms. The crisis-centric discourse of the Congress displayed possibilities for new discursive coalitions and political alliances, as concerns of marginalised groups gained prominence.||K. Srinivasulu

Different policies and programmes will be required to deal with each of these two separate trends and both will be needed simultaneously in all villages. The most effective public policies to apply in any region are best identified through careful micro-level analyses. A methodology to assist with this kind of inquiry was developed initially for investigations in southern Rajasthan and was modified in northern Gujarat. This paper reports the results of investigations using the improved methodology in 36 villages of Andhra Pradesh.||Anirudh Krishna,Mahesh Kapila,Sharad Pathak,Mahendra Porwal,Kiranpal Singh,Virpal Singh

This paper discusses the practicality of nuclear civil defence in south Asia. It first outlines the nuclear weapons effects from which India and Pakistan must seek to protect their citizens. It then describes briefly how other nuclear weapons states have approached tasks such as protection of their citizens against blast, fire and fall-out, and possible evacuation of populations from cities, as well as alerting and educating the public to nuclear danger. The authors then assess the challenges that India and Pakistan would confront if they seek to implement such measures. Finally, with these constraints in mind, the paper offers simple proposals for civil defence measures that might mitigate in some small way the great damage that would follow from nuclear weapons use in the subcontinent.||R.

It is obvious from the study that West Bengal has taken little initiative to promote true gender equality or to remove the barriers that prevent women from availing of public facilities offered by the state. Expenditure on education has not been sensitive to the special needs of girls. West Bengal's budgetary expenditure compared with its NSDP is lower than other major states. The government has not done much to improve its own resource position, complaining instead that it has been denied its due share in central revenues - a claim that does not stand up to scrutiny.||Nirmala Banerjee,Poulomi Roy

Systematic studies focused on the capital account have not been forthcoming and the current study is an attempt in this direction. A moderate sized simultaneous equation model, encompassing major constituents of the capital account, as well as other macroeconomic sectors, is estimated using annual data over the period 1970-71 to 1998-99. The model is then used to conduct several contrafactual simulations, embracing alternative scenarios. The two major factors impinging on the Indian capital account are changes in world income and in non-interest domestic government expenditure. Monetary measures such as CRR or bank rate changes seem to have limited implications for the capital account as does a proactive policy of real exchange-rate targeting.||Rajiv Ranjan,D. M. Nachane

It is clear that the formula 'democracy at home, despotism abroad' is perfectly applicable today in the context of realist discourses of national interest, that the liberal evangelical creed of taking democracy and human rights to backward cultures is still a potent ideological drive, and that even the instrumental use of ideological rhetoric for realist imperialist ends remains entirely available, as seen in the case of Iraq.

These are puzzling outcomes because the poor in India, who vote in large numbers, would benefit most from more of the latter and less of the former. This paper argues that inadequate social services and excessive targeted transfers can be explained as a consequence of the incomplete information of voters, lack of credibility of political promises, and social polarisation.||Philip Keefer,Stuti Khemani

The sample includes 89 villages and covers four successive panchayat administrations. While average levels of poverty alleviation efforts were high, there were significant variations both across and within villages over time. Poverty alleviation efforts within villages improved when land was distributed more equally, the poor became more literate, there were fewer low caste households and local elections were more contested.||Pranab Bardhan,Dilip Mookherjee

The analysis indicates that wheat production is concentrated and growth is driven predominantly by yield increases, and to some extent by a shift in area from other crops. Future growth is likely to be constrained on both these counts. Also, a demand gap may emerge in the future depending on income and population growth, posing a challenge to India's agriculture, food security and economy.||Vasant P.

It would simply deprive them of considerable employment opportunities as also the possibility of improving employment conditions through global solidarity and coordination. A much more sensible objective would be concerted action to shape the global order in accordance with a women's agenda. This would in the first instance mean working for an extension of the reach of international law, and for democratic institutions of global governance.

30/10/2004-05/11/2004||review of women studies||4415738||Sieving Budgets for Gender||Gender budgeting exercises attempt to assess how far prevailing gender-based biases are incorporated into budgetary exercises. Such analyses also provide women with vital information regarding the contents and focus of existing government policies. The aim is to promote greater transparency and enhance democracy. After the late 1990s, when gender budgeting exercises were first set in motion, such exercises have quickly come into vogue and many scholars have undertaken them. This period has also been marked by shifts in economic policies, especially in developing countries. Reforms in the name of development that have had a pernicious effect on women have been implemented. Recent studies in India have looked at the many well-intentioned public schemes that have failed to achieve significant results. The set of papers included in this review illustrates the progress made so far. While there is still need for crucial interaction between analysis and the structures of gender that currently exist in society as well as with the elements necessary for transforming gender relations, these efforts, as presented here, are a step towards opening a meaningful dialogue with policy-makers to make them appreciate exactly what it is that women want and in what form.||Nirmala Banerjee,Maithreyi Krishnaraj

This growth in non-monetary liabilities has tended to finance bank credit. The RBI's non-monetary liabilities have shown extraordinary increases due to sterilisation measures but the corresponding numbers for the banking system are much larger. Primarily, the banks are financing assets based on various forms of non-monetary liabilities. To an extent this is explained by the transformation of IDBI into a commercial bank. But a good part of the increase took place before IDBI became a commercial bank. It is likely that sizeable amounts of float money are emerging as a source for banks to expand commercial lending.||EPW Research Foundation

If the responsibility for ensuring growth and stability of global economy has to be shared by all, the configuration of power structure that dominates the global decision-making bodies has to change fundamentally.

While inadequate infrastructure and the lack of teachers affect the quality of teaching, poverty is responsible for the alarming rates of non-enrolment, dropouts and poor attendance of pupils. Scheduled tribe children are particularly at a disadvantage as education is not imparted in their mother tongue. The state of primary education, as this paper suggests, needs a multi-pronged effort to ensure its greater effectiveness.

Using trade and tariff data mostly from the DGCIS, this paper estimates these for a selected number of commodity groups for years 1993-94 to 1997-98. For the case of constant price elasticity of import demand, a formula for the deadweight loss is derived, which requires information on the magnitude of the elasticity, the tariff rate and total expenditure on imports, not on the import volume. It is shown that in some sectors, the welfare losses have remained persistently high, e g, iron and steel, and, in others, it has come down substantially, e g, machinery. At the absolute level, however, the losses remain high at least in some sectors.||Satya P. Das

The Indian government's inability to ensure justice to the Bhopal victims, however, appears in stark contrast to the war against terror waged by the US government, ostensibly to ensure a world safe for its citizens, even as it remains oblivious to the rights of other citizens and other sovereign nations.

A major hydrological opportunity for rejuvenation of the aquifer system is provided by the availability of unutilised flows from Narmada basin. It is proposed to divert this water to north Gujarat through the Narmada main canal, and use the existing canal networks and village ponds and tanks in the region to activate a decentralised recharge process. This paper examines its physical and economic feasibility. An evaluation of two recharge scenarios in north Gujarat shows that using pumped water for recharging outside the designated command area may prove to be an uneconomical proposition, unless there is substantial increase in the productivity of water. Recharge within the command would be much more economical.||Rahul Ranade,M. Dinesh Kumar

Some of the major concerns of developing country and LDC members seem to have been taken on board, even though many others are yet to be addressed.

This political context, defined by the contestation of legitimacy of mainstream politics on the one hand and the situation of armed militancy and separatism on the other had constricted the very nature of democratic politics. The relevance of the NC today extends beyond competitive regional politics. Its claim as the initiator of the tradition of the political movement in Kashmir and its contribution to the evolution of Kashmiri identity politics, assume importance in the contemporary situation of the state.||Rekha Chowdhary,V.

ITI's experience shows that the government's market-oriented reform programme ended up creating anything but a level-playing field for public enterprises. On the one hand, by eliminating its monopoly privileges but not the constraints flowing from state ownership, and on the other hand, by imposing new market-related constraints, deregulation had an extremely destabilising effect on the operations of ITI.||Dilip Subramanian

Despite the continued threat of militancy and the politics of separatism running a course parallel to electoral politics, the improved showing of the People's Democratic Party in the Kashmir Valley and the resurgence of the Congress in Jammu establishes two things. First, that issues relating to a Kashmiri identity have now found a space in the electoral agenda beyond an exclusive, separatist platform and, second, the politics of division in Jammu, either of religion, caste or tribe, as encouraged by the BJP and the National Conference, has been firmly rejected. It remains to be seen whether the centre, in an atmosphere of renewed optimism in the electoral process as several election surveys also revealed, will now attempt to seek some resolution of the long-standing Kashmir issue by involving more groups in the process.||Rekha Chowdhary,V.

Several channels are used for these transfers: the Finance Commission, the Planning Commission, and central government ministries. This article uses panel data on centre-state transfers to examine how the economic and political importance of states influences the level and composition of per capita transfers, as well as differences in temporal patterns of Planning Commission and Finance Commission transfers. We find evidence that states with indications of greater bargaining power seem to receive larger per capita transfers, and that there is greater temporal variation in Planning Commission transfers.||Nirvikar Singh,Garima Vasishtha

'Soft voters' of the Congress seemed to have moved more towards the NDA rather than the LDF. This is a new trend in the electoral politics of Kerala, where bipolarism is already on the decline.||G.

The project was to blaze a new trail in farmer-participatory irrigation project design and management with water user associations building their own distribution systems. However, as it unfolds, the institutional reality of the project is vastly different from its plans. If SSP is to chart a different course from scores of earlier large irrigation projects, it must invent and put into place new rules of the irrigation management game.||Jayesh Talati,Tushaar Shah
