More than the idiosyncratic behaviour of those involved, or the fallouts of warring factions within the Sangh parivar, the greater danger is the continuing loss of autonomy, accountability and creativity within the wider research community. We need to realise that the ICSSR system today plays a marginal role in the world of ideas and use the opportunity of a pluralised donor market to re-invent our ways of working and organising ourselves, including forcing the government to re-examine the basic memorandum of understanding it has with the ICSSR. This, more than concern about the fate of M L Sondhi, remains the real challenge.||Harsh Sethi

These remained localised and did not result in the large-scale devastation that had marked the riots of 1992-93. However, their occurrence should serve as a continual reminder that very often, innocuous incidents like a property dispute can easily take on communal colour; communal divides too can be easily stirred up by vested interests. More unfortunate has been the response of the civil authorities - who have either been accused of sheltering miscreants or else their response has been seen as belated and reactive.||Asghar Ali Engineer

We find that, by and large, productivity gains achieved by APSRTC are being passed through to customers. However, the data reveal a significant change in the pattern during the 1990s, particularly from 1995-96 onwards. During this period, on average the productivity of APSRTC declined, whereas its input factor prices compared with output prices increased significantly. This has resulted in a deterioration of its financial condition.||Sanjay Kumar Singh

In all social forms, humans have created institutions to restrict individual access to resources so that they may be preserved for collective benefit. Tragedies of the commons occur when such collective institutions are undermined and individuals lose the sense that their long-term interests in resource preservation are being assured. The case of Gujarat's fishery presents one such instance where development overlooked local institutions that may have been able to restrict resource over-exploitation by fishers.||Derek Johnson

Their role continued to be significant as long as technology remained labour-intensive and collieries were small and surface-bound. The expansion of the industry and increasing mechanisation saw a decline in women's participation.

The search for a sea route was not merely to seek alternative trade routes to the 'Spice lands'; it was also an exercise, sponsored by the church and royalty to win Christian allies in the hitherto unexplored world for the battle against Islam. Vasco da Gama was followed by several other Europeans - yet the diversity and the rich complexity they encountered gave rise to varying perceptions. It was the Portuguese who first labelled the native inhabitants - the 'gentoos' or 'gentios' - a term that was used as late as 1774 by the British, to denote this time, the religion of the natives.||Sushil Srivastava

But CBA is even more specific as an ideology. Proponents of the CBA approach insist that this tool can be used to evaluate alternatives in complex decision situations from the point of view of resource allocation. The CBA ideology is precise and ambitious with the promise of delivering what is best or an 'optimal' solution for society as a whole. These strong claims by advocates of CBA is at the heart of many of the disputes concerning decision-making in areas such as energy systems, dam construction and road planning. CBA exemplifies a tradition in science generally where only that which can be expressed in quantitative terms counts and where the scientist or analyst should be able to point out the 'best' alternative. Such a role for science and for the tools offered does not appear to go well with dominant ideas of democracy.||Peter Soderbaum

Feminist philosophers have shown that the study of the meaning of human life cannot be done without a feminist worldview. Although high brow philosophical theory is a small, indeed elitist, field it is enormously influential in the long run, with lasting effects on the shape of everyday life. It is important that women infiltrate the field of 'high brow' theory and research. Feminism should not only concern itself with fair play/equality but also with changing the rules of the game. Not only politics, economics and science, but philosophy is very important in making and changing the rules. This paper examines feminist philosophy as a process that has influenced the worldview on women and is significant for a continued emancipation process in development cooperation.||Riet Turksma

State operations further perpetuate the connections between caste and class. Thus land reforms ostensibly designed to benefit the disadvantaged are subverted by vested interests who dominate the state's politics and administration. Any attempt on the part of the underclass to politically mobilise has been met by brutal state repression by dominant caste militias. The all-pervasive gender bias that allows the exploitation of women, and the raging illiteracy that afflicts the underclass accentuates this oppression.||Anand Chakravarti

A measure of economic sovereignty and decentralisation has now placed the onus on state chief ministers to effect economic growth in their respective states. Not only do they need to negotiate a path that avoids undue capitulation to populist pressures; to invite private investment, they must work in consonance with the centre's new role as a regulator and fiscal disciplinarian and deal with the hard-budget constraints demanded by the faceless, international credit-rating agencies.||Lloyd I.

Reorienting water resources research in the current changed context of declining foreign aid and increasing social and environmental activism means dealing less with issues of technology per se and more with adoption and adaptation of technology, which becomes more of a social or institutional issue. This essay tries to examine water rights conflicts in two connected geographical locales of south Asia: Bihar and Nepal. Because both areas are part of the Ganga basin, the future of Nepal and Bihar are inextricably linked as far as development, in particular of water resources is concerned. The challenges of water management in the Himalaya-Ganga in the decades ahead will depend, to a large extent, on the kind of statesmanship available to balance all three institutional solidarities - regulatory bureaucracy, innovative market and cautionary activism. The alternative is conflict where no one gets anything except lawsuits, demonstrations, delays, intractable disputes, and even violence.||Dipak Gyawali

In the cost-benefit world, all values belong to a single sphere and can be compared on a seamless scale so that socio-economic choices can be made - the thesis of commensuration. In contrast, anthropological comparison suggests that people do not always commensurate in everyday life, and employ other tools for making social selections. This paper focusing on the assumptions and the economic world that cost-benefit analysis invokes, begins with an anthropological model of the economy and some problematics of the cost-benefit procedure, using some ethnographic tales to illustrate the problems and closes with suggestions for ways cost-benefit analysis might be used.||Stephen Gudeman

Ground reality is more complex, as the fieldwork on which this paper is based shows.

A common trend in most of the discussions is to proceed from projections of demand to supply-side solutions in the form of 'water resource development' projects; estimate the massive investment funds needed; take note of the severe limitations on the availability of financial resources with governments; point to private sector investment as the answer; and stress the need for policy change to facilitate this. In India, consciousness of the importance of the subject led to the appointment of the first National Commission on water, which submitted its report in September 1999. This paper attempts to provide a broad and compendious account of the state of affairs in India as far as water resources are concerned and to chart a course for the future.

The apparently uniform and narrow theological convictions prevalent in a number of countries is really a product of the neo-imperialist attempt to control the fate of Islamic societies by specific acts of patronage and financial sponsorship. Escape from neo-imperialism is thus the first step, before socio-economic changes create the basis of new possibilities.||Gautam Sen

There is thus a significant spillover of government expenditure into the current fiscal year manifesting in four key developments - unusually high ways and means advances from the RBI, more rapid completion of the government's borrowing programmes so far this year, a 60 per cent rise in RBI's net credit to the government and finally, dwindling tax revenues, galloping expenditures and rising fiscal deficit.||EPW Research Foundation

Buddhadev Bhattacharya alluded to this in the run-up to the elections.

Gandhi's visit kindled the process of giving the freedom movement in Uttarakhand a mass base. Just so, the numerous social activists of the Chipko movement and the anti-liquor protests of today owe their inspiration of Gandhi. In many ways, Gandhi's understanding and analysis of the issues, including untouchability, the flesh trade and the education system, and the prescriptions he suggested for their remedy form a useful basis for a blueprint to solve the region's problems even today.||P.

However, the focus has mainly been to promote IT as a foreign exchange earner. This paper looks at India's performance in software exports, the implications of this boom on the availability of skilled manpower in other competing sectors, and the possible threats to the sustained growth of software exports. To combat some of the negative offshoots of the current export-centric IT scenario, the authors say a proper incentive structure needs to be looked at, and the supply of technically skilled personnel enhanced. Most important of all, the diffusion of IT into other areas of the economy should be accelerated to help in the sustained growth of the sector.||K. J. Joseph,K. N. Harilal

The speediest way out of this imbroglio may well be to treat DPC as a stranded project and negotiate the lowest cost to move the foreign investors out of the project. This may mean that governments might have to take a knock because of stranded costs, to the extent that the price payable might be more than what an Indian investor might be willing to pay. Tariffs can then be based on those lower capital costs and without the dollar denominations.||S. L. Rao

This has shifted the impetus to the growth of bank deposit with no improvement however in household savings. The severe liquidity strain in the industrial sector has prompted the postponement of investment decisions by entrepreneurs.

Through a look at his various experiments, many unrealised in his time, it is shown that Gandhi's life defined a space for an alternative science for civil society that would operate with different methods. Gandhi's focus on the non-physical resources in organising for science, the satyagrahi scientist, for instance, is a radical departure from science policy as expressed by Nehru in his famous Scientific Policy Resolution of 1956 and followed in India since independence. He also had a universal message by providing a new cosmology of man-nature and fact-value relations that he articulated and put in place through his various experiments. With this outline of a theoretical framework for Gandhian science, the case of the khadi movement is taken up for detailed explication.||Shambhu Prasad

The aggregates are constructed over weakly separable groups obtained from a non-parametric test of separability considering four assets, viz, (i) currency with the public, (ii) net demand deposits with the banks, (iii) net time deposits with the banks and (iv) post office savings deposits. The analysis covers two different samples - one annual (1970-1996) and the other monthly (1985:04-1996:09). The comparative performance of the divisia aggregates in relation to the simple sum aggregates is evaluated with the help of three tests, viz, money demand stability, information content and Davidson-Mackinnon J-tests. The results of the study show that the Divisia aggregates have an edge over their simple sum counterparts. Further, the results of an extended analysis covering a new asset, viz, the certificate of deposit, also exhibit a similar trend for the monthly sample period: 1994:06-1996:07.||Debashis Acharya,Bandi Kamaiah

Viewing mental illness from the biomedical perspective, mainstream academic approaches have, by and large, ignored the impact of socio-cultural factors. In an area such as women's mental health, it is necessary to consider the socio-cultural context of their health since it is being increasingly recognised that the stresses that differentially affect women because of their unequal social status have led to pervasive mental health problems. The present paper focuses on the gender-specific distribution of psychological disorders and construction of a socio-demographic profile of women affected by mental illness. Data from hospital case records of patients in two major psychiatric facilities in the city of Visakhapatnam formed the empirical basis for the study.||U. Vindhya,A. Kiranmayi,V. Vijayalakshmi

In India, consciousness of the importance of the subject led to the appointment of the first National Commission on water, which submitted its report in September 1999.

But it is important that quick fixes be avoided if long-term development is not to be compromised. The main reasons for the current slowdown are structural and must be addressed as such. This calls for boosting not any kind of government expenditures, but expenditures that will raise productivity. Alongside must be tackled the institutional impediments that continue to obstruct private investment.

The basic function of financial institutions and banks and the financial/capital markets is to facilitate the transfer of funds from the surplus to the deficit pockets. The main thrust of policy now should be to create seamless linkages between DFIs/banks and capital markets to facilitate this process of transfer from the ultimate savers to the ultimate users at minimum cost. Such a policy should also ensure a neutral stance towards banks and the capital markets thus making for an environment where there is efficient resource allocation as well as a certain discipline among users of funds.||R.

Besides, the recent slowdown in the US has lowered growth estimates for the infotech industry. The Indian software industry cannot afford to be complacent if it wants to maintain its position as a premier purveyor of software services. The industry will need to consolidate its strengths and move up the value chain if it is to maintain its head start on the competition.

This paper argues that how we value is an important social and political relationship. Drawing on examples taken from art, federal water projects, and people's efforts to resist them, the author describes some of assumptions behind, and the consequences of, people's efforts to capture or convey value through processes of commensuration: the transforming of qualitative relations into a common metric. The effects of commensuration are complex and variable; as a strategy of valuing, commensuration can create new objects and new relationships between objects; it can systematically exclude certain kinds of valued goods, relations, or people. Commensuration as a means of integrating disparate values can also distort the nature of people's investments in politically potent ways.||Wendy Nelson Espeland

Using available evidence it is argued here that EOP treatment like common effluent treatment plant (CETP) does not fix the problem, as many hazardous persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and toxic metals remain in the treated water or in the sludge. Instead of pollution control, pollution prevention should be the aim of any policy intervention. Besides, an integrated system where prevention rather than the control is the norm along with the use of cleaner production is more relevant in a fast growing economy like India.||Vinish Kathuria

It clearly demonstrates that the project was undesirable right from 1992. The project would be disastrous even if MSEB were to function in an efficient manner, agricultural tariff were to be doubled, and power demand were to grow at an unprecedented rate. The committee also recommends radical restructuring of the project so as to drastically reduce the tariff as well as the burden on MSEB by half (i e, by Rs 3,000 crore/year). The chairman and another member have also highlighted the inevitability of constituting a judicial commission of inquiry in order to free MSEB/GoM from the irrational contract and to ensure that those responsible for the 'governance failure' be made accountable. This paper discusses the observations and findings of the committee and its importance.||Prayas Energy Group

There are also shrines and sacred sites that possess a dual identity - they are both a dargah and a temple at the same time; deities bear both Hindu and Islamic names and priests of both communities officiate at ceremonies.||J.

Not only was work intermittent, there were no safety provisions while wages varied from contractor to contractor. With the setting up of the Bombay Dock Labour Board, a modicum of social security was provided for against sudden economic crises and during times of recession. Since the 1980s, however, changes that included the emergence of JNPT, subcontracting of workers, new modes of work, implementation of retirement schemes, among other measures have resulted in financial difficulties for the board. This paper deliberates on the conditions of labour that existed in ports of the pre-independence period and then seeks to analyse the impact of globalisation in context of the dock workers.||Ernesto Noronha

It is in the backdrop of the ambiguities of the national movement, which were partly a result of nationalist responses to colonial rule, that one can understand some of the anomalies in the public sphere as it currently exists in India. In any consideration of the public sphere its relation to the private sphere cannot be neglected for it is in its relation to the private sphere that the public is itself defined and given shape. Institutionalising multiculturalism in the public sphere will involve a renegotiation of the relationship between the two spheres.

How and to what extent has it affected growth in agriculture? These questions have been at the centre stage of a debate sparked off in the late 1980s. This paper re-visits this debate by dissecting different components of capital formation, by digging into the very concept and estimation procedures followed in the Indian system of National Accounts vis-à-vis the UN system. The study, after re-defining and re-estimating trends in capital formation in agriculture, concludes that the situation is definitely not good, but not as alarming as is sometimes made out to be. This is because of the increasing share and role of private sector investments in agriculture over time. And the trend in that has remained robust despite decline in public sector capital formation in agriculture, and despite the fact that public sector investment has an inducement effect on private sector capital formation. This only goes to suggest that private sector investment in agriculture has been increasingly influenced by other factors, especially the terms of trade. And this has implications for the structure of growth within agriculture.||Ashok Gulati,Seema Bathla

This tension reflected the dynamics of the women's organisations and the overweening compulsions of the dominant political elites. For the Muslim League, support for women's rights demonstrated Islam's superiority, while the Congress viewed it as part of the nationalist project of state building, which included improving the status of women. Women's organisations, for the most part, lacked the influence necessary to set the policy agenda in arenas of personal law or political representation and remained dependant on political allies among the nationalist and state elites.||Jana Everett

This essay is an attempt to examine the impact of the attacks on exchange rates, stock prices and prices of some commodities. Our results demonstrate that the impact on stock prices is short-lived whereas the effect on exchange rates is persistent. We also note that exchange rates behave differently for developed countries compared to the developing ones. Finally, movement of commodity prices in India is similar to that of global prices.||Kausik Chaudhuri,Rudra Sensarma

Although the share of services in GDP is over 50 per cent, its contribution to tax revenue is not commensurate. Further, the prevailing taxes on services are overlapping and haphazard and are not conducive to the evolution of a coordinated value added tax at central and state levels. Besides, it is important to extend the tax also for reasons of revenue. The paper argues that for evolving a rational consumption tax system it is important to levy a general tax on services rather than continuing with the selective taxation prevailing at present. However, there should be a small but well defined exemption list and a negative list to avoid taxing services arising from the sovereign functions of the state and services of a meritorious nature. There should also be a threshold to exclude small service providers. At the central level it is also suggested that by 2004-05 service tax should be merged with the MODVAT to evolve a manufacturing stage value added tax. In the case of states, it is argued that to evolve a destination based retail stage value added tax, it is necessary to give concurrent powers to tax all services subject to certain safeguards to ensure orderly development of the consumption tax system.||M.

For doing so, partial information about future inflation rate provided by a number of basic series is analysed first. Based on the correlation analysis, a few of these basic series are chosen for construction of composite indicator. Empirical results show that the percentage change in manufacturing output, money stock, exchange rate, bank credit to commerical sector, raw material prices, are important leading indicators for inflation rate in India. Accordingly, based on monthly data on these basic series, one composite indicator is constructed which contains information about behaviour of inflation rate six months in advance. It is seen that out-of-sample forecast error of the composite indicator is quite impressive, the magnitude of error in six-months ahead forecast is only 1.2 percentage point.||Abhay Pethe,G. P.

To achieve this, it is necessary to disaggregate the mortality data to identify groups or regions with high IMR levels and to intensify efforts to reduce mortality among these sections. Only then can a rapid reduction be made in the aggregate mortality levels. However, given wide variations in mortality levels among different states, such analyses should be state-specific. This paper analyses the infant and child mortality data for West Bengal in space through the district-level estimates and in time through the state-level estimates, comparing these with all-India figures. While the performance of the state has been well above the all-India average, mortality levels are high in certain regions and among certain groups. It is necessary to intensify efforts to reduce these through specific micro-planning. Similar state-specific analyses are necessary for other states and will serve useful purpose for design of policy.||Satish B. Agnihotri

One of the major policy changes affecting the financial markets has been reduction in government's recourse to claims on loanable funds through statutory liquidity ratio as well as high levels of Cash Reserve Ratios. The central government has switched to market borrowing to finance its fiscal deficit on a larger scale than before. There is a general move towards market determined rates and flows in the financial sector. One area where administered rates are still important is the small saving instruments. The government sets these interest rates and mobilises funds for meeting the fiscal deficits at the centre and more so at the state level. If these rates were to be determined by the markets, what would happen to the interest rates in general. One argument is that the small saving rates act as a floor to the deposit rates of the banking sector and hence also determine the lending rates. If the overall balance of demand and supply of loanable funds is such that interest rates can be lower, the small saving rates do not let that emerge. Further, as interest rates decline, there would be significant gains in economic growth. This paper is an attempt to examine this viewpoint. We develop a monetarist model of the economy and assess the implications of alternative methods of financing the fiscal deficit of the government, central and states combined. The results support the view that overall interest rates would decline if the small saving rates were to be liberalised but the gains in economic growth would not be dramatic.||Deepak Lal,Shashanka Bhide,Deepa Vasudevan

While the development of such organisations is a source of hope, to what extent do these new protests reflect the demands of organisations and states in developing nations?

Gradual devolution of power to the provinces and the localities, once seen as an avenue to build up power, now appear as a chaotic mesh of competing markets.

But these may not evenly benefit male and female children especially if the girl children are unable to access the improved health infrastructure and nutritional support. The consequent gender gap in mortality is a good index of discrimination against the girl children. Analysis of time series data on infant and child mortality of major Indian states indicates a more rapid decline in male mortality rates as mortality levels decline. However, many states known for their gender bias do show evidence of the 'substitution effect', i e, more rapid decline in female infant and child mortality rates in the wake of increasing incidence of pre-natal selection. It is argued here, however, that a mere improvement in mortality rates among 'surviving' girl children does not mean an improvement in the quality of their survival.||Satish B. Agnihotri

The suavity of his parliamentary performance had depth. The Lok Sabha gradually lost its lustre, it became plebianised without being proletarianised. Gupta had little illusion about the effectiveness of setting aside precious hours that could have been used for trade union work for silly parliamentary chores.

Liberals have been squeezed out by the identity politics of the left, which holds that caste is and should be the fundamental axis of Indian society, and by the identity politics of the right, which assigns a hegemonic role to religion.||Ramachandra Guha

The characteristics attributed to prakrti, matter, and purusha, the spirit, are identified with the physical woman and man, respectively. It might also be construed that the constructions of the nature of prakrti and purusha reflected the roles of women and men in early societies.

For example, the overall improvement in sex ratio in favour of females may be explained by the fact that female death rates have become lower than the male death rates. But the sex raio at birth (SRB) becoming more favourable to males has, however, influenced the overall sex ratio in the opposite direction, which is reflected in the adverse child sex ratio. Child sex ratios in Punjab and Haryana, especially with the adverse sex ratio at birth of point towards rampant practice of female foeticide along with a certain amount of infanticide in these two states. The fact that Uttar Pradesh and Uttaranchal both have registered an improvement in overall sex ratio between 1991 and 2001, but with the child sex ratio declining sharply requires a detailed probing.

Though internal divisions of caste and class remain, as does factionalism among different Hindu organisations in the state, the primary goal for the parivar in the utilisation of such rituals is to persuade all Hindus to become conscious of belonging to a single, majority 'community', rather than to initiate a campaign of social engineering to overcome caste divisions.||C.

Such an analysis has become even more improtant now in the context of the new international trading regime under the aegis of the WTO which covers issues which have an important bearing on the ability of national governments in regulating the patterns of FDI inflows. This paper presents some findings of a comprehensive attempt to quantitatively analyse the role of structural, geographical and policy factors in shaping the patterns of MNE activity. The focus is on the role of host government policies and on the implications of the emerging WTO regime in their light.||Nagesh Kumar

The peculiar genius of Indian misgovernance is that, while complying with transparency requirements in a superficial sense, there are enough exceptions and anomalies tucked away in the system for it to achieve obfuscation to an impressive degree. The Group was advantageously placed in terms of its membership to ferret out examples where there is de jure compliance, but none de facto. It does not do this. Further, the RORB is largely confined to compliance at the central government level. It does deal to some degree with inter-government issues between centre and states, but not with state-local issues.||Indira Rajaraman

However the census does not include individual/household consumption and expenditure data, making its use in district-level policy analysis difficult. One way around the problem is to import this information from other sources, such as the National Sample Survey (NSS). Although the NSS does not sample every district in the country the sample sizes are reasonably large at the level of the NSS region. This opens up the possibility of using these estimates of consumption and poverty in conjunction with the census. This paper documents how a consistent time-series can be constructed for the two most recent censuses as a particular illustration of how the census and the NSS can be used together.||Mamta Murthi,P.

Challenging the postmodernist and postcolonial critics who reduce the Euro-American Enlightenment to discourses of western imperialism and patriarchy, the author seeks to recover the critical impulse behind it and attempts to find cultural homologues for an Enlightenment-style 'revolt against superstition' in Indian society. By analysing how Hindu dharma naturalises hierarchy and patriarchy, the paper argues for the need for a scientific demystification of the order of nature. Without a critical engagement with the content of Hinduism's sacred tenets, it is argued here, secularisation of consciousness and culture cannot succeed.||Meera Nanda

With lower levels of market protection and faster economic liberalisation, the recent Indian experience suggests that liberal import policies can gloom the competitiveness and hence growth prospects of domestic dairy industry.

This calls for an in-depth analysis of the institutional mechanism that drives informal trade and the reasons for such trade to take place. An analysis carried out on the basis of a field survey in the border areas of Nepal and India reveals that informal traders have developed efficient institutional mechanisms for contract enforcement, information flows, risk sharing and risk mitigation. Analysing the relative importance of trade policy barriers vis-a-vis institutional and other non-economic factors influencing informal trade flows the study shows that informal traders provide better solutions to circumvent the inadequacies and inefficiencies of the formal trade channel.||Nisha Taneja,Sanjib Pohit

Until recently the debate on the wisdom of positive discrimination policies has been largely theoretical, appealing to ethical considerations and political-philosophical values. Now, however, systematic empirical evidence on the long-term consequences of affirmative action policies in admissions to US colleges and universities has at last been made available and can be brought to bear on the discussion.||Thomas E.

But budgets cannot promote growth or even arrest the process of slowing down if the fundamentals are not addressed squarely and carefully. These fundamentals belong to the sphere of political economy and are not just economic or financial. They are the long-term factors which determine the outcomes of policies.

But achieving such a homogeneity proves elusive and the search becomes an exercise in peeling an onion, which involves the shedding of people who do not fit the constructed identity or who question the accepted framework. This in turn prompts the construction of minority identities which strive to build a majority for themselves. In the subcontinent the search for nationhood has always focused on ethnicity, culture and religion, but what has emerged is a heterogeneous mix of people who should have represented diversity but now have one culture, the middle class culture and one identity, the middle class identity.||Sajal Nag

The devolution of funds from the centre to the states takes the form of share of the revenue raised by central taxes and grants-in-aid. An individual state's tax revenue collection, relative to its taxable capacity, is a major determinant of the amount of funds to be allocated for the state. This paper examines the relative tax performances of some selected states based on annual data on state tax revenue for the period 1986-87 to 1996-97 using the technique of Quantile Regression.||Dipankor Coondoo,Amita Majumber,Robin Mukherjee,Chiranjib Neogi

Through a comparative analysis of the survival strategies that fisherfolk households have forged in two communities in Trivandrum district - one Christian, one Muslim - the author examines how development has differentially unfolded in these two locales as a result of different local geographic particularities. This necessarily requires a consideration of women's economic activities as well as an examination of gender ideology and its mediation of men's and women's unique experiences of the development process. Not only do women and men experience economic processes differently as a result of gender, but difference in ideologies of gender help explain, in part, how development can differentially impact separate communities in the same region.||Holly M.

Due to a rise in the income velocity of base money this has created an incentive for the government to resort more to market borrowings from banks which has raised real interest rates and which exerts a depressing impact on the growth of economic activity along with creating pressures for the inflation rate to increase. The changed environment calls for a reduction in government expenditures which, whilst reducing interest rates and enhancing the level of economic activity, will also help nudge the economy to a lower inflation level.||Errol D'Souza

Key results include a slower growth of workforce relative to that of population; a reduction in the share and size of the workforce in agriculture and in community, social and personal services; and widespread gains in labour productivity getting translated into equally widespread and significant growth in average wage earnings per worker and per capita.||K.

New production and processing methods driven by biotechnology (genetically modified organisms (GMOs), hormones and other growth promoters) affect food safety. Are alternative more sustainable patterns of food production and consumption feasible? The paper examines some consumer initiatives in Asia and in the UK to examine how the consumer as a 'market force' can proactively influence the food industry, thereby making sustainable practices the norm rather than the exception. It also looks at the significance of empowering women, as consumers, with awareness and education on food safety, nutrition and its dependence on sustainable practices to exert a 'pull' on the market. Finally the paper discusses a multi-pronged approach involving, besides consumer pressure, policy changes, regulatory efforts and economic instruments to steer food production and consumption in a more sustainable direction.||Radha Gopalan

Gender is one layer in this complexity, and is one of the most basic aspects of a realistic impacts assessment. Gender is fundamental to equity and distribution. Due to the far-reaching transformations initiated by large dams, it is essential to ensure that the negative impacts do not outweight the positive ones. Therefore, an integration of gender is indispensable in any process that seeks to formulate equity principles.||Bina Srinivasan

We invoke some simple arguments regarding schooling, human capital theory and signalling from the economics of human resources to theoretically inform our analysis. The results indicate that there are large salary returns to academic performance and mild returns to prior work experience when the entire sample is studied. However, when the functions are run separately for the domestic and international sector, we find that only academic performance is significant in the domestic sector whereas only prior work experience is significant in the international sector. We interpret the latter result as approximating a 'perfectly separating signalling equilibrium' process.||Debashish Bhattacherjee,Karthik Krishna,Amol Karve

In India, besides forex market interventions and use of several administrative measures, the Reserve Bank of India has occasionally resorted to the high interest rate option during major episodes of significant pressures on the external value of the rupee. An empirical assessment suggests that one standard deviation shock to the call rate leads to rupee appreciation in the very second month. Similarly, for one standard deviation shock to net interventions, the exchange rate appreciates gradually by a few paise over five months. The impulse response also suggests that in response to one standard deviation shock the exchange rate appreciates by about 8 paise in the second month, but subsequently the exchange rate depreciates gradually, more than offsetting the initial impact of the hike in interest rate.||Sitikantha Pattanaik,Arghya Kusum Mitra

A comparison is undertaken for the year 1993-94 between NAS estimate of PFCE and household consumer expenditure estimated from NSS disaggregated across item-groups of consumption and across selected fractile groups of the rural and urban population. Two alternative estimates from NAS - old series in NAS 1998 and the latest revision in NAS 1999 - are compared. Similarly, two alternative NSS estimates are considered - one directly available using a uniform 30-day reference or recall period and a synthetic one constructed to reflect the effect of using non-uniform reference period. The analysis of comparison of these four estimates suggests two major conclusions. One, the issue of accepting NAS estimate of PFCE as more correct and reliable than NSS estimate is far from settled. Two, the item-groups that accounted for a very large proportion of the aggregate discrepancy between NAS and NSS estimates had a much smaller budget share in the consumption basket of the bottom 30 per cent fractile group in the rural and urban areas, whereas in respect of item-groups which together accounted for over 75 per cent of the consumption of the bottom 30 per cent, the divergence between the two estimates was much smaller than on the average for all item groups and negative in some cases.||K.

The decline in Indian exports during 1996-97 was due mainly to a fall in the growth rate of export volumes. This analysis brings out the nature of demand-side factors, as against supply-side bottlenecks, that have constricted the growth of exports. However, easing of supply-side constraints too would have aided the revival of export growth.||Nilanjan Banik

The author examines the pattern of inter-disciplinary relations that is revealed in these examples, focusing on issues of differential inter-disciplinary prestige, inter-disciplinary borrowing, and the maturation cycles of inter-disciplinary fields. It conclude; with an examination, through parodies of CBA, of how emotional responses to boundary-crossing have led towards a partial and flawed vision of CBA and highlights the need to simultaneously both use and problematise CBA.||Michael R.

This paper attempts to analyse the feasibility and the validity of both measuring social capital at the level of the states and identifying its role in explaining the differential performance of states. It identifies three types of problems in the application of this methodology to interstate analysis: finding appropriate measures for social capital; locating alternative indicators valid for interstate analysis; and interpreting the statistical association between social capital and state performance.||Renata Serra

The popular conception that this is always the case is not necessarily supported by empirical evidence. This gap between theory and evidence is due to the incomplete theorisation of the link between exchange rate policy and BMP. This paper discusses two additional channels through which BMP is affected. One is the income effect consequent upon employment and real income expansion that raises the black market dollar demand. The other is the variation in export quality that may raise the black market dollar supply. These effects work in opposite directions and together with the usual effects make the change in BMP less certain than predicted in the existing literature.||Rajat Acharyya

Free market advocates all too often tend to undermine the unruly behaviour of stock markets in the post liberalisation scenario. On the other hand, opponents believe that stock market reforms may lead to over-speculation, financial crisis and even a misallocation of resources at the cost of real sector growth and stability, as has been seen in the case of India. However, there is now an increasing recognition in LDCs that given the competition for foreign funding and limited availability of domestic finance, the equity market can play a beneficial role in providing capital to the productive sector as well as facilitate the process of privatisation.||M.

All this is true of West Bengal, where migrant workers employed in rice cultivation have made crucial contributions to the agricultural successes of the last two decades. West Bengal's gangs of mobile rice workers are recruited directly by individual employers at busy labour market places or in migrants' home villages. This paper summarises the findings of recent empirical research on the scale and pattern of seasonal migration for rice work in West Bengal. It analyses the causes and consequences of the migration, including its relation to ongoing social change in four source areas.||Ben Rogaly,Jhuma Biswas,Daniel Coppard,Abdur Rafique,Kumar Rana,Amrita Sengupta

It appears likely that rising incomes led to a greater demand for local public goods and also helped the citizenry to articulate this demand in a politically effective way. History may have played an important role by delaying, though not halting, the devolution of power to the local level in states which inherited centralised bureaucracies. While some of the pattern of evolution seems explicable, much remains to be understood, in particular why centralised absolutist states evolved so differently in Scandinavia as compared to France, Spain, and Italy.||E.

Putting in place a proper policy framework may not only restore normalcy in the region, but can start a recovery boom. Estimating the loss from the earthquake is important for devising policies and drawing up requirements for assistance both from within and outside India. However, given all the limitations of the data, firm estimates of losses from the recent quake will take time to compile. In the interim, quantification is critical for designing relief and rehabilitation packages and implementing them before the onset of the monsoon. This paper is an attempt to estimate the economic impact of the earthquake.||Ashok K. Lahiri,Tapas K. Sen,R. Kavita Rao,Pratap Ranjan Jena

Simultaneously, the government of India has also initiated measures for carefully monitoring and regulating the import liberalisation process ushered in by the Exim policy 2001-02. Based on these developments, this paper advocates rigorous negotiation positions and proactive programmes of development in order to address the pressing problems arising from the AoA. Developing countries, whose agrarian economies are characterised by 'ecosystemic multifunctionality', have the scope for providing income diversification opportunities for the weaker sections of the farming communities through development of common property resources. This then could form the best safety net to contain the fallout of the agri-agreement.||A. Damodaran

Joint Forest Management (JFM) is restricted to management of forests as providers of forest and non-timber forest products. This paper investigates in detail the extensive indigenous knowledge of such local ecological services among a forest community. It argues that local ecological services are the missing link in designing plans for successful decentralisation and sustainable management of forests. Enlisting such local knowledge, as is done in this paper, is the first step to incorporating it in the management of forests.||Sanjay Kumar

Despite its popularity, social capital has created an undercurrent of opposition from progressive scholars with intellectual integrity. As this article argues, they have not been more numerous and outspoken, precisely because it is very hard to generate serious debate and disagreement. Individual advancement aside - an important factor in the rise of social capital - all it reveals is much by way of intellectual bankruptcy and a failure to recognise how social capital's ready accommodation of opposition represents a highly successful form of a legitimising repressive tolerance.||Ben Fine

Many enthusiasts of privatisation seem to believe that a shift from public to private ownership will automatically make for improved performance. Yet there is little in economic theory or the empirical evidence on privatisation that lends support to such a simplistic belief. The evidence on the impact of privatisation is by no means unmixed. In particular, in less developed countries, where law enforcement and corporate governance tend to be weak, private ownership does not necessarily make for better performance. It is possible, based on the research on privatisation, to draw some tentative conclusions for privatisation policy in a context such as ours.||T. T. Ram Mohan

It illustrates through counterfactual simulations how the benefit-cost ratio for the PDS increases when subsidies are targeted at the poor and indirect benefits are accounted for, even in a scenario where PDS grain is procured at market prices. However, administration of directly targeted PDS is difficult and can lead to the error of excluding the poor. The paper therefore examines the inefficiencies in the system, comparing costs of public storage and distribution operations with those of private agents and discusses how the rising government costs can be curtailed by making administration more efficient and relying on market forces for spatial distribution of grain. Finally, it discusses the issues involved in the targeting of PDS to the poor and examines the potential for geographic targeting.||Shikha Jha,P. V. Srinivasan

It is achieved through intentional or unintentional transmission of ideas and techniques from one culture area to another. In ancient times it usually was spread over a longer period of time, even a few centuries, unlike present times. One such interesting transmission occurred between India and China during medieval period when Sino-Indian Buddhist contacts were followed by scientific/medical contacts as well. The origin of this transmission is traced to the Buddhist canonical literature in Chinese which sprang up with the introduction of Buddhism into China in the late Han period (AD 25-220). Chinese historical, popular literature as well as medical works then reflected the influence of Indian medicine for over a millennium. Two Chinese works on ophthalmology, which appeared between the 8th and the 12th century AD, were attributed to Nagarjuna indicating inclusion of Indian ophthalmological material into Chinese medicine. These writings exhibit an integration of the two medical systems. The silk route which linked China to India, Arabia and further west was thus a bridge between the eastern and western civilisation, as well as promoting scientific exchanges and mutual cooperation along with exchange of goods.||Vijaya Deshpande

Among the explanatory variables, we incorporate, in addition to the standard set of variables, regulatory requirement variables. Our analysis reveals that (i) size does not necessarily correlate with higher spread, and (ii) higher fee income enables banks to tolerate lower spreads. With regard to regulatory requirement variables, it is found that (i) capital plays an important role in affecting spreads of public sector banks, and (ii) non-performing assets is uniformly important across all bank groups in influencing spreads.||R.

The economic reforms from 1991 onwards were meant to reverse the situation and have made a successful contribution. And yet we hear again sceptical voices against the reforms. Since a spirited response is necessary to prevent a roll back to the counterproductive policies of the past, it is useful to examine a few arguments against reforms in the public policy debate today that have superficial and hence popular appeal.

In particular, the data show that, in the post-reform period, investment in government securities by banks has remained persistently high and there has been a significant reduction in the flow of credit (as a proportion of deposits) to the real sectors of the economy. There have also been significant changes in the flow of credit to various groups and sectors within the economy, some of which might be thought not to be in conformity with the stated social goals of the government.||Prabir C.

This was when the monarchy, the court, the palaces were all established on a grand scale. But the process of establishing Mughal forms - including its practices, institutions, cities, imperial splendour - occurred over a period of time. By the latter half of Akbar's reign, the empire had become increasingly well rooted and by then had come to be presented as sacred. Another related development in the process of imperial construction was the emphasis on its disciplinary aspect, which in turn had deep implications on the domestic world of the divine monarch.||Ruby Lal

The pretence of perfect competition helps the expansion of monopoly in the system, for it enables the strong to confront in the market the weak, who are crushed in no time. To assuage their left-over morality the rich have also developed a second-order formulation: if a tiny fragment of the population turn out to be filthily rich, a part of their income will trickle down and take care of the problems of the poor. Nationally as well as internationally, we are at the moment helpless victims of such trivial theorisations and actions based on them.||A. M.

The first was when agricultural consumption was de-metered and extensive subsidies were offered; the second when Independent Power Producer contracts with major fiscal implications were signed by the State Electricity Boards. A third set of circumstances, with the potential for equally powerful forms of institutional lock-in, appears to be in the making with the reproduction of the Orissa model on the national scale. This paper provides an analysis of the social and political context in which power sector reforms have taken place in India. While a state-led power sector has been responsible for substantial failures, is the design of the reformed sector well aimed at balancing efficiency and profit-making on the one hand and the public interest on the other? The discussion of the forces and actors that have shaped the reform processes is intended to contribute to an understanding of how the public interest can best be served in the ongoing effort to reshape the power sector.||Navroz K.

The simultaneous urbanisation and the spread of individualism have led to a widespread concern about the living conditions of the aged population. The possible role of state-sponsored or non-familial sources of support to enable them to live with self-respect and without undue hardship needs to be explored. The ministry of social welfare has set up an expert groups for a review of the relevant facts and possible policies. This paper attempts to present a comprehensive review of the available data on the subject and highlights the difficulties in obtaining precise estimates of the number of the aged and of their actual needs. It also presents a summary of the key results of two large surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) during 1987-88 and 1995-96.||Pravin Visaria

However there is a need to resolve whether the two conceptions, are themselves incompatible with one another. And it is the Indian 'nation state' will have to play the role, not of an enemy but of a powerful and probably benevolent mediator. Manipur, probably the last vestige of a real composite cultural and political character in the Indian subcontinent, should not in the interim become a sacrificial lamb for establishing the political legitimacy of the Indian 'nation state'.||A.

Principal amongst these was the role of the port and a trade regime based on import substituting industrialisation. The latter no longer prevails but the former has a major role to play in the new trade regime. The impact of globalisation and a government sponsored export-oriented trade liberalisation programme with supply side support measures places the manufacturing sector as the central economic driver and creates new opportunities for the city. Whether the city can respond accordingly depends on how firms, industrial sectors, key stakeholders, national institutions controlling the port, and local government react to this new scenario. A study of the clothing and automotive industries highlights a number of pertinent issues which would seem to be generic to manufacturing in Durban generally.||Mike Morris,Justin Barnes,Nikki Dunne

Collection of data on different types of irrigation systems in the state has been left to different agencies. These agencies are not geared to systematic collection of statistics and the data provided by them are not regular and are often inconsistent. As a result, no reliable statistics exist that could be used to identify patterns of irrigation at the state-level - leave aside doing such exercises at district, block or village levels - with a level of accuracy that is possible for some of the other states. This paper provides an overview of the different sources of data on irrigation in West Bengal and discusses the nature of the data available from each source.||Vikas Rawal

Targeted food subsidy schemes, however, have costs, which are ignored or not fully accounted for by policy-makers. This article focuses on costs arising out of the two types of targeting errors - errors of exclusion and errors of inclusion - in the system of public distribution of food in India or the PDS. Using primary data from a village in Maharashtra, at two subsequent surveys, the authors show that errors of wrong inclusion decreased while errors of wrong exclusion increased with a shift from universal to targeted coverage. The article also demonstrates the pitfalls of identifying a target group based on an income indicator.||Madhura Swaminathan,Neeta Misra

There appears to be some arbitrariness in the lending pattern of the IMF.||Raghbendra Jha,Mridul K. Saggar

The study of civil society and social capital allows for the study of conflict over resources or group domination. The theoretical significance of social capital is not tht it will necessarily lead to societal peace and harmony, nor does its study necessarily exclude politics and political conflict. The point is to focus attention on non-material resources at the micro-level and their possible impact on the macro-level. Whether these resources, the social capital, are structured on the basis of class, caste, religious group or geographical belonging is open to empirical investigation.||Hans Blomkvist,Ashok Swain

This process depends largely on the nature of the institutional arrangement in the sector, where usury capital has a strong presence due to the influence of the merchant lender, the 'mahajan'. The deskilling tendency associated with the relation between the producer and the mahajan and the unity of conception and execution in some cases are among the characteristics that describe this labour process.||Ratan Khasnabis,Pranab Nag

The elective course, Tracking Creative Boundaries, designed for students at IIM, Bangalore, seeks to inculcate this aspect by introducing students to artistes, all masters in their own chosen fields. Not only is society best represented by the arts, but also because artistes have always had the capacity to inspire. Their ability to transform themselves and thereby the wider environment as well is brought about by their constant endeavour to reinvent themselves, while respecting their own vocations - a lesson that could stand in equal good stead for the business leaders of tomorrow.||Ramnath Narayanswamy

It uses a comparative analysis of all-India figures with Gujarat, one of the most industrially developed states of the country. The study shows that both the organised and unorganised sectors in Gujarat seemed to be doing better than the all-India average in terms of growth of value added. Growth in the manufacturing sector in Gujarat was also more efficient than average all-India growth after the reforms were introduced. Gujarat's strategy of physical infrastructure development, leading to industrialisation, has been the main reason for the growth of the state's manufacturing sector.||Jeemol Unni,N. Lalitha,Uma Rani

It is through the fall in the supply of local environmental services, like nutrient recycling and soil formation, that forest communities bear the external costs that are not included in the price of timber and other forest products. Local environmental services are taken into account in forest management decisions by local communities, but not by external agents, like forest departments, and form a basis for setting up local forest management systems. In arguing for the establishment of forest communities' property rights over forests, the paper supports the establishment of markets for regional and global environmental services provided by forests.||Dev Nathan,Govind Kelkar

Although there has been wide coverage in the press of tumbling prices for 'green' coffee and their repercussions on rural livelihoods in producing countries, not much has been said on the long-term changes that have taken place in the global coffee marketing chain. This has resulted in the widespread belief that the coffee crisis is simply about oversupply. This paper shows that changes in the international coffee trade regime, in regulation at the domestic level in producing countries, and in corporate strategies have also been at the root of the crisis. Finally, it gives specific policy directions to constructively address the emerging imbalances.||Stefano Ponte

While the bill will enable the creation of markets, facilitate the process of private investment in transmission, improve grid discipline and ease somewhat the working of the regulatory commissions, success in improving the supply and quality of electricity and the financial performance of the power sector will depend, in the ultimate analysis, on the speed with which the state electricity boards can be made financially viable.

All hopes have been pinned on the revival of industrial demand through possible improvement in agricultural growth in the current year following copious rainfall so far. However, because this beneficial impact, if it occurs, follows two years of falling incomes in the sector, it is not likely to be either significant or immediate.

It is only fair that dams are opened to public scrutiny and informed debate on performance, benefits and negative impacts. The World Commission on Dams (WCD) created to address the conflicting positions around the dams debate, gathered a wide cross section of information, experiences and perspectives to unfold the dams story to the public arena. Despite the diversity of views represented by the commissioners, the main conclusions of the WCD final report are consensual. What WCD has provided through its intensive consultative process and its final report is an impartial and informed basis for continued dialogue involving all stakeholders. Greater and more constructive engagement in the WCD process provides the opportunity to end acrimonious encounters, restore confidence of all stakeholders to reach a settlement and reaffirm their commitment and responsibility towards equitable and sustainable development.||S.

A similar, although far less extensive, natural catastrophe occurred during the monsoon season, 2000, when the worst floods in 60 years ravaged Ahmedabad.

Patrick Blackett and Military and Scientific Development of India||It is difficult to give a measure of Patrick Blackett's wide-ranging influence in India. He had no official status in defence matters except as an advisor to Nehru. Since his consultations were not widely known, his public reputation, nor surprisingly, was largely in the field of scientific research institution building. In this capacity he advocated a realistic appraisal of the relations between the state and the military, and limitations on the military's growth and influence. It is not as a mililtary consultant, however, but as an intervenor in scientific affairs and advisor to the research system that Blackett was and is best known in India. He came to understand its political-economy, specifically the political limits of the influence of the scientific community and the way in which very scarce economic resources were (or were not) mobilised within it. Blackett's objectives in India are enduring: to improve the working conditions of people doing research; to cut away the bureaucratic brambles which grow around the practice of research; to think carefully about the things which can be developed locally instead of being imported, to balance the state's insatiable desire for technical prestige with enhancing ordinary peoples' abilities to provide a better life for themselves.||Robert S.

In its initial years, the movement failed to garner a strong support base owing to the long-standing sufi tradition in Kashmir. However, since the 1980s, the Jama'at-i-Islami Jammu and Kashmir has attempted to restructure the framework of the discourse within which the Kashmiri armed struggle has sought to express itself - the struggle is now being interpreted as a holy war. Not only has there been a growing intervention of Islamist groups based in Pakistan, the nationalist goal of a free Kashmir is being increasingly marginalised.||Yoginder Sikand

Two broad components of the informal economy, i e, non-wage and wage employment are distinguished. The share of the first component has been rising in the last two decades. Within non-wage employment, certain invisible groups of workers, such as home-based workers and street vendors are vulnerable to changes in the global and local economy. The increasing casualisation of the workforce is evidence of an increase in the second broad component. Within wage employment, homeworkers or outworkers and informal workers in the formal enterprises are vulnerable. The low quality of employment available to women in the informal economy is brought out by evidence on the wages and incomes received and differentials in earnings.||Jeemol Unni

Current efforts to mainstream microfinance operations in the non-financial sector of the country, while acknowledging the failure of state-owned credit institutions, should also take into account, among others, the programmatic success of several intermediary developmental institutions like the small savings and credit groups that have proved not only profitable but an effective poverty alleviation measure.||Tara S.

Within and between wet and dry villages the 'caste' differences in food intake between backward castes (BCs) and scheduled castes (SCs) were examined. Findings showed that the majority of sample households survived on cereals, and had only one main meal per day, a stark indicator of food insecurity. Female-headed households were the most adversely affected 'poverty group' in the study villages irrespective of caste. The landless peoples' lack of basic needs (clothing, shelter, household equipment, and health care) revealed much more of their utter destitution than conventional food intake.||A. K. Rajuladevi

Restructuring Asia's Pacific Rim after Crash of 1997-98||When the reigning orthodoxy has used the Asian economic crisis of 1997-98 to retrospectively indict administratively guided industrialisation strategies, this article argues that it was the very success of 'developmental states' that rendered national industrial plans increasingly incoherent. It demonstrates that the progressive cross-border expansion of production and procurement networks eroded the competence of regulatory mechanisms and led to an uncoordinated expansion of production. At the same time, the accelerated transfer of manufacturing operations to low-wage areas did not correspondingly expand markets. The resulting crisis has exposed fissures in the social bases of support that ruling elites had been able to paper over during years of rapid economic growth. In this context, the reforms imposed by the IMF have led to a transfer of corporate assets in the ailing economies to overseas investors and further constrained policy options for governments. Most notably, this analysis indicates that the economic crisis is merely the surface manifestation of a much deeper crisis: the collapse of the political coalitions that had made the developmental state feasible. Hence, no economic or financial 'fix' is likely to provide a tourniquet and the region is likely to face prolonged instability.||Ravi Arvind Palat

Yet, in Tailism and the Dialectic, Georg Lukács - perhaps the most influential figure in Western Marxism - strongly endorses the existence of an objective dialectic in nature. A close examination of Lukács's main writings on science shows, however, that he still in effect denied the possibility of applying dialectical method to nature. This paradox is bound up with a dualistic conception of natural and social science with distinctly adverse implications for the development of an ecological Marxism.||Paul Burkett

In the last half century we have added to this. But in our enthusiasm to do more and better, the official statistical agencies and their economic and statistical advisors have tended to centralise thinking and designing and processing of the information.

Domestic violence needs to be recognised as abusive and as a crime. Asian men use violence as a way of securing and maintaining the relations of male dominance and female subordination, which is central to the patriarchal social order. It is essential that various theoretical works on domestic violence in New Zealand recognise and understand the variation in cultural and familial constraints experienced by different groups of ethnic-minority Asian immigrant and refugee women. Despite the fact that a wide range of interventionist services exist and there is a very progressive legislation against domestic violence in New Zealand due to various cultural and structural constraints, Asian women find it difficult to access them. This article examines these issues and in conclusion suggests that the Asian community take responsibility to address this issue as well as the perpetrators.||Suma Pillai

Remedial tree felling was conducted under the guise of ecological action, exposing the economic undercurrents. The government investigations conducted mostly by the state forest department were mere cover-ups. Following the central government and Supreme Court directives prohibiting tree felling, the pest attack has declined, falsifying the official speculations of an intensification.||Utkarsh Ghate

However, the implicit notion that well-being of individuals and households will be enhanced through the gaining of employment is too often assumed rather than established.

The engagement can also be at a more philosophical level, namely, the foundational assumptions of the discipline. This paper seeks to explore these themes.||Maithreyi Krishnaraj

Part I deals with physical performance focusing on such aspects, as technical efficiency, T and D losses, and their possible underestimation as well as some aspects of institutional and organisational inefficiency. Part II, to appear next week, will deal with the supply cost of electricity, tariff and revenue, as well as financial performance.||K. P. Kannan,N. Vijayamohanan Pillai

These are compiled from records of police stations all over the country and refer to reported and registered crime. For recent years the data cover crimes against women in some detail, disaggregated to the district level. Reporting of crime tends to be incomplete; so the data are prima facie suspect. Nevertheless, they may be useful in studying regional variations, considering that underreporting is a universal feature. Social scientists have neglected the study of crime despite its increasing presence in our daily lives. This paper is an attempt to see what official, published data reveal, whether there are clear-cut regional patterns and if so whether they can lead to meaningful hypotheses for future work.||Chandan Mukherjee,Preet Rustagi,N.

This study seeks to initiate that process by looking at the District Primary Education Programme (DPEP) that was subscribed to by most World Bank borrowers, including India, as a social safety net against the social and economic turmoil that followed any structural adjustment processes. In India, the reach of DPEP extended to 240 districts across 16 states, within the first six years of its existence. Despite this, surveys showed a decline in growth at the primary enrolment stage in most Indian states. More disturbing was the increasing presence of the 'para teacher' and the consequent labelling of the full-time teacher as an impediment to the system's further development.||Krishna Kumar,Manisha Priyam,Sadhna Saxena

By calling attention to the interstitial space between truth and reconciliation, it posits new points of departure in reflecting on the tensions of 'factual truth' and 'personal or narrative truth'; memory and evidence; victimhood and resistance; silence and articulation. Working through the non-verbal and gestural dimensions of different performances and testimonials relating to violence, the essay affirms the need for new languages in dealing with the historical traumas of the past. Questioning the validity of commemorating the pain of entire communities through memorial museums, it recontextualises the possibilities of reconciliation beyond the limited time-frame of Truth Commissions into a more dialogic confrontation of the unease underlying any struggle for 'transitional justice'.||Rustom Bharucha

However, this analysis shows that the reforms model being implemented is based on incomplete diagnosis of the Board's past problems. High cost of power purchase, arbitrary depreciation norms, misrepresentation of agriculture consumption and over-reporting of impact of subsidy, were as important reasons as poor maintenance, poor productivity, high T and D losses, poor billing efficiency and high subsidy to agriculture, in affecting financial performance of the Board. Besides lack of recognition of the former set of causes, the reforms process is ridden with other major pitfalls like sabotage-prone gaps in the proposed model and ad hoc handling of its implementation. The proposed reforms model appears to have been conceived out of desperation to escape from financial burden imposed by past mistakes, rather than out of a conscious reorientation of past policies, structures and systems in keeping with international changes in technological and competitive environment.||Anjula Gurtoo,Rahul Pandey

In some states, however, the public distribution system (PDS) works much better than in other states. The undivided state of Bihar (now the new Bihar and Jharkhand) is one of the states in which the policy works poorly. It is important to understand why this is the case. Generally, policy changes and recommendations do not take the specificities of particular states into account. Yet, for the PDS performance to improve in Bihar and Jharkhand, it is absolutely necessary to understand why it works as it does, what the main bottlenecks are and where there are possibilities for improvement, if any. This paper makes such an attempt: it describes the PDS in Bihar and Jharkhand, not only in terms of how it fails and what it does not accomplish, but also in terms of what it is and what it does. It is shown that while many people do benefit from the present set-up, there are also people within almost all categories of stakeholders who are dissatisfied with the large-scale misappropriation of foodgrains. It is argued that there is scope for change, but change requires strategic political manoeuvring and initially a low-key approach in order not to awaken and antagonise strong vested interests.||Jos Mooij

It attempts to draw out implications for the functioning of schools. The first part of this paper looked at the role of teacher's associations and their evolution as a powerful political pressure group in UP. The second part now analyses the impact the teacher's associations have had on the system of finances in UP, and its impact on general educational levels in the state. Even as strikes, demonstrations, sit-ins in support of more emoluments and benefits have become powerful tools in the hands of these associations, schools see a large degree of absenteeism and apathy towards students, while the state government remains unable to meet non-salary expenditure.

14/4/2001-20/4/2001||commentary||4410478||Rebirth of a River||Two almost simultaneous yet dissimilar decisions on the fate of rivers - Australia's decision to release waters to 'restore' the Snowy river and the Indian Supreme Court's judgment on the Sardar Sarovar Project - raises questions once more about notions of 'river planning' and 'harnessing of rivers'. Following environmental concerns about the Snowy's declining flow, a popular agitation that saw a broad-based participation of experts, politicians and even the layman, finally restored to the Snowy much of its previous flow. The judgment will hopefully set a precedent for similar cases, not merely for Australia, but across the world.||Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt

The worm's (or the FBI's) view might tell us how the tragedy was planned and who were involved in the act. In contrast, the bird's (or the scholar's) view tells us why the tragedy occurred and how long it has been in the making. To make sense of the disaster we need to look at it from both angles.||Bhupendra Yadav
03/11/2001-09/11/2001||commentary||4411319||Consequences of the War for Global Economy||Unlike the past history of world capitalism when war could be expected to boost demand and real economic growth, the current scene is more complex. Even if the most optimistic expectations of global expansion of demand are fulfilled, government intervention on a much larger scale in the international markets would be required to channel financial flows to the creation of real assets instead of speculative activities. The prospects could be much more dismal if demand fails to pick up.||Sunanda Sen

It is also likely to result in the elimination of many marginal and subsistence fishermen, who will be forced to sell their fishing rights to big business.||Ramakrishnan Korakandy

The international market, with the exception of China, has similarly entered a state of sustained deceleration. Hence the plight of the wobbly dollar bodies ill as US capitalism lurches from one crisis to another.||Frederic F. Clairmont

The clashes look set to intensify after the next assembly elections.||Raghab Bandyopadhyay
24/2/2001-02/3/2001||------||4410309||Calcutta Diary||What distinguishes the Gujarat cataclysm is the fact that this has been one earthquake where, along with the poor, affluent sections of society have also been substantial sufferers. Perhaps for the first time in the annals of mankind, an earthquake has shaken the confidence of oligarchs. Globalisation and liberalisation have come home to roost. The rich, who were agog at the marvels of western architecture, have had a rude awakening.||A. M.
