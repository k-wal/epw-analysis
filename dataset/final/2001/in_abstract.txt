Their role continued to be significant as long as technology remained labour-intensive and collieries were small and surface-bound. The expansion of the industry and increasing mechanisation saw a decline in women's participation. This paper based on research in the Raniganj coalbelt in eastern India describes how the work of resource extraction becomes gendered, the growing marginalisation of women, and their increasing alienation from access to environmental resources and their transformation into illegitimate and invisible beings.||Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt

The paper investigates local people's knowledge of forest-based ecological services, including water regulation and nutrient recycling, and gender differences in the local knowledge of these services. The paper notes that the Hani have maintained the forest condition quite irrespective of its tenurial status. The reluctance to 'eat the state forest' is attributed to the local understanding that the forests comprise 'critical natural capital' on which their very survival depends.||Wang Qinghua

Reorienting water resources research in the current changed context of declining foreign aid and increasing social and environmental activism means dealing less with issues of technology per se and more with adoption and adaptation of technology, which becomes more of a social or institutional issue. This essay tries to examine water rights conflicts in two connected geographical locales of south Asia: Bihar and Nepal. Because both areas are part of the Ganga basin, the future of Nepal and Bihar are inextricably linked as far as development, in particular of water resources is concerned. The challenges of water management in the Himalaya-Ganga in the decades ahead will depend, to a large extent, on the kind of statesmanship available to balance all three institutional solidarities - regulatory bureaucracy, innovative market and cautionary activism. The alternative is conflict where no one gets anything except lawsuits, demonstrations, delays, intractable disputes, and even violence.||Dipak Gyawali

It has questioned the composition of the Commission, its procedures, the adequacy and representativeness of the sample studied, the 'knowledge base' of the report, the manner in which the report was finalised, and the fairness and objectivity of the analysis and findings. It has also found the Commission's approach to future planning objectionable and unacceptable. This paper attempts to examine some of the criticisms to the WCD and makes a plea for allowing a debate on the various issues raised rather than move towards an uncompromising polarisation of views.||Ramaswamy R.

This paper argues that how we value is an important social and political relationship. Drawing on examples taken from art, federal water projects, and people's efforts to resist them, the author describes some of assumptions behind, and the consequences of, people's efforts to capture or convey value through processes of commensuration: the transforming of qualitative relations into a common metric. The effects of commensuration are complex and variable; as a strategy of valuing, commensuration can create new objects and new relationships between objects; it can systematically exclude certain kinds of valued goods, relations, or people. Commensuration as a means of integrating disparate values can also distort the nature of people's investments in politically potent ways.||Wendy Nelson Espeland

Using available evidence it is argued here that EOP treatment like common effluent treatment plant (CETP) does not fix the problem, as many hazardous persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and toxic metals remain in the treated water or in the sludge. Instead of pollution control, pollution prevention should be the aim of any policy intervention. Besides, an integrated system where prevention rather than the control is the norm along with the use of cleaner production is more relevant in a fast growing economy like India.||Vinish Kathuria

However, rather than providing a full reasoned analysis of the human rights situation, the judgment focuses on the various administrative procedures put in place by the state to deal with the issues arising from the Sardar Sarovar Project. This is rather surprising. Even if we assume that domestic law is underdeveloped with regard to eviction, displacement and rehabilitation, there was substantial guidance from the international level to help the court in reaching a decision.||Philippe Cullet

The link between economic status and access allows the analysis of issues such as water sharing, sole access, ability to pay, need for improvements, etc. The authors also put forth a strategy for levying user charges for different economic status households. The data reveal that poor access is accompanied with low levels of expectations of the populace. The paper stresses the need for a substantial consumer awareness campaign before embarking on any improvement programme.||Peeyush Bajpai,Laveesh Bhandari

In part, these local productive choices and their environmental impact are rooted in global economic forces and markets, seemingly far removed from the backwaters of Goa. Although there are many interrelated dimensions of this transformation, the author focuses on the growing importance of backwater pisciculture at the expense of agriculture and the fragile khazan environment.||Janet Ahner Rubinoff

The first paper presented a detailed evaluation of the secondary data available on irrigation in West Bengal. This paper uses these data to identify certain features of irrigation development in the state. After presenting an overview of the pattern of irrigation in the state, the author analyses the growth of irrigation from groundwater and canals and the changes in irrigation from ponds and river lift-irrigation schemes. Finally, inter-district variations in the growth of irrigated area are discussed.

New production and processing methods driven by biotechnology (genetically modified organisms (GMOs), hormones and other growth promoters) affect food safety. Are alternative more sustainable patterns of food production and consumption feasible? The paper examines some consumer initiatives in Asia and in the UK to examine how the consumer as a 'market force' can proactively influence the food industry, thereby making sustainable practices the norm rather than the exception. It also looks at the significance of empowering women, as consumers, with awareness and education on food safety, nutrition and its dependence on sustainable practices to exert a 'pull' on the market. Finally the paper discusses a multi-pronged approach involving, besides consumer pressure, policy changes, regulatory efforts and economic instruments to steer food production and consumption in a more sustainable direction.||Radha Gopalan

The author examines the pattern of inter-disciplinary relations that is revealed in these examples, focusing on issues of differential inter-disciplinary prestige, inter-disciplinary borrowing, and the maturation cycles of inter-disciplinary fields. It conclude; with an examination, through parodies of CBA, of how emotional responses to boundary-crossing have led towards a partial and flawed vision of CBA and highlights the need to simultaneously both use and problematise CBA.||Michael R.

Joint Forest Management (JFM) is restricted to management of forests as providers of forest and non-timber forest products. This paper investigates in detail the extensive indigenous knowledge of such local ecological services among a forest community. It argues that local ecological services are the missing link in designing plans for successful decentralisation and sustainable management of forests. Enlisting such local knowledge, as is done in this paper, is the first step to incorporating it in the management of forests.||Sanjay Kumar

It argues that in order to internalise the external costs of such water supply, there should be a locally embedded system of forest management. It further argues that pricing of these external ecosystem products, like water, is needed to enable local communities to balance the benefits from their sale against costs and other benefits.||Yu Xiaogang

It is through the fall in the supply of local environmental services, like nutrient recycling and soil formation, that forest communities bear the external costs that are not included in the price of timber and other forest products. Local environmental services are taken into account in forest management decisions by local communities, but not by external agents, like forest departments, and form a basis for setting up local forest management systems. In arguing for the establishment of forest communities' property rights over forests, the paper supports the establishment of markets for regional and global environmental services provided by forests.||Dev Nathan,Govind Kelkar

Yet, in Tailism and the Dialectic, Georg Lukács - perhaps the most influential figure in Western Marxism - strongly endorses the existence of an objective dialectic in nature. A close examination of Lukács's main writings on science shows, however, that he still in effect denied the possibility of applying dialectical method to nature. This paradox is bound up with a dualistic conception of natural and social science with distinctly adverse implications for the development of an ecological Marxism.||Paul Burkett
