Their role continued to be significant as long as technology remained labour-intensive and collieries were small and surface-bound. The expansion of the industry and increasing mechanisation saw a decline in women's participation. This paper based on research in the Raniganj coalbelt in eastern India describes how the work of resource extraction becomes gendered, the growing marginalisation of women, and their increasing alienation from access to environmental resources and their transformation into illegitimate and invisible beings.||Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt

The paper investigates local people's knowledge of forest-based ecological services, including water regulation and nutrient recycling, and gender differences in the local knowledge of these services. The paper notes that the Hani have maintained the forest condition quite irrespective of its tenurial status. The reluctance to 'eat the state forest' is attributed to the local understanding that the forests comprise 'critical natural capital' on which their very survival depends.||Wang Qinghua

Reorienting water resources research in the current changed context of declining foreign aid and increasing social and environmental activism means dealing less with issues of technology per se and more with adoption and adaptation of technology, which becomes more of a social or institutional issue. This essay tries to examine water rights conflicts in two connected geographical locales of south Asia: Bihar and Nepal. Because both areas are part of the Ganga basin, the future of Nepal and Bihar are inextricably linked as far as development, in particular of water resources is concerned. The challenges of water management in the Himalaya-Ganga in the decades ahead will depend, to a large extent, on the kind of statesmanship available to balance all three institutional solidarities - regulatory bureaucracy, innovative market and cautionary activism. The alternative is conflict where no one gets anything except lawsuits, demonstrations, delays, intractable disputes, and even violence.||Dipak Gyawali

In part, these local productive choices and their environmental impact are rooted in global economic forces and markets, seemingly far removed from the backwaters of Goa. Although there are many interrelated dimensions of this transformation, the author focuses on the growing importance of backwater pisciculture at the expense of agriculture and the fragile khazan environment.||Janet Ahner Rubinoff

New production and processing methods driven by biotechnology (genetically modified organisms (GMOs), hormones and other growth promoters) affect food safety. Are alternative more sustainable patterns of food production and consumption feasible? The paper examines some consumer initiatives in Asia and in the UK to examine how the consumer as a 'market force' can proactively influence the food industry, thereby making sustainable practices the norm rather than the exception. It also looks at the significance of empowering women, as consumers, with awareness and education on food safety, nutrition and its dependence on sustainable practices to exert a 'pull' on the market. Finally the paper discusses a multi-pronged approach involving, besides consumer pressure, policy changes, regulatory efforts and economic instruments to steer food production and consumption in a more sustainable direction.||Radha Gopalan

The author examines the pattern of inter-disciplinary relations that is revealed in these examples, focusing on issues of differential inter-disciplinary prestige, inter-disciplinary borrowing, and the maturation cycles of inter-disciplinary fields. It conclude; with an examination, through parodies of CBA, of how emotional responses to boundary-crossing have led towards a partial and flawed vision of CBA and highlights the need to simultaneously both use and problematise CBA.||Michael R.

Its exploitation is now taking a sharp and ugly turn with the tribals fighting for their livelihood and homes and against the environmentally damaging industrial development being proposed and the state tacitly endorsing the development plans.||Vidhya Das

Joint Forest Management (JFM) is restricted to management of forests as providers of forest and non-timber forest products. This paper investigates in detail the extensive indigenous knowledge of such local ecological services among a forest community. It argues that local ecological services are the missing link in designing plans for successful decentralisation and sustainable management of forests. Enlisting such local knowledge, as is done in this paper, is the first step to incorporating it in the management of forests.||Sanjay Kumar

The tragedy, entirely a man-made one, could have been averted by a responsive and alert government, sensitive to ecological considerations. Instead, even as little or no effort is made to dredge the river bottom or prevent erosion, distribution of relief after the floods, follows extremely partisan lines.||Nileen Putatunda

It is through the fall in the supply of local environmental services, like nutrient recycling and soil formation, that forest communities bear the external costs that are not included in the price of timber and other forest products. Local environmental services are taken into account in forest management decisions by local communities, but not by external agents, like forest departments, and form a basis for setting up local forest management systems. In arguing for the establishment of forest communities' property rights over forests, the paper supports the establishment of markets for regional and global environmental services provided by forests.||Dev Nathan,Govind Kelkar

Yet, in Tailism and the Dialectic, Georg Lukács - perhaps the most influential figure in Western Marxism - strongly endorses the existence of an objective dialectic in nature. A close examination of Lukács's main writings on science shows, however, that he still in effect denied the possibility of applying dialectical method to nature. This paradox is bound up with a dualistic conception of natural and social science with distinctly adverse implications for the development of an ecological Marxism.||Paul Burkett

Remedial tree felling was conducted under the guise of ecological action, exposing the economic undercurrents. The government investigations conducted mostly by the state forest department were mere cover-ups. Following the central government and Supreme Court directives prohibiting tree felling, the pest attack has declined, falsifying the official speculations of an intensification.||Utkarsh Ghate

This paper unravels the process of this shift away from coal-based power generation and makes an economic comparison of LNG-based generation with its competing options. As a sensitivity analysis based on cost variations of components revealed, in most cases, coal-based generation turned out to be a cheaper option. Though experts have spoken up for LNG's environmental friendly nature, questions still remain even as India's extensive coal reserves remain poorly exploited.||Amol Phadke

Non-market goods including the environment are being subjected to direct commodification or to the introduction of market norms. The appropriate response is to resist the disappearance of proper boundaries between the different spheres. Protection of environments is best served by resistance to the spread of commodity exchange and its norms and defending environmental goals in terms of established ethical, aesthetic, political and scientific standards.||John O'Neill

Following environmental concerns about the Snowy's declining flow, a popular agitation that saw a broad-based participation of experts, politicians and even the layman, finally restored to the Snowy much of its previous flow. The judgment will hopefully set a precedent for similar cases, not merely for Australia, but across the world.||Kuntala Lahiri-Dutt
