Introduction both of systematic arrangements for personal growth at the individual level to free the creative potential in every person and of organisation development at the level of industry, trade union, government, and every important organised sector of the country by using advanced knowledge and technology available to the behavioural sciences, to make India a nation which is far more adaptive and flexible in its response to the changing nature of the environment, are necessary to transform the present degenerate society. The individuals need to be freed from their scrips and new values have to be brought into Indian society and nation to make them dynamic and viable entities.||Gouranga P. Chattopadhyay

Hence a number of diverse factors influence voting decisions. One way to study voting patterns is to relate electoral returns to a maximum number of structural variables which define the political unit. Attitudinal approaches can supplement, but not supplant, such study. For this study, the Metropolitan Council constituencies of the Union Territory of Delhi were chosen as units of observations. The data were drawn from the 1972 election returns, brought out by the Press Information Bureau of the Government of India. The socio-economic data were based on the 1961 Census of India. All the data were subjected to orthogonal factor analysis. The article concludes that the Congress (R) support cuts across ecological frontiers, and that it gets consistent support from the female voters as also from literate voters. But the Jan Sangh gets more support from among the literate sections. Nothing very definite can be said, however, about the vote share of Communists, Socialists, or the Left ideological group, as their scanty presence in Delhi's elections renders any analysis not so meaningful. Lastly, the Right ideological group, as a whole, is a function of the sex factor and the economic factor and some contribution is made to it also by the electoral factor.||Raj Chandidas

Death rates in the Travancore-Cochin area of Kerala had begun to fall from a much earlier period than elsewhere in India. A significant proportion of this fall in death rates was due to reduction in mortality from infectious diseases like plague, cholera and smallpox. The decline in mortality from these infectious diseases may be traced to the various public health measures such as eradication and control of communicable diseases, sanitation, water supply, personal and environmental hygiene, etc, rather than to the extension of the medical care delivery system. The experience of other countries conforms to this hypothesis.||P G K Panikar
