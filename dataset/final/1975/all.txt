All the major tax concessions incorporated in the Budget are designed to encourage investment and will contribute to growth of output in future, depending on the gestation period. None of these incentives is designed to induce current output.||N. J. Jhaveri

13/12/1975- ||special articles||40740154||Inter-State Tax Effort||Though the Sixth Finance Commission has come out against the use of tax-effort as a criterion for determining the devolution of statutory transfers from the Centre to the states, the relevance of the taxeffort criterion cannot easily be dismissed, especially if importance is attached to the objective of equitable distribution of the overall burden of taxation. Operationally also to ignore inter-state differences in tax-effort is to put a premium on low tax-effort and to promote laxity in tax-effort on the part of the states. To the extent that the Finance Commission's award ignores tax-effort, there is, therefore, even greater need for the Planning Commission to give weightage to this criterion in its distribution of Central transfer. This article examines the various measures of tax-effort with a view to arriving at a reliable indicator of comparative tax-effort by the different states.||K N Reddy
1/2/1975- ||limits of partial controls||4536854||Smuggling, Exchange Controls and Indian Economy||The failure of the government's recent drive to curb smuggling is illustrative of the self-defeating nature of controls in a partially planned economy. This paper argues that smuggling, like other devices to evade government controls, is inherent in the structure of a mixed economy. Attempts to control such evasion through a manipulation of the instruments open to the State in a mixed economy are not likely to meet with much success unless the reforms are extensive enough to change the character of the State itself. The possibilities of combating evasion of controls by other measures which bring the system nearer a 'market solution' too are extremely limited. In the context of smuggling, such measures would include an attempt to reduce the profitability of smuggling by removing the price differential between the black and the official markets. This could be tried through a relaxation of import restrictions or through a devaluation. The conclusions of this paper on the negative effects of such measures to check the evasion of controls are likely to disappoint not only those who are optimistic about the workability of a mixed economy but also those who would like to see the removal of controls from the system.||Sunanda Sen

6/12/1975- ||special articles||40740294||Shipping and Developing Countries||By far the greater part of active world shipping is owned by the developed nations, either directly or through "flags of convenience". Ship-building capacity is also located overwhelmingly in the developed nations. These countries exert pressure against expansion of nationally-owned merchant marines of the underdeveloped nations, as receipts from freight and insurance form an important part of their "invisibles" earnings. Shipping Conferences based in the developed countries fully exploit this situation, to the underdeveloped countries' disadvantage. This article argues that by acquiring ships (and altering them suitably where necessary) at appropriate times in the trade-freight rates-laid up shipping cycle, it may be possible for the underdeveloped countries to increase their merchant marine tonnages. If this is co-ordinated further with measures like regional shipping pools, establishment of intra-regional and inter-regional trade complementarities and shippers' councils, it may be possible to make a dent in the oligopolistic position of Shipping Conferences which today are not under any sort of control.||Badal Roy

This involves asking what do we mean by effectiveness. The second question is what kind of conditions in terms of the communicators and the audience obtain at present in our world of audio-visual communication for making such effective programmes. The third, and most crucial, question is how do we build this effectiveness into our programmes. It is in this area of programme building that one needs expertise of various kinds of come together, opinions and experience of people with various backgrounds to be shared. Our research strategy would depend directly upon how we tackle these three questions. The purpose of this paper is to initiate discussion on some of the problems involved in each one of these three areas and in their interrelationship.||Pramod Kale

Their position was one of subordination but importance in the regional assemblies which marked the medieval period from the eleventh to the thirteenth century. With the increasing urbanisation which started with the symptomatic temple-building of the eleventh century and reached its height during the Vijayanagar period they came to occupy a place of considerable importance in these urban areas. Their affiliations with temples and the united character of their guilds were important factors in the enhancement of their influence along with the prosperity gained through new economic opportunities. The ascendancy to this new position along with the other artisan and merchant groups which had reaped a rich harvest in the new urban areas was of such significance that is is suggested that the dual divisions of society so important later on may have reached full maturation at this time.||Richard A.

To assess the potential of the Unidad Popular within the structural context of the Chilean political economy and the logic of its development at the time of Allende's victory, we have to come to grips with questions relating to the nature of bourgeois ideology and the likely ways in which the bourgeoisie would react in concrete circumstances where socialist parties enter government by playing according to the bourgeois political rules of the game, but, having come to power initiate policies which directly challenge the bourgeoisie's control of the economy which lies at the root of their control of the political and state structure. This inevitably leads to questions relating to whether, under any conditions, parliamentary socialism can constitute a viable method or even a preliminary step in the process of reordering and restructuring society in a revolutionary direction.||T.

This is followed by an analysis of Nehru's ideas on the dynamics of population, land and capital - the ultimate factors in economic progress. The next two sections deal with education and democratic planning, the two instruments on which Nehru banked for achieving the transformation. Finally, a short critique is developed of Nehru's economic model and certain basic questions have been posed which must be answered before any judgment can be attempted on the relevance of that model for the development of the country.||H.

In the Plan too much attention has been given to population redistribution, and the problem of traffic and the associated allocation of land under "Roads and Streets" has been by and large neglected. The objectives of land-use plans are essentially long-range in nature. That being so, land-use plans are more effective for new peripheral development. Plans for already built-up areas are more difficult to implement. Coping with externalities is of particular concern to land-use regulation. It Is important to find institutional devices by which the impact of externalities will be compensated for. This is usually done by zoning ordinances. But zoning regulations cannot be retractive: a land-use pattern existing prior to the enactment of the regulation cannot be changed. If the desired land-use patterns are to be attained and the "non-conforming uses" relocated, we will need a set of efficient public policies to supplement the plan to help the transition to the future.||Biswajit Banerjee

The author then goes back to the 1961 Census to analyse women's participation in work as secondary activity to their household domestic duties. The maior findings of the paper are : (i) going by the 1971 Census definition of workers, which excludes all secondary work participation, while not even one out of every five working men is an agricultural labourer, almost half of the working women are engaged as agricultural labourers; (ii) of the women who participate in work only as secondary activity, almost nine out of every ten are engaged in cultivation with much of the rest accounted for by other work, which includes household industry; (iii) the proportion of women engaged in work as secondary activity is as high as that of women engaged in work as main activity; (iv) a sort of regional pattern can be observed in the participation in work as main activity and there too, for cultivation and agricultural labour as compared to other work; (v) a movement from north to south and from east to west seems to be accompanied by higher female participation, with exceptions like Himachal Pradesh and Kerala; and (vi) the much-posited relationship between concentration of small holdings and more intensive cuivation is not borne out insofar as it refers to the inter-state comparison of the employment of women as cultivators, whether as main or secondary activity.||Leela Gulati

Hence the conceptual framework and the reading material for Indian political science is being provided by the American scholars. The Indian student is at the receiving end of this academic colonialism. Why do we teach political science? The purpose of teaching political science is to expose the student to the realities of the political system. Thus the major area of interest of political science is coterminus with the national reality in the age of nation-states. How can this goal be achieved by teaching concepts based on values of an imperialist country? How can books written with the American perspective perform the task of exposing an Indian student to India's political reality?||C. P. Bhambhri

11/1/1975- ||special articles||4536796||Films and Political Consciousness in Tamil Nadu||The film in South India has been a major hicle of the Dravidian movement, and its effect and penetration may be measured in the spectacular rise of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and in its landslide victory in Tamil Nadu in the 1967 election. The early Tamil films were largely 'mythologicals', but they were quickly infused with a distinctly Dravidian content. Writers and actors who had matured in the touring dramatic companies associated with E V Ramaswamy Naicker's Self-Respect Movement came to dominate the Tamil screen. From the 'guerilla theatre' of Tamil nationalism, they brought anti-northern, anti Brahmin themes. Their Tamil was purged of Sanskritic elements in assertion of Dravidian self respect; the golden age of the Tamil kingdoms was resurrected on celluloid. This article presents some of the results of a survey conducted in 1969, as part of a study of film and society in Tamil Nadu. The survey covered 500 urban respondents in Madras city and 500 rural respondents from a random sample of households in nine villages in North Arcot, South Arcot and Tanjavur districts.||Robert L.

There are undoubtedly effects which would tend to reduce savings, but there is sufficient evidence that the aggregate effect of all determinants would be positive - at least on an a priori basis. Even more importantly, index-linking may have an impact upon the investment climate of the country. Not only would savers find 'inflation proof' assets to invest in, but these assets would be used to finance projects with higher rates of return than earlier. Moreover, such productive investments would now be considerably more attractive than conspicuous consumption or investments in consumer durables. These effects which lead to a marked improvement in efficiency is as important as an increase in the capital stock for sustained economic development.||Pronab Sen

1/8/1975- ||roots of underdevelopment||4537329||India and the Colonial Mode of Production||The Indian debate on the mode of production revolves around the question whether, in the last 15 or 20 years, there has been a decisive movement in Indian agriculture from a feudal mode of production to a capitalist mode of production. Similar questions have been raised elsewhere. The protagonists in the Indian debate have looked at European (including Russian) historical parallels and theoretical propositions that have been advanced in those contexts; there is, however, a surprising omission of any reference to the Chinese experience or theoretical contributions. A more serious criticism could be that, by focusing on the agrarian economy, the debate conceptualises 'mode of production' too narrowly-although it must be said that, on specific issues, the wider contexts of the developments in agriculture and ome of the implications arising therefrom are considered. Neither the concept or 'feudalism' in India (during the period of direct colonial domination) nor the contemporary phenomenon of rural 'capitalism', it is argued here, can be grasped theoretically in all its implications except specifically in the context of the worldwide structure of imperialism into which it is articulated. A consideration of this fact leads towards onception of a colonial mode of production and the structural specificity that distinguishes it from both feudalism and capitalism in the metropolis.||Hamza Alavi

The author then goes on to ask if it is possible to draw any conclusion, again particularly for the oil importaing developing countries on the basis of the experience of 1974 and comes up with what may well be considered a simple-minded conclusion, namely, that ways and means ought to be found to canalise more of OPEC surpluses away from the rich countries and to the poor countries of the world.||I.

It is based primarily on his activities in Gujarat. In many ways, this earlier, less studied period was Sardar's training ground for his rise to the all-India stage. It covers mostly the period to 1930, but touches also on developments to the end of Vallabhbhai's life. In the later period, though Sardar no, longer made his residence in Gujarat, he continued to supervise its politics. The paper is divided into five sections: (1) personal background; (2) new techniques of political fighting; (3) the building of a machine; (4) professional politics — a new occupation; and (5) new problems of success.||Howard Spodek

The roots of this can be traced to an inequitous and counter-productive structure of property and earning power distorted further by the kind of policy-mix pursued by the government. This note focuses attention on the structural determinants of the current inflation, and projects the need for basic structural changes.||

The Indian corporate sector is not yet consciously inclined towards this goal and hence towards increasing the value of the firm in the theoretical sense. Rather, the Capital structures mostly evolve from ad hoc unco-ordinated responses to exigencies and market forces. This paper tries to approach operationally the task of measuring the cost of capital in the Indian corporate sector.||S K Chakraborty,Abhijit Sen
27/9/1975- ||review of agriculture, september 1975||4537413||Minimum Wages Legislation for Agricultural Labour: A Review||The National Commission on Labour recommended a number of steps to bring about improvements in the procedures of fixation, revision and implementation of minimum wages for agricultural labour. Among the steps recommended by the Commission are: (1) A periodic revision of minimum wages through constitution of tri-partite committees for fixation or revision of minimum wages; (2) Gradual extension of operation of Minimum Wages Acts, beginning with low wage pocket areas to others; (3) Wide publicity for wages fixed under the Acts; (4) Strengthening of field staff engaged in enforcement of minimum wages and involving the village panchayats in the task of implementation, and (5) Provision of such facilities by the state government as are required to encourage trade unions of agricultural labour. Though periodic revisions of minimum wages for agricultural workers are effected, no systematic examination of either the procedures or the modes of implementation is made. This paper is an attempt to fill this lacuna. Its objectives are: (1) to examine the minimum wages currently in force in different states with reference to the market wage rates; (2) to analyse the procedure of fixation of minimum wages, identify the deficiencies and suggest changes; and (3) to examine the existing administrative machinery set up for implementation of minimum wages.||G.

It was further argued that the extent and character of exploitation and its dynamic effects may not be fully grasped if the lease market is studied in isolation; the dominant parties quite often enhance their exploitative hold by linking up several transactions directly. In this note the authors provide further analysis of the data from the Orissa villages to (a) compare different tenurial systems co-existing in the same village, in terms of rents per acre payable to the landlord and gross productivity of land, and (b) provide some evidence to support the argument that variations in rents and productivity are associated with the tenant's economic position as indicated by the size of operational holding.||Krishna Bharadwaj,P.

The social unpopularity of the female child, the woman's low status with low levels of education and employ ability, and the excessive child-bearing ivhich may also be partly due to women's low status, are major contributory factors in the higher rate of mortality among females. These factors result in the comparative neglect of the female's health throughout her life, leading to her higher mortality and deteriorating numbers in relation to males.||Kumudini Dandekar

Yet the consumption-inducing effect of profit taxation is seldom considered serious enough to outweigh its merits as an instrument of raising revenue. It is argued here that if wasteful business expenditure is to be curbed, radical change is needed in the base of business taxation, particularly in the case of companies. Such a change will also remove the premum which taxation of net profits puts an inefficiency. The authors attempt to assess the dimensions of wasteful personal and business spending and show how attempts made so far to curb such spending have not gone far in meeting the problem. The authors urge that only a change in the corporate tax base from net profit to business expenditure can remove the present strong tendency towards waste and inefficiency in the corporate sector.||I.

Although the usefulness of organic matter in crop production is well recognised, this has for long been a controversial issue in India. It is feared in some quarters that most of the organic manure added to the soil gets oxidised due to the prevailing tropical temperature and that hardly any benefit is obtained from it. In fact, experiments carried out in the agriculturally advanced countries, including those in the temperate regions, as well as some experiments in India have proved beyond doubt that the application of organic manure in combination with inorganic fertilisers helps not only to increase crop production but also to maintain soil productivity.||S.

Hence a number of diverse factors influence voting decisions. One way to study voting patterns is to relate electoral returns to a maximum number of structural variables which define the political unit. Attitudinal approaches can supplement, but not supplant, such study. For this study, the Metropolitan Council constituencies of the Union Territory of Delhi were chosen as units of observations. The data were drawn from the 1972 election returns, brought out by the Press Information Bureau of the Government of India. The socio-economic data were based on the 1961 Census of India. All the data were subjected to orthogonal factor analysis. The article concludes that the Congress (R) support cuts across ecological frontiers, and that it gets consistent support from the female voters as also from literate voters. But the Jan Sangh gets more support from among the literate sections. Nothing very definite can be said, however, about the vote share of Communists, Socialists, or the Left ideological group, as their scanty presence in Delhi's elections renders any analysis not so meaningful. Lastly, the Right ideological group, as a whole, is a function of the sex factor and the economic factor and some contribution is made to it also by the electoral factor.||Raj Chandidas

This bibliographical essay assumes that it is possible to measure the surplus in India on the basis of currently available material. This optimism has sometimes meant press-ganging weak data to fulfil a task they are not equal to. Nevertheless, however inaccurate or otherwise misleading the figures, they are no worse than the ones used by planning and policy-making bodies in the country. There is no reason therefore to suspend the attempt to measure the surplus until the data improve. Even inaccurate estimates of certain key components of the surplus could be of great importance in assessing the rapidity and direction (if any) of the development of Indian capitalism.||Dennis Childs,Michael Kidron

The main purpose of this study of hisan unrest in Uttar Pradcsk during the period 1920-22 is to examine the major socio-economic conditions responsible for the kisan discontent. This will help us to understand more clearly the behavi oural reality of the politics of nationalism. What circumstances, from within and outside, stimulated the kisans to rebel against the political and economic system? What were the relations between the Congress leaders and kisans? How did the Congress leadership visualise the role of kisatis in the national movement, and deal with their problems? The answers to these questions were worked out in a complex interplay of the forces of nationalism, socialism and conservatism during this brief, but profoundly significant, epoch in Indian national history.||Govind S Kelkar

We have divided the paper into four sections. Section I provides the background information on the development of minor irrigation in India in the last two'decades. This enables us to present, in the next section, a set technical alternatives which can be considered for utilising groundwater. Section III gives the methodology used in evaluating these options, while Section IV presents some results. Appendix A gives a comprehensive analysis of the various components of capital costs and operating costs along with the data sources.||Ramesh Bhatia,Meera Mehta

1/2/1975- ||the political structure||4536862||Structure of Indian Radicalism||The rulers who prided themselves on the "democratic experiment" of the Indian polity from an assured position of power and authority are now finding it difficult to accept the results of this experiment. Their style and sensibilities, suited to resolving inter-elite differences, seem to be failing them now that they are faced with what they call 'politics of populism' or 'radicalisation of politics'. The widening of the gap between the ruling elite and the masses has resulted in tension between the forms of liberal democracy and the radical aspirations of the people. Theoretically, there should be no such tension, for democratic institutions are meant to provide the mechanisms of political decision-making through which popular demands get translated into government policies. But it is precisely such a simplistic view of democracy which prevents a proper understanding of the forces involved in the present situation. It ignores class-based conflicts of interest which come into the open in the process of democratisation. It is equally simplistic to view this contradiction as one forcing a choice between maintaining the democratic institutions and fulfilling the radical aspirations. The question is not whether to maintain democratic institutions or to fulfil radical aspirations but how to institutionalise the radical aspirations that have been released. This article explores empirically, in this context, the nature and extent of radical orientation of the Indian public. The data are drawn from a nation-wide survey conducted immediately after the 1971 elections.||D. L. Sheth

Sometimes the changes are brought about by the positive force of the agrarian movement itself. In some other situations, the changes are the result of the influence of classes which are not directly involved in the movement. In yet other conditions, the changes are due to the response of the ruling classes in the form of a combination of repression and reform. The present study attempts to analyse the impact of agrarian unrest in some parts of Bihar. The areas studied are Musahari in Muzaffarpur district, Turkaulia in Champaran district and Tundi in Dhanbad district.||Pradhan H. Prasad

The implication which farmers and others seem to derive from this approach is that unless they include all parts of the input package at their 'recommended' levels, HYV technology will not be of any benefit. This paper compares the likely benefits from the adoption of three different packages of technology, using extensive crop-fertiliser response data f roma number of sources, most of which are derived from experiments conducted in the farmers' fields. On the basis of the admittedly limited evidence presented here, there would seem to be a case for closer examination of the current emphasis in research and extension on the ' package of practices' approach. If tne aim is increased levels of adoption of new technologies in agriculture, the analysis here suggests that parts of the package can have a significant contribution to make.||James G Ryan,K V Subrahmanyam

The Committee's approach to its task, the author feels, was ahistoric, aprioristic and aphoristic.

The findings of this study are that, the so-called Green Revolution notwithstanding, there has been a tendency towards a slowing down of the growth rate in agriculture, though a constant rate of agricultural growth seems equally well suggested. In industry, however, there has been a diminishing rate of growth between 1951 and 1974.||Amal Krishna Dey

31/5/1975- ||review of management, may 1975||4537154||Monitoring Import of Technology into India||A large portion of modern technology import into India has been on behalf of government-mainly in the defence and other basic industries. While the dvanced countries-whether of West or Eastern Europe-have supplied such technology ostensibly to support India's effort to industrialise, in fact, the motivations of these countries can be traced to their larger strategy of gaining influence in the developing countries. Private foreign parties, on the other hand, have been motivated to exploit the vast market of India for profit. By exporting technology to India they have been able to penetrate the otherwise protected market of this country. Overall, in the last two decades, India has imported technology heavily. Though it has thus acquired a sufficient technological base to become self-reliant, this has not been reflected in a lower rate of technology import. Indeed, in a free enterprise economy and in country where a section of the population has enough money to demand a vast range of items of affluent consumption, there are pressures generated for repetitive technology import as well as for its import into fields which by no means contribute to the welfare of the people. This paper examines the trends in technology imports since Independence, and traces ways in which these have influenced the direction and pattern of Indian economic development.||Sumitra Chishti

10/5/1975- ||special articles||4537104||Social Inequalities and Development in India||Efforts made in India to advance economic development and reduce inequalities, while yielding small gains in economic growth have resulted in a further increase in inequalities. Knowledge about inequalities so far contributes mainly to a description of the phenomenon and very little to its explanation. An attempt is made here at explaining some aspect of the phenomenon. Gaining insight from a case study of a growing industrial community, a theoretical framework has been developed, which is based on the major generalisation that inequalities in India are dependent upon the social structure. The theoretical framework is validated by showing its usefulness in explaining consistently some of the known facts about socio-economic change and development which have hitherto been found inconsistent with prevailing notions, and in uncovering some little known facts. It explains why, contrary to expectations, more disadvantaged sections in the rural areas are less prone to migrate to the urban areas, and why the migrants to cities are better adjusted economically as compared to the residents. An important hypothesis deduced from the theoretical framework - that the representation of scheduled castes population in urban communities is negatively related to the degree of their occupational complexity - does in fact find support from the available information.||Victor S.

The story of two farmers' agitations-one of cotton-growers of Bhatinda district and the other of tubewell-owners in Gurdaspur district-is narrated in parts III and IV, respectively. Finally, in part V, some tentative conclusions are drawn from the farmers' agitation primarily in Gurdaspur district. It is suggested that farmers' agitations, as such, independently of an understanding of the existing class conflicts and divorced from any idea of a strategy will necessarily peter out and prove inffective.||Nirmal Azad

10/5/1975- ||special articles||4537103||Tackling the Edible Oil Famine||A shortage of edible and fatty oils of near-famine proportions is upon us. Availability of edible oil in 1972-73 was at an all-time low of 2.3 kg annually per head. This is well below even the normal consumption demand, and barely a fifth of the quantity required for adequate nutrition. A sudden increase in world prices since 1972 has made edible oil imports even less feasible. Increase in output of oilseeds in the last two decades has been much less through higher productivity than through area increase, to which there is a limit. An active plan to meet oil shortages is presented in this paper. It envisages a larger allocation for research in oilseeds, particularly for extension activities, which are the main lecunae at present. Seed multiplication and distribution systems in particular require special attention if oilseed availability is to increase. Creation was proposed of a National Oilseeds Development Council or Board as an apex planning body, as well as of a separate research organisation or national grid of advanced research centres devoted to oilseed crops. Groundnut dominates the Indian output of oils, and is a major factor in low total oil production. Being a cross-pollinated crop, genetic manipulation is limited. For this and other reasons, diversification of oil crops is called for. Groundnut itself could best b raised as a summer irrigated crop. Of the many other oilseed candidates, sunflower, safflower and castor have high potential. New areas in eastern India can be sown to them. In traditional areas, crop rotation systems must include oilseeds, for which purpose a variety of traditional and new crops are available. Technology can add to the oil pool. Examples are the processing of cottonseed for its oil, the collection, stabilisation and extraction of oil from rice bran, and the collection, refining and utilisation of oils from forest and roadside trees. Specific steps are required in each of these areas. India produces several high-priced oils in surplus, like linseed and castor, which are in world demand. A barter system could enable import of low-priced oils needed in India, like tallow and palm oil, by export of a smaller quantity of these surplus oils, without any foreign exchange changing hands. Highvalue oilseed products could also be traded similarly for oils. Certain other measures will also stimulate oil production: ban on the use of whole cottonseed as cattlefeed, provision of credit to farmers for agricultural inputs, and grant of advances to entrepreneurs to organise collection of oilseeds from forest trees.||K.

In this article, the author discusses social legislations and protest movements as sources of social change. But whether-or not the desired goal — realisation of change — will be achieved through legislations or movements, depends on the nature of the stratification, power-structure, and cultural system in a society. The main concern here is to examine the relationship between agrarian legislations and mooements tvith special reference to Kerala. Kerala is a critical case in the Indian context, as radical agrarian legislations were enacted and militant movements initiated, in this state.||T K Oommon

Not much more is, however, known about the terms and conditions prevailing between landowners and tenants. This article presents some of the findings regarding share-cropping arrangements in West Bengal thrown up by a survey into agrarian relations. The findings reveal certain extraordinary constancies and certain equally impressive variabilities. The variability and the constancy together might conform to some rational scheme which could be unravelled in terms of a model. The present paper, however, is concerned only with the facts and figures without trying to explain them in terms of a model.||Ashok Rudra

Or is this revival a result of the operation of some other processes? To what extent have the various processes, jointly or separately, changed the party system? What further changes are they likely to bring about in its mechanics and/or its format in the foreseeable future? To answer these questions we need a framework with relevant concepts and categories for identifying the various changes that have occurred or are occurring and for inferring the directions in which the party system is moving under their cumulative impact. This paper examines some aspects of party competition in Madhya Pradesh by evaluating the performance of parties across four elections to the state assembly since 1956. The questions asked are: (1) How did the various parties and groups fare in the four elections and how similar or different was their performance? (2) What was the extent of reciprocity in the fluctuations of party fortunes? (3) What was the nature of the relationship between the vote and seat shares of parties? (4) Finally, how should these relationships be interpreted in assessing a party's position in the overall matrix of party competition?||Bashiruddin Ahmed,V. B. Singh

This article examines the impact of these changes on the banks' earnings and costs. The trend in expenses, earnings and profits might suggest that economies of scale have not been operating in the commercial banking industry. However, while the entry into new areas, in the geographic as well as the functional sense, has definitely weakened the internal structure of the industry, the total result, the author argues, has not been the disaster that it has sometimes been made out to be.||Meenakshi Tyagarajan

The externalities can, however, be internalised if a public agency undertakes to supply groundwater. Public tubewells, wherever feasible, are not only the best means for managing groundwater resources efficiently, but are also the only way to overcome the problem of lack of utilisation of groundwater resources in certain areas afflicted by fragmented, tenanted, small holdings.||B.

Information on who leases land from whom as well as on the terms and conditions, with possible variations in them, that accompany the leases is crucial for analysing the tenurial question-to understand the functioning of the 'lease market' and the mode of exploitation. The authors have here used illustratively data on these subjects for villages of Crissa. Section 1 of the article sets out in broad terms some relevant features of the authors' approach. In section II, using the information obtained from the villages studied, the authors discuss certain features of leases: who leases from whom, the motivation for and preferences in leasing out as expressed by landlords themselves and the variations in the terms and conditions of leases. The prevalence of a mode of exploitation that operates through a tie-up between land and labour is noted, as is the fact that even within seemingly rigid conventional shares under sharecropping, landlords may be able to extract more (or secure less) depending upon the relative status of the lessor and the lessee. Important differences among the irrigated, unirrigated, cash crop and tribal areas are also considered. In Section III, the authors suggest as explanation for a transition from sharecropping to fixed rent, observed in the villages studied, following the introduction of irrigation and high-yielding paddy.||Krishna Bharadwaj,P.

In order to fulfill the above objectives, the authors' scheme of public distribution envisages: (a) a system of compulsory procurement based on graded producer levy; (b) self reliance, the total volume of procurement from domestic producers being at least equal to the quantity required for public distribution in normal years; (c) equity in the distribution of the burden of procurement; and, (d) procurement at reasonable prices.||I.

Death rates in the Travancore-Cochin area of Kerala had begun to fall from a much earlier period than elsewhere in India. A significant proportion of this fall in death rates was due to reduction in mortality from infectious diseases like plague, cholera and smallpox. The decline in mortality from these infectious diseases may be traced to the various public health measures such as eradication and control of communicable diseases, sanitation, water supply, personal and environmental hygiene, etc, rather than to the extension of the medical care delivery system. The experience of other countries conforms to this hypothesis.||P G K Panikar

Moreover, urbanisation and overall development in a region cannot be separated. Thus rational decision-making on urbanisation involves understanding the implications of alternative strategies, both in terms of resources and in terms of the extent to which they achieve different objectives. One plausible way of decion-making is to adopt what may be called a 'systems' approach, consisting of developing a set of analytical tools which enable the decision-makers to take an integrated view of the urbanisation process and to understand the implications of alternative strategies in terms of the various interacting elements in the system.||D.

Could not have alternative domestic policies drastically reduced, if not eliminated, imports of foodgrains in the past? In the light of estimates of the supply of and demand for cereals in the country, this paper examines to what extent excess consumption by the rich was responsible for the massive imports. By how much could imports have been reduced if the maximum cereal consumption by the rich were limited to the per capita norm?||N. K. Chandra

The relations between classes, between those who labour and the few who appropriate, and the specific form it takes, can only be understood if we begin with social production, itself a historically determined process. The structures of the Ugandan economy have their origin in the colonial period. The history of colonialism is the history of the creation of the underdeveloped economy. It is also the history of the formation and the development of the appropriating classes that set the tone of politics after independence.||Mahmood Mamdani

A great deal of concern is expressed and a variety of steps are undertaken when the country is faced with scarcity. But as soon as conditions become slightly more favourable, all the brave words are forgotten and once again we relapse into an atmosphere of euphoria. It is assumed by the authors of this note that the need for proper management of available foodgrains in the country is an abiding need and the measures to be initiated to cope with the problems are of a long-term character. We have to evolve a system which can meet the demands of the situation in a period of scarcity as much as in a period of relative abundance. Against this background, in section one of this paper, we propose to discuss the basic features of the food problem in our country and to set out the objectives of food policy in that context. Section two discusses the rationale of a national food budget to fulfil the objectives of food policy. Section three gives an illustration of a national food budget for the current year (1975) and explains how such a budget can be constructed. In the last section we summarise the steps involved in building a national food policy for the coming years.||V. S. Vyas,S. C. Bandyopadhyay

1/8/1975- ||agrarian modes||4537334||Tenancy Reform in India||Recent years have witnessed a revival of public interest in land reform. This renewed interest is, however, largely confined to the question of ceiling on agricultural holdings. In a predominantly agrarian economy, the salient features of which are a very high man-land ratio, unequal distribution of holdings, scarcity of capital, and slow growth of non-farm employment, the relevance of a policy of radical redistribution of land is obvious. A well-conceived ceiling law, efficiently and honestly implemented, will, no doubt, remove some of the glaring inequalities in our agrarian structure and foster agricultural growth. While efforts should continue towards the streamlining and better implementation of ceiling laws, it will be unfortunate if the preoccupation with the ceiling question leads to the neglect of other important aspects of land reform. One fruitful field where resolute action can yield quick results is tenancy reform. Most of the tenancies being oral and informal, it is very difficult to make an accurate estimate of the incidence of tenancy. The 1961 Census revealed that about one-quarter of the cultivated land in the country was under tenancy, open or concealed. In all probability, even now, about one-fifth of the land is under tenancy. And, in certain regions the incidence of tenancy may be as high as 40 per cent. Even after two decades of tenancy reform, the position of tenants-particularly of share croppers-continues to be precarious in several parts of the country. Insecure tenures have not merely resulted in the perpetuation of social and economic injustice; they have also turned out to be formidable stumbling blocks in the path of the modernisation of Indian agriculture. High priority should, therefore, be given to the plugging of loopholes in the existing tenancy laws and the better implementation of enacted laws. An attempt will be made in this paper to Review policy, legislation, and implementation. Some leading policy issues will also be dealt with briefly.||P. S. Appu

25/1/1975- ||special articles||4536837||Social Development and a Strategy for Urbanisation: Absence of a Positive Approach to Urbanisation||The population living in urban units with populations larger than 20,000 will double in next 20 years, even assuming that the proportion of the urban population to the total population of the country does not increase very steeply. The chances are that the percentage of the urban population itself may show a substantial rise. Today 83 per cent of India's urban population, i e, approximately 90 million people, live in habitats of 20,000 or more population. This number may double in the next 20 years. The doubling may result partly as a result of continued townward migration of sections of the rural population and partly as a result of the natural increase of the population already resident in the urban areas. The likelihood is that as the proportion of increase due to urban fertility rates decreases, the proportion due to migration will increase. If the Indian polity is not to totter under the strains generated by urban unrest, a more positive attitude to the process of urbanisation and its role in the developmental strategy is essential. This will have to be reflected in certain overall policy decisions relating to the goals, the extent, the distribution and the social quality of the process of urbanisation. This paper seeks to spell out some of the issues and alternatives that may need consideration in defining an urbanisation policy in the context of social development.||M. S. Gore

The need arises out of the dissatisfaction with aggregate data at the national or regional level which conceal important intra-national or intra-regional variations and underplay the complexity of relationships among a multitude of social, economic and political factors. In the case of India, there is no shortage of such micro-level studies, many of which, given the historical continuity of the village as the primary political and administrative unit in the country, have been conducted at the village level. The problem in the Indian context is of lack of research interest in generalising the experiences of villages in different parts of the country. The present study, based on data from 126 village studies, is an attempt to fill this gap in research. In particular, the paper seeks to develop a simplified typology of village socio-economic systems based on a small study of key variables, and then to examine how far this typology helps to provide a dynamic theory of village job situations under the given socio-political set-up in India. Section II of the paper introduces the sample of villages under investigation, and Section III applies techniques of principal component and discriminant analysis in identifying three mutually exclusive village types. In Section IV is examined the significance of this classification for different groups of variables, and Section V analyses the implications of this typology for a dynamic theory of village job situations.||Biplab Dasgupta

This paper has four sections. In the first section, we make the point that personnel policies, such as they are in our commercial banks, would need to be clearly delineated in order to improve managerial effectiveness. In the second section, we comment on the present status of the personnel function in banks with special reference to the changing role of personnel specialist in today's environment. Some important components of a personnel policy in a bank are discussed in the third section - mainly in a social perspective - bringing into focus a number of relevant issues on which the bank managements have to take a conscious stand in order to help formulate such a corporate policy. In the final section of the paper, we propose some solutions to facilitate the evolutio of personnel policies.||Tushar K. Das

A striking feature of the pump industry is the large number of small-scale enterpises, in and around Coimbatore, manufacturing centrifugal pumps and eleztnc motors, ana accounting for a large share of the production of the entire country. A study of this small-scale industry is of great interest as this se tor contributes to both the industrial and the agricultural development of India. This study is divided into three parts : (1) Grçwth of the small-scale piimps industry in Coimbatore; present importance and economic structure of this sector. (2) Marketing of the pumps produced by the industry and demand for pumps. (3) Use of power-driven pumps in agriculture with special reference to Tamil Nadu and the impact on agriculture.||Michel Cartillier

The demand for and supply of different staple length groups of cotton are also expected to align by 1980. The requirements of long staple and short staple cottons are expected to be met in full. However, in the medium staple group, a gap of about 1.5 lakh bales might persist. The new quick and high-yielding hybrids like CPH-2 and CPH-4, if released early, will help bridge this gap.||S. B. P.

An active process of industrialisation must be marked at least by systematic increases in two ratios: the ratio of industrial output to total national income and the ratio of the working force employed in secondary industry to the working force available for employment. There are reasons to believe that, over most of the nineteenth century, the latter ratio recorded a fall. The trend was not reversed even during the twentieth century, but the rate of fall was halted because of the very smallness of the ratio of industrial employment to total labour force. Although the data for the post-Independence period have not yet been fully worked up to date, it is possible that a rise in both the ratios occurred upto 1964 or 1965. However, they have again recorded a fall since the middle 1960s and do not as yet show any signs of increasing.||A. K. Bagchi

It has been argued tliat administrators' lack of understanding of i he true nature of the distress caused by drought or famine is responsibly for these deficiencies.

25/1/1975- ||special articles||4536839||Distribution of Income among Tax-Payers||Income-tax payers account for only a tiny proportion of 'income units' in the country. In general, they represent the higher income classes. As such, any change in their overall share, or in the distribution of that share among themselves, is economically significant. This note attempts, in the main, to trace for the last two decades (a) the changes in distribution of income among tax-payers, and (b) the respective shares of income of tax-payers and non tax-payers. In doing so, the note keeps in view the various biases in income-tax statistics resulting from the various exemptions, deductions, and rebates allowed to assessees who fall under the income-tax net, as well as those that result from the large-scale tax evasion.||Sreelekha Basu

The role and the responsibility of management vary according to the cultural and political context in which management functions. The two features of Indian culture and society which are crucial in this context are hierarchy and the overall rural character of society. This paper picks out some of the expressions of these features which are germane to the discussion of management's responsibilities.||M. N. Srinivas

This is a strategy born out of desperation; it also marks the transition from belief in an expanding capital goods sector under the aegis of public ownership to a situation in which the state confines itself to the dignified 'core sector'.||S.

17/5/1975- ||special article||4537122||Personnel Management for Rural Banking||Doubts have been raised from time to time, as to the effectiveness of the 'lead bank' scheme launched by the Reserve Bank to promote the objectives of agricultural growth and greater employment opportunities in rural areas. The specific task assigned to the banks is stated to be that of "surveying the potential for banking development, extending branch banking after identifying growth centres, extending credit facilities after locating viable and potentially viable proposals, and mobilising deposits out of rising levels of income". Representatives of government and banking organisations and experts have acknowledged the unsatisfactory record of the banks in performing these tasks. The problem is seen to lie partly in the "lead district" strategy recommended by the Reserve Bank and partly in the implementation of the scheme by the participating banks. One major problem in the implementation of the lead bank scheme concerns the manning of the rural branches with suitable cadres of managers. First, it is necessary for the bank to find sufficient manpower to cope with the demands of rapid branch expansion envisaged in the scheme. Secondly, the people expected to work as branch managers in rural areas need to be adequately trained to handle the problems specific to rural banking - including mobilisation of available funds among the relatively illiterate masses and understanding the financial needs of small farmers and traders. Thirdly, urban-oriented officers, called upon to manage the rural branches, and their families, are likely to face problems of adjustment to the environment of rural areas when they have been accustomed to the professional and social aspirations of the urban life style.||N.

The peasants are being asked to pay the land price determined by them, which is about 80 times the land assessment, though there are cases where it exceeds even 100 times the assessment. The chieftains have the government machinery at their command and the peasants are denied bank loans, taccavi loans and concessions from co-operative societies. This has created unrest among the poor adivasi peasants who are unable to pay the land prices fixed by the mamlatdars.||S. D. Kulkarni

Each is of continental size, with an enormous population; each entered the post-War era of development as a predominantly agrarian society, with an extremely low level of per capita output and correspondingly widespread poverty. Similar in initial economic conditions, China and India have pursued their paths of development under strikingly different political conditions: China with its own brand of revolutionary socialism, India with a Western-style bourgeois democracy. Consequently, the two countries have come to be seen as representative of their respective political systems and that their relative progress has been taken to indicate the possibilities and constraints under each of their respective systems. Any comprehensive evaluation of the development of China and India would have to encompass a wide variety of relevant development objectives, many of them non-economic in nature - for example, a primary Maoist objective has been "the making of Communist man". The extent to which China and India have succeeded in attaining their professed non-economic objectives, is crucial in an assessment of their overall development experiences. However, in view of the conceptual and empirical difficulties involved in analysing China's and India's success in meeting non-economic development objectives, this paper will necessarily be confined to an examination of development performance in the economic sphere. Thus it offers a partial - but significant - basis for comparing China's and India's development performance. In Section I of the paper, is discussed the concept of economic development itself and an attempt is made to identify relevant indicators of performance. Three broad objectives of economic development are distinguished. The performance of China and India in each of these three general areas is examined in the subsequent sections. Section II is thus devoted to economic growth, Section III to economic equity, and Section IV to economic self-reliance. Finally, Section V contains a brief summary and conclusion.||Thomas E.

This article is concerned with disparities, not only in productivity but also in per capita production. Wherever possible, the district is treated as the unit of analysis, no further disaggregation being possible for want of data. While making no attempt to identify all the factors which contribute to regional variations in productivity, we shall attempt to isolate the impact of irrigation and cropping pattern, which are particularly important in the context of the spatial effects of the new technology.||N.

The relationship of employment in the organised sector was tested with each of the above variables, individually, using the sample linear regression method. The theoretical framework permits one to relate employment as a function of physical output at the micro level, for a few selected industries. However, it does not enable one to relate employment as a function of physical output at the macro level, covering broad sectors of the economy, where interdependence of different sectors also plays an important role. In view of this, the relationship of employment in the organised sector was analysed with respect to the macro-economic variables mentioned above, as these are considered quite important in influencing directly the level of employment at both the aggregate and the sectoral levels.||C.

29/11/1975- ||review of management, november 1975||40738387||Development Banking: Top Management Tasks and Structure||What is the emerging social function of a development bank in a dynamic social setting? The charter of a development bank can never define the social function once and for all. It is the task of top management to find out the specific implications of this function in the light of changing socioeconomic reality. The top management thus needs to have a precise knowledge of the different elements of the socioeconomic structure in its dynamic setting. Mere knowledge cannot suffice; top management has to evolve organic links with the decision-making vrocess in the institutions which have an impact on its work, so that its functioning is integrated with that of related institutions. Top management as a function sui generis is discussed in Section I, while the top management tasks and structure as they relate to development banking are indicated in Section II. Communication and information systems as related to the top management task of effective decision-making are discussed in Section III. The organisation principles and designs relevant for different tasks and functions are dealt with in Section IV, Section V deals with the central problem of top management — the problem of motivating the organisation members to seek self-fulfilment in progressively improving the performance of the organisation.||V V Bhatt

(ii) The need for an enhanced role for purchasing and purchasing analysis and research. (iii) The need for a greater interest by top company managers in corporate liquidity and inventory levels. (iv) The need for product development and marketing research to adjust to sharply changed conditions in the markets for consumer products and in the import potential of key markets. Overall, the paper emphasises the need for a hard analysis of short-term changes in the market place and economic environment from 1972 to 1974, the need for a longer-term examination of the company and its product position over the period 1976-1980 and, finally, for a speeding up of corporate raw material price and cost forecasting to equip companies with the ability to get information for key costing, pricing and marketing decisions in a short time.||Angus Hone

1/2/1975- ||food and famine||4536860||Needed: A New Famine Policy||The objective of famine policy should not be to preserve the stock of assets or even the level of income. The 'trigger' should respond only when consumption falls below some given level of calorie intake. If a minimum consumption level is set as the index of scarcity to which it is appropriate to respond in an emergency fashion, it is obvious that the signals which administrators now use lead to the shift of resources into drought-afflicted districts earlier and at higher rates than is economically warranted. The existing signals also increase the probability that resources go not only to the neediest groups but to others as well. The Sixth Finance Commission and the Government of India have accepted the proper principle. Relief expenditure should provide not only work but should simultaneously create facilities that will strengthen the system's productivity. However, the defect of all proposals to date - and the reason it is so difficult to link scarcity relief with long-term development - is that they persist in focusing on the problem rather than on the results. This weakness cannot be eliminated as long as weather cycle instability is considered a matter to be dealt with solely within the agricultural sector. Resources for scarcity relief must be allocated to other projects also when these will yield equal employment and more development benefits. Analysis along these lines cannot be systematically carried on by experts in agriculture or by administrators who have merely temporary and emergency responsibility for scarcity programmes. A permanent, independent organisation that stands apart from the problem-focused agencies alone can think creatively about all the alternatives that might be available.||Morris David Morris

And one must know, too, what decisions they do not make and the pressures which are not brought to bear on them. Strangely little research has been done on questions of this sort. That they are sensitive questions is obvious, but the reason for their neglect seems to lie more in the traditional identification of irrigationas a subject for engineers, not social scientists. What follows is a highly simplified account of the connection between the irrigation bureaucracy and the pattern of distribution of irrigation benefits, which may be useful as a guide to detailed studies ofparticular cases.||Robert Wade

To assess the potential of the Unidad Popular within the structural context of the Chilean political economy and the logic of its development at the time of Allende's victory, we have to come to grips with questions relating to the nature of bourgeois ideology and the likely ways in which the bourgeoisie would react in concrete circumstances where socialist parties enter government by playing according to the bourgeois political rules of the game, but, having come to power, initiate policies which directly challenge the bourgeoisie's control of the economy which lies at the root of their control of the political and state structure. This inevitably leads to questions relating to whether, under any conditions, parliamentary socialism can constitute a viable method or even a preliminary step in the process of reordering and restructuring society in a revolutionary direction.||T.

The most serious question arises from the known inadequacy of the geostationary satellite in meeting the manifold requirements of regional diversity of language and culture. The channel constraint of satellite technology is proposed to be overcome by ISRO by adding four audios to every video. This is a questionable course to adopt since the impact value of such TV programming material on illiterate and unsophisticated rural viewers would be low. Given the regional diversity, the appropriate role for satellite technology in TV development in India is no more than that of providing a national "hook-up" (interconnection) in a conventional TV system. ISRO's attempt to use the space technology as a substitute both for microwave relays as well as conventional TV stations is misconceived in the particular conditions of this country.||B D Dhawan

In relative terms, the ratio of net consumer goods inflow to agriculture to total consumption expenditure in the economy remained fairly stable upto the middle sixties and then declined during the latter half of the second decade. In spite of differences in methodology, the author's results confirm the contention of some earlier studies that the share of non-agricultural goods in total consumption expenditure has declined. But do these results warrant the thesis of a shrinking home market for industrial goods?||Sudipto Mundle

These characteristics are the outcome of certain sociological forces which can be identified. The fact that among the four Dravidian linguistic states of South India, only the Tamil speaking people (except in Kanyakumari district) were not divided into different political entities, gave an extra force to these sociological elements in Tamil society, by facilitating greater geographical mobility of the people. The analysis is based on data derived from the 1961 census, available through the District Census Handbooks, and other connected publications. Even though this information might appear to be not up-to-date, it was considered adequate because the present analysis aims to find an explanation for the emergence of a particular agrarian structure with certain characteristics. The analysis is done at the macro level, with the district as the unit. In view of the peculiar geographical and agricultural characteristics of the Nilgiri district, it has been excluded from the analysis. Kanyakumari district too is not included in the analysis because, geographically and culturally it is more akin to Kerala and until the reorganisation of the states in 1956 was part of the erstwhile Travancore State. Data from the remaining 10 districts are used.||K. C. Alexander

29/3/1975- ||special articles||4536993||Farakka Project: Calcutta Port's Fate in the Balance||The Farakka Barrage was completed nearly five years ago. The feeder canal is ready for commissioning; just cutting a crossbar will enable Farakka waters to flow into the Hooghly via the Bhagirathi to rejuvenate Calcutta port and revitalise Calcutta's water supply. But political difficulties bar the fructification of the project. On February 15, 1974, the then External Affairs Minister, Sardar Swaran Singh, agreed with the Bangladesh Minister for Flood Control, Khondkar Mushtaque Ahmed, that the barrage would not be operated till a "mutually acceptable solution" was arrived at. Earlier, in July 1973; Khondkar Ahmed had remarked in the Bangladesh Parliament that the Farakka barrage was "a real problem" for his country. The statement was unfortunate because it echoed the sentiment expressed by Pakistan in 1969 during the Indo-Pak discussions on the subject. That the Padma and other Bangladesh rivers must not be allowed to degenerate is not questioned. At the same time, must the Calcutta port be allowed to die without headwaters supply from the Ganga, especially when over Rs 140 crores have already been spent by several agencies for this purpose? The Ganga-Padma complex has to be viewed as one integrated system, particularly because India and Bangladesh profess to be two friendly nations.||Tushar Ranjan Patranabis

First, it attempts a comparison of how they look on paper with how they actually work out in practice - as observed by the author and research assistants in various villages in Chingleput District. There follows a discussion of how agricultural operations are carried out by landowners, with holding of various sizes in the irrigated rice areas of the District. Finally, at attempt is made to show how the very nature of the land ceilings has been such as to promote capitalist farming and concentration of political and economic power in the village - not to encourage the small 'peasant farmer' who is so often dealised in the popular slogans for rural India.||Joan P.

This article seeks to examine this hypothesis estimating the relative contribution of different groups of cultivators to the gross value of output from agriculture and to the marketable surplus. The results of the study are broadly in line with the above hypothesis and run counter to the finding of Dharm Narain that holdings below 15 acres contributed more than one-half and those below 10 acres nearly one-half of the total marketable surplus.||Utsa Patnaik

The suggestion to downgrade pharmacists' qualification is fundamentally wrong. One cannot readily accept that there will be no danger in the method of distribution of drugs suggested by the Panel, but the danger can be reduced by taking certain precautions. There can be no doubt that switching from brand names to generic names of drugs is a much-needed reform, but a good deal of rethinking will be necessary and a number of loose ends will need to be tied up before we proceed to implement this reform.||K.

19/7/1975- ||special articles||4537268||Deposit Mobilisation by Co-operative Banks: A Comparison with Scheduled Commercial Banks||The co-operatives have matched the commercial banks in the rate of growth of their deposits. There is complementarity within the co-operative banking system and competition between the co-operative and commercial banking systems with respect to deposit mobilisation. Co-operative Central Banks observe banking principles as much as scheduled commercial banks. They have worked out a stable ratio between demand deposits and time deposits. They have gone further to attract more of demand deposits compared even to the scheduled commercial banks. The State Co-operative Banks, on the other hand, are becoming overcautious and are leaning more towards time deposits. Among the co-operative banks, a large proportion of deposits come from within the co-operative sector. This is an indication of lack of an effective drive to mobilise savings outside of the co-operative fold. This dependence is particularly pronounced among the apex-level banks. Thus though the State Co-operative Banks have a high rate of growth of deposits, a large part of this increase is due to the expansion of the activities of the Central Co-operative Banks.||N.

Although most of the urban women are housewives, they reflect a greater amount of political awareness than the quasi-urban or rural women many of whom are working in industry or agriculture. However, in terms of actual participation in political life, all women display a similar degree of prevalent non-involvement. Economic development in the area has made little difference to the levels of education and political awareness of the majority of the population, though it has contributed to an urban service and trade superstructure which provides jobs for educated personnel who are mostly immigrants. Women belonging to these strata are also significantly above the district average in education and political awareness. There are many indications that this dichotomy will increase rather than disappear.||Indira Rothermund

01/3/1975- ||review of management, march 1975||4536899||Public Sector Management, Social Consciousness, and All That||What is the process implied in 'managing'? Management presupposes a manager and a managed. The manager has authority and control. The managed obeys. The manager and managed stand on opposite sides of the fence and relate to each other fundamentally antagonistically. To say that the manager will manage the managed in the interests of the managed is nothing but to say that, in order to save you I am going to kill you, or to say that in order to improve your welfare I will first deprive you of your welfare. This will not do. This concept of management is an insult to the dignity of human life and equality. The objective, then, should be not to increase production within the existing antagonistic relations but, first and foremost, to create human relations of production and then to harness nature to serve man.||Bharat Jhunjhunwala

But the social practice of untouchability persists - in terms of religious inferiority, social disability, and economic inequality. Indeed, unless the economic conditions of the Scheduled Castes improve, they will not have the required social status. And, unless they get social status, they will not be able to raise their standards of living. In fact, the gap between the scheduled and non-scheduled classes, which was already fairly wide at the time of Independence, has become wider during the subsequent years. The Untouchability Offences Act, 1955, was passed with a view to eradicating the evil of untouchability. This article discusses how the Act has worked in the state of Rajasthan and how the content of the Act can be improved for its effective enforcement.||Girdhar Behari Sharma

Amin's book is an endeavour to explain the pattern of economic development of the world in the last 400 years; to deepen our knowledge about the urrent unevenness of growth among nations; and to set up a perspective in which the future course of the world system can be discerned. If imperialism is embattled today in far-flung areas, how will it regroup and what will be its strategy in the years ahead? Amin has also broken new ground by focusing attention on the transformations in the periphery as the world capitalist system engulfs it. This thread of analysis has to be taken further.||Ranjit San

15/11/1975- ||special articles||40738354||Labour-intensive Construction Methods and Unemployment: World Bank Study on Substitution of Labour and Equipment in Civil Construction||The World Bank's "Study of Substitution Possibilities between Labour and Equipment in Civil Construction" is in the neo-classical tradition which views unemployment as a price problem. Prevailing relative prices do not adequately reflect relative scarcities of capital and labour; wages cr the cost of labour are too high to permit full utilisation of this xibundant factor of production. There is a great deal of technical sophistication, and even technical mystification , in the analysis. The analytical instruments^ tend to become ends rather than means of analysis. We thus have another example of how economics has developed from political economy to become a more or less operational science of management and engineering. The relevance of this approach when it comes to studying and changing the basic economic conditions in countries like India and Indonesia' is not very convincing. There is no attempt to explain the resource allocation, including the 'choice of technique', in the construction sector in the light of a global analysis of these aspects of South Asian development, still less in the context of the structural causes of underdevelopment and underemployment in these societies. The World Bank study is thus another example of a partial equilibrium analysis, an attempt to assess certain equilibrium conditions, mainly in the "factor market" of one sector of a structurally underdeveloped and thus unbalanced national economy. The interest of the World Bank in finding short-term devices to combat unemployment can perhaps be understood against the introductory statement of the report that "The unemployed ... may become dissatisfied with the prevailing political econojnic and social structures of their countries" . While such dissatisfaction by itself is not necessarily conducive to changing these structures, it is precisely such transformation that is required to attack unemployment at its roots. Only in a development strategy that aims at transforming the basic structure of underdeveloped countries, ie, the foreign dependency, ownership and power relations and income distribution, will the development of massive labour-intensive methods in certain sectors become a meaningful and liable means for creating productive employment.||Claes Croner

Since for most services demand exceeds supply, the decision to allocate services becomes complex, making the existing procedures and criteria governing decisions inadequate. Some kind of strategy has to be adopted so that the largest number of groups can be satisfied. This necessarily calls for a compromise approach in the allocation of facilities and services and generates a kind of obligation or reciprocity pattern. This study of Maharashtra examines the considerations which determine decision-making in panchayati raj institutions, identifies the strategies used by decision-makers and explores the basis of the influence structure in these institutions.||S.

A general outline of the social cost-benefit analysis is given and an approach by engineers at the decision-making level to its application to the problem of choice of technology in building construction is suggested. The approach is sufficiently straightforward for it to be made use of as part of the normal process of selecting the technology most suitable for a new building project. In the second section two elements of a building system have been selected and the social cost approach applied for selecting an appropriate technology from a set of alternatives. The third section puts forth certain conclusions based on the analysis carried out in Section II.||K P Kannan,R J S Spence

29/11/1975- ||special articles||40738392||Restructuring Our Universities||The real pressure in higher education is at the undergraduate level. To establish new universities to cope with this pressure is to make the wrong kind of response to the problem. The right response would be to establish new institutional structures to cope with the growing numbers at the undergraduate level. Among other things, this can be done by redefining the concept of the university. Even an association of colleges which does only undergraduate teaching may be legitimately accepted as a university. If in this way problems of postgraduate and undergraduate education can be dealt with separately, there would be enormous saving of resources. The expansion of postgraduate education, which is really expensive, has to be more carefully planned. The experience of the last tivo decades has shown that planning at the Central level has not worked. Nor have the procedures adopted by the Centre or the UGC to deal with the universities and and the state governments been effective. The emphasis, therefore, must now change from the Centre to the states. If this shift of responsibility can be accomplished, the universities, the overwhelming majority of which are state universities, are likely to breathe more easily and give a better account of themselves. At the same time, this might release more funds for undergraduate education than are available today.||Amrik Singh

Yet removal of all rent controls has not been able to solve urban housing problems either, particularly among the low-income classes. In a laissez-faire economy, there may be a market clearing mechanism, but that is no solace to those who are denied any access to the market in view of their low asset holding or earning power. Attention, therefore, needs to be focused not on removal of all rent controls, but on how to modify them so as to meet the objective of efficiency in resource allocation consistently with the redistributive ends of social policy. This article seeks to suggest such a modification in rent control as a tool of public policy.||Deena Khatkhate

With that, India became the world's sixth nuclear power. Though it seemingly surprised outsiders, to India's nuclear scientists and top political leadership it seemed an event they had long expected. The debate about India's nuclear intentions has as a result intensified at home and abroad. How can a poor country afford such scientific extravagance, especially when so much assistance for its nuclear programme has been provided by outsiders? Dangers of further proliferation and irresponsible handling of fissible material have also been cited as unhappy possibilities. Threats of curtailing aid and assistance to India have been made. On the other hand, some Western countries, including France and West Germany, and most of the Eastern Bloc have either approved or accepted the idea of India becoming a nuclear power. Smaller nations in Asia and Africa, barring Pakistan, have hailed the event. China has been silent. Within the country, the government's line has been predictable: this is a minor incident in our total nuclear programme. We will use nuclear energy only for peaceful purposes. The big powers alone can not be allowed to have monopoly over nuclear technology. Majority opinion in the country seems to be in agreement with the government's line. Yet there are some questions which need to be asked: what is the social and economic cost-benefit of all this? What are the economic, scientific, military, political, psychological and other payoffs in the context of our national goals? This paper raises some of these questions.||Aqueil Ahmad

20/12/1975- ||special articles||40738449||Politics of Population Movements: The Case of Bombay||In this paper, an attempt is made to analyse the emergence of this 'nativism' in Bombay. It is shown that the growth of Shiv Sena since the mid-1960s has not been entirely due to the influx of non-Marathi speaking inmigrants to Bombay, and that the causes for the growing strength of 'Nativism' in many areas of the country have not always been of a demographic character. The burgeoning growth of many large cities in India has been due less to natural expansion than to vast urbanward migrations. Bombay, Delhi, and Madras, among others, have seen their populations inflated by the daily arrival of migrants. The large influx of population into the cities has challenged both politicians and planners. Housing, transportation, health, and employment needs of an ever increasing population have taxed the skills of urban administrators and the resources of city governments. In addition, the tensions emerging between migrant and local populations, reflected in the sons-of-the-soil movements, have caused widespread concern.||Mary Fainsod Katzenstein
29/3/1975- ||review of agriculture, march 1975||4536986||Green Revolution and Inequality||An inevitable consequence of the Green Revolution has been increasing inequality in rural India. As the high-yielding varieties of crops require regular supply of irrigation and fairly large amounts of fertilisers, the advantage has been biased towards the large farms. These farms have also begun to substitute capital (e g, tractors) for labour. Since the new varieties are profitable there would be an increase in capitalist farming, an attempt by landlords to evict their tenants and cultivate the land with hired labour, and an attempt by large farmers to buy out small farmers as far as the land ceiling legislation will stretch. In this paper the author presents some empirical evidence from the Ferozepur district of Punjab, to suggest that inequality is increasing in the agricultural sector. The question of the impact of the Green Revolution on employment and wages is not covered here. Empirical evidence on strictly 'farm' incomes and farm size as an index of wealth ownership is looked at. The data used are from the Farm Management Studies for the Ferozepur district of Punjab, for 1968-69 and 1969-70. The approach is to trace, over the period, the changes in the distribution of farm size (wealth); to compare changes in the distribution of Farm Business Income over the period; and then to compare the income distribution with the wealth distribution. The data are for 150 farms chosen on a multi-stage stratified random basis. The advantage of this method of making a comparison over a short period is that changes in each farm can be identified. The disadvantage of this method is that there may not be very many changes in such a short time and, in any case, they may be random ones rather than systematic ones.

It indicates the dimensions of, and the bases for, the power now held by the most advanced form of capitalism so far observable - viz, the transnational corporation. In the past century of industrial capitalism, only the last quarter of it, since the Chinese revolution, has offered evidence of successful struggles by some countries of the periphery. In doing so, genuine development alternatives have been created, giving some fresh hope after the uni-directional path of destruction which had for so long reigned unchallenged.||Peter O'Brien

The presence of enormous unemployment does weaken the impulse of capitalist growth in agriculture. For, rich landowners in such circumstances can extract more surplus through semi-feudal exploitation than through capitalist production. Still one more question remains: Why does not urban, industrial capital penetrate agriculture and transform the semi-feudal mode? There are certain early signs of such a shift, but this trend also would not go very far. The reason lies in one of the "limits of capitalist agriculture" analysed by Kautsky. In the absence of alternative job opportunities in industry, the small peasants would hold on to their land by reducing consumption to an unbelievable minimum. Increasing returns to scale or no increasing returns to scale, the capitalist farmers therefore would face insuperable barriers to ousting the small farms.||Ranjit Sau

Also, no attempt has been made to measure the extent of subsidisation or to evaluate the benefits flowing from it. In this paper, the authors try to fill this void, with regard to expenditure on hostels. The analysis shows that the room rent or hostel service charge levied by the university is not a competitive price because it hardly bears any relation to the demand price or cost or the price charged for similar facilities elsewhere. The universities, in fact, provide the hostel service at a considerably subsidised rate. What is more, the subsidisation has helped even those, belonging to the middle and higher income groups, who could have borne full-cost pricing.||D. T. Lakdawala,K. R. Shah

They have supplemented this assumption with another one: that such marginal change as is possible can only be brought about by a handful of policy-makers - that these policy-makers have the power as well as the desire to bring about change, that if only economists can instruct and convince them about the correct policies such changes as are possible would be effected. Finally, economists have assumed the role of legitimisers with enthusiasm. They have turned out estimates to order and continued to defend them long after events have shown them to be the frauds that they are. The economic and political system in the country is showing sufficient strains for economists to abandon the convenient assumption that no basic changes are ever going to come about in India and to start thinking in terms of alternatives to the present arrangements. It is time economists abandoned their preoccupation with policy-makers and addressed themselves to the people. Instead of drafting and redrafting documents for policy-makers, they should educate the people about the true character of economic policies and the true causes of the present state of affairs. Economists should venture beyond 'economics as such' and participate in real struggles... This list of what economists should do can be lengthened indefinitely. But one soon confronts the basic problem, viz, that the values and commitments of our elite are inimical to the welfare of our country and that economists and other intellectuals are an in distinguishable part of this elite.||Arun Shourie

In brief, the main features of urbanisation in Tamil Nadu during the decade have been: (a) a rapid increase in the urban population; (ii) a striking growth in the number of towns; and, (iii) an increase in the concentration of the urban population in the bigger towns. What kind of economic changes do these trends in urbanisation reflect?||C. T. Kurien,Josef James

The reduced form equation for price is derived from a theoretical model of price determination in the cereals market; statistical estimates of the equation (and its variants) are then obtained using all India annual data for the sample period. The quality of statistical fit of the equations, the signs of estimated co-efficients and the magnitudes of derived estimates of parameters like the price-elasticity of the demand for cereals - all suggest that the equation is reasonably well specified. Conclusions are then drawn in the light of the regression results regarding the role and quantitative importance of the main factors shaping the course of cereals prices. Also implications of these results for certain conceptual and policy issues are noted.||S. K. Chakrabarti

This was his most "Marxist" phase, the Indian summer of his Leftism. The radical Nehru produced consternation among the Indian capitalists and the Right-wing in the Congress. They took certain steps to counter and contain him-thereby revealing a long-term strategy to deal with him and others like him. This paper examines the radicalism of Nehru which frightened the capitalists as well as the counterstrategy which they adopted.||Bipan Chandra

An attempt to understand the present position of the people's communes has, therefore, to be preceded by a study of his views on the role of collectivisation and the place of peasent ownership in Chinese agriculture.||Sreedhar
18/10/1975- ||special articles||40738301||Migration from Villages||The objective of this paper, based on data from 40 Indian villages, is to find answers to the following two major questions on migration : One, which social, economic, and demographic factors in village life are associated with migratory movements? Two, who are the migrants? In this study the authors have used village level data in two ways: to focus attention on differences between villages in terms of migration and other socio-economic variables; and to pool together information on individual migrants in migrating households for several villages, in order to identify the migrant population. The study reveals that while the unequal distribution of resources in the village is a key factor in inducing migration, it is not necessarily the landless or the poorest who migrate. This paper is divided into the following sections: sections 1 and 2 briefly introduce the village studies and the variables we have used in the study; sections 3 and 4 present the main findings of our quantitative analysis based on village and individual level data; and section 5 draws some broad conclusions from our empirical findings.||Biplab Dasgupta,Roy Laishley

The field investigation was carried out in the last one year. The aspects selected for investigation refer to the contractual terms and conditions prevalent between tenants and landowners, cultivators and farm servants, and cultivators and casual labourers. The attempt has been to discover the de facto terms and conditions, and dues and obligations, rather than the de jure state of affairs.||Ashok Rudra

6/12/1975- ||special articles||40740295||Genesis of Agrarian Tension in Thanjavur: Findings of a Research Study||There has been a tendency among some scholars and administrators to trace the genesis of the recent agrarian tensions to the so-called 'green revolution' and the widening of economic disparities in the countryside caused by it. Some others trace the agrarian tensions to the changing values and norms of society. They point out that Indian society has always been stratified, that a wide gulf between the rich and the poor is nothing new and that such a society continued to exist without much tension for a long time as inequality was legitimised by the ideology and values prevalent in the social system. For a variety of reasons these values are now being replaced by a different set of values, emphasising egalitarian relations in different aspects of social life. The agrarian tensions which we are witnessing ure to be traced to this development. This article examines these two views about the causes of agrarian unrest. It is based on a study of two taluks of east Thanjavur district in Tamil Nadu.||K C Alexander

This hypothesis has given rise to much controversy, both at the theoretical and empirical levels, regarding the potency of dividend policy. However, empirical verification of the hypothesis has so far remained confined to the capital markets of the advanced countries, mainly the USA. Here an empirical study of Indian capital markets over the nine years, 1964-1972, in respect of three industries - chemicals, general engineering and jute textiles - is attempted with a view to testing this hypothesis.||Sankar De
