13/3/2010-19/3/2010||commentary||25664214||Janani Suraksha Yojana and the Maternal Mortality Rate||Surveys indicate that the Janani Suraksha Yojana, which offers cash assistance to pregnant women opting for institutional deliveries, has increased the number of such births in hospitals. Can this increase be used as an indicator of a decrease in the maternal mortality rate? It is likely that the cash incentive may disproportionately attract pregnant women without complications to institutions, while the increased workload leads to women with complications not getting proper treatment. To evaluate the programme adequately, studies in states with a high maternal mortality rate based on a representative sample of institutions with and without emergency obstetric services are needed.||ANRUDH K JAIN
17/7/2010-23/7/2010||perspective||20764311||Primary Accumulation, Capitalist Nature and Sustainability||The relationship between capital and nature gravitates towards a policy of primary accumulation. This article provides an analysis of the imposition of capitalist property rights over natural resources in India as processes of primary accumulation. These processes are evidenced by the construction of large dams and mines, in addition to the proliferation of free market environmentalism. Moreover, the scope for primary accumulation remains substantial in view of the hydel potential and new circuits of accumulation emerge under the auspices of free market environmentalism. Are the desiderata of ecological sustainability and human development realised under the logic of primary accumulation and a neoliberal commitment to economic growth?||SIRISHA C NAIDU,PANAYIOTIS T MANOLAKOS

Eighty years later, Time's 31 December 1999 end-of-the-century issue named Gandhi (along with Albert Einstein and Franklin Roosevelt) as "Person of the Century". Gandhi has re-entered American consciousness with the recent visit to India of an American president who, in his Nobel Peace Prize speech of 10 December 2009, made clear that he admired and learned from Gandhi and Martin Luther King, Jr.||LLOYD I RUDOLPH

Based on an analysis of his Kashmir: Nava-e Hurriyat ("Kashmir: Voice of Freedom"), this article lays out Geelani's understanding of the genesis of the Kashmir conflict, his critique of Indian rule, his advocacy for Kashmir's accession to Pakistan, his opposition to independence for Jammu and Kashmir, his understanding of the relation between Islam, politics and the state, and his views on jihad, nationalism and inter-community relations. All these issues are central to the ongoing conflict in and over Kashmir. The article also discusses a central paradox: If only a minority of the Muslims of Jammu and Kashmir support the state's accession to Pakistan, why is it that Geelani, who has consistently advocated the state's merger with Pakistan, continues to be regarded as the icon of the Kashmiri Muslim resistance movement?||YOGINDER SIKAND

The gram sabha, the basic unit in the process of forest rights recognition, has been replaced by the gram sansad, denoting the village level constituency under the panchayati raj system. This has been followed by contiguous arrangements as well as initiatives which are inconsistent with the Act. All these factors have led to undermining the spirit of the Act to promote community governance of forests, which has invoked stiff opposition from forest dwellers in the region.||SOURISH JHA

While the financial performance of the ports is improving marginally in value terms, problems of productivity and efficiency affect their operations. In this paper, we measure productivity and efficiency of the 12 major ports of India by making use of Data Envelopment Analysis. The Malmquist Productivity Indices, computed for the sample period 2001-08, differ substantially from port to port. While there has been a significant improvement in the performance of major ports since 1991, much more needs to be done in terms of bringing in modern technology in traffic handling.||J G R MONTEIRO

Is it all just a "neuter" body, where femaleness is all what society has constructed, or, is there a female body which is a given, biologically? Insofar as feminism has tried to engage with sex and gender, by trying to move away from a biological essentialism, and in trying to focus on differences between women by caste, class and ethnicity, it deflected attention away from the female body itself. The feminist viewpoint thereby became unable to speak of the body as a subject.||MAITHREYI KRISHNARAJ

In spite of disavowal by the Indian state, current international debate on indigenous tribal peoples may serve as a crucial point of departure to historicise the self-definitions of indigenous tribes and also to document little known struggles of non-dominant internal minorities like the Zo people who inhabit India's eastern borderland. There are significant historical anomalies specific to the "hill tribals" of Manipur. Foregrounding such singular conditions may explain, at least in part, why and how Manipur remains in a state of siege, especially since the 1980s. Perhaps a degree of compromise may be required, if not desirable, between liberal regimes that represent dominant interests on the one hand, and indigenous collective claims to some sort of redress for past wrongs â€” especially when they have the force of justice behind them, on the other hand.||DAVID VUMLALLIAN ZOU

The state has failed to augment agrarian reforms and public investment in agriculture has been on the decline.

This paper argues that an entire industry has emerged to manage them and yet academic literature has fallen behind in its analysis. There is a political economy of landmines, with a structure, market and competing interests, whose politics are expressed globally and locally. Both the manufacture and use of landmines, as well as the opposition and demining, are part of an organised sector, while local autonomous methods of dealing with landmines remain beyond the pale. This article, based on research in a study area in the K5 mine belt in Cambodia, uses qualitative methodology driven by a feminist perspective to question the wisdom of the landmine sector based almost entirely on quantitative data.||JEAN CHAPMAN

Critical of the elitist approach of the Subaltern Studies group which depicts tribal/peasant revolts as "autonomous" and marked by "territoriality", this paper argues how these two movements transgressed the boundaries ascribed to them. Both the movements strategically employed a discourse of equality to fight their immediate oppressors. The Mahima movement represented an anti-caste, monotheistic order that sought to delegitimise the rajas and the brahmins. Similarly, the Munda protest (that was led by the Mundas who had converted to Christianity) in 1939 opposed the princely state of Gangpur and also confronted colonialism. In discussing these movements, the essay aims to delineate the fascinating aspects of popular imagination even as it highlights some of the limitations of the two uprisings.||BISWAMOY PATI

There are many imponderables that the arrested leaders have to confront: their ability to carry the rank and file (even if the powerful military chief has shown hints of a rethink), ULFA's links with other separatist groups, the position of the leaders who were arrested earlier and of other groups drawn to the idea of an "independent" Assam. At the same time there are other factors at play which could "wonderfully concentrate the minds" of the ULFA leaders on a settlement with the government of India.||M S PRABHAKARA

Innovative SMES, engaged in both product and process innovations, could achieve a considerable increase in their sales and employment during 2001-02 to 2005-06. But in the midst of high turnover rates of employees, comprising largely skilled and unskilled workers with a marginal presence of technical employees, the incremental nature of innovations and a significant employment growth, innovation did not have a positive impact on labour productivity growth. Upgrading the quality of innovations, adopting strategies to retain the trained technical/skilled labour and undergoing training in "innovation management" to optimally employ factor inputs are suggested to enable SMES reap "productive benefits" from their innovations.||M H BALA SUBRAHMANYA

The logic of competitive striving for the export market among the many "labour reserve" economies in the periphery leads to the accumulation of ever-growing reserves and a constraint on domestic absorption. To believe that the contradictions that emerge will disappear if only the economies with current surpluses appreciate their exchange rates is a fantasy. Such an appreciation, if it is not to reduce the level of activity in the appreciating economies, must be accompanied by an enlargement of the fiscal deficit in these economies, which means both an abandonment of the tenet of "sound finance" and increased domestic absorption entailing a retreat from the strategy of export-led growth.||PRABHAT PATNAIK

Since structural indicators of competition do not always reflect or imply abuse, firm conduct is gauged from an extensive primary survey of users and vendors. The study finds that while competition in the high-end server market has developed, it also cautions that expansion in the future installed base of such high-end systems could warrant a closer look by the Competition Commission of India into the potential welfare implications arising from vendor lock-in.||RAJAT KATHURIA,SUBHASIS BERA

However, when we pair administrative banking data on availability of bank branches in a state with the All India Debt and Investment Survey (2002-03) capturing both institutional and non-institutional borrowing by households, we find that states with the most access to institutional finance, or supply, are not necessarily the ones with the most demand for finance. Looking at household level data within each state we identify determinants of institutional borrowing, and some of the strongest predictors for accessing institutional finance. A number of empirical regularities emerge in terms of the importance of having assets like land for borrowing, which undermines the basic philosophy of financial inclusion.||RAJALAXMI KAMATH,ARNAB MUKHERJI,MARIA SANDSTRÃ–M

There were a number of long-term trends that were working towards the surge in food prices, which was finally occasioned by some proximate causes. While global prices have eased since then â€” though not in India â€” there are lessons to be drawn from the 2008 crisis. There is a need to increase food production without raising prices to consumers. This calls for significant public support for food production. Yet, the poverty and much more limited fiscal capacity of developing countries as well as the liberalised agricultural trade regulations over recent decades constrain them from being more supportive of food security efforts. In addition, international public support has fallen off since the 1980s as agro-business corporate interests increasingly influence public policy, trade regulations and access to technology.||JOMO KWAME SUNDARAM

This study examines the role of inter- as well as intramolecular competition, apart from the extent of therapeutic advantage that a new molecule offers, in the determination of the level and rate of change in drug prices. In a regime where product patents are also recognised and the competitive pressures are going to be limited, the need for price monitoring and control would be greater for therapeutically superior drugs. Also drugs which are predominant in their class for specific indication need to be monitored.||RAVINDER JHA

After a brief introduction to the basic economic principles underlying modern competition law, this article reviews the country's experience with the MRTP Act. It argues that the way it was structured, amended, interpreted and enforced ensured that it could not really serve as a competition law. Consequently, it did not bequeath a body of expertise that could help in the implementation of its successor, the Competition Act, which is very demanding in terms of economic analysis. The strengths and weaknesses of the new law, the reasons for its delayed implementation, and the first few decisions of the Competition Commission of India are discussed.||ADITYA BHATTACHARJEA

However, the recent controversy over the "New Delhi" superbug shows how the politics of science research publication affects the manner in which such research is disseminated and received, both within the science establishment and in public policy. It is imperative that governments take corrective, and precautionary, measures based on a dispassionate reading of the evidence, rather than focus only on the unfortunate nomenclature used for identifying this particular germ.||AMIT MISRA

While not denying the pertinence of such an approach, this paper contends, from a development ethics perspective with reference to India, that an ethos of egalitarian sensibility across the whole spectrum of society is fundamental to equitable development. Through the lens of Levinas' notion of the "other but equal", and Rawls' rejection of moral deserts in the case of human natural endowments as basic to social cooperation, an egalitarian sensibility is viewed as the "moral-sensual" assertion of the other's egality and dignity. Transformative education, civil society activism and cultural dynamism, the paper argues, are central to acquiring an egalitarian sensibility.||SIBY K GEORGE

In order to understand how exactly journalists really function it is necessary to understand the overall context in which they operate and clarify some of the persistent myths about what the profession is all about. Four myths in particular need to be dissected: That it enjoins journalists, more than other professionals, to be ethical, that they should and can be neutral in their reportage, that owners of media businesses are interested in good journalism and that journalism is the prerogative of those employed in the media industry.||SATYA SAGAR

Relying on a wide-ranging literature review, this article analyses the alleged impacts of such plantations, the protesters involved, and the modalities of the conflicts. It finds that the prominent cause of resistance is related to corporate control over land resulting in displacement and the end of local uses of ecosystem resources. Resistance includes the "weapons of the weak" and ranges from dialogue to direct confrontation. Authorities have responded by repression in half of the cases reported, while popular struggles have been successful in about one-fifth. These movements can be understood as forms of the "environmentalism of the poor".||JULIEN-FRANÃ‡OIS GERBER

First, the nature of legality cannot be defined in narrow terms of mining laws, but needs to cover the environmental and social goods that lie in its ambit. Second, the massive growth in mining is directly related to the nature of economic liberalisation and loosening of government controls. Present mechanisms of administrative and judicial oversight have proved insufficient to stop this loot.||GOPAL K KADEKODI

Ila Mitra's articulations and determined resistance reveal a deep identification with the adivasis that runs deeper than ideological solidarity and has rarely found place in our political cultures. In the contemporary context of political crackdowns on tribal populations, the relation of political parties with the people assumes criticality. Actual political engagement across caste and tribe calls for some understanding of committed and affective processes of negotiating difference, and while there are risks involved, there are also compelling solidarities that are possible.||KAVITA PANJABI

In these days of postmodern critical analysis, the orthodoxy about "objectivity" has long been eroded, but the deliberate blurring of distinction between "fact" and propaganda, reality and stereotype, and the discursive stringing together of sensational events, finds a new level in news media-mediated public discourse. The article critically interrogates the rhetorical clustering of four mediatised "events" â€” Madrid 3/11/2004, London 7/7/2005, Mumbai 11/7/2006 and 26/11/2008 â€” which raised the spectre of an interconnected and endless "war on terror" as a knee- jerk political and media response.||RITA MANCHANDA

Using in-depth interviews with men and women from eastern India and northern Bangladesh, it stresses the narrative accounts of the migrants, their tales of travelling to various destinations and the significance of the remittances they earned. Through these accounts, the aim is to show the resourcefulness and agency required to engage in begging. Begging may be necessary to better respond to food and cash hardships in poor landless households in rural settings. It is neither a deliberate act of avoiding work nor an institutional tradition.||DEEPTIMA MASSEY,ABDUR RAFIQUE,JANET SEELEY

This article analyses the trends in the import intensity of exports of seven conventional SEZS from 1986-87 to 2007-08. Changes in the sectoral composition of exports are mainly responsible for the increased import intensity of SEZ exports, particularly after the new policy was announced in 2000-01. The government thus needs to follow a cautious approach in promoting SEZS under different sectors and redefine the current fiscal incentives to prevent reallocation of investment from domestic trade areas to the SEZS.||MALINI L TANTRI

This paper reports and discusses a 2008 resurvey of Iruvelpattu, one of the five Slater villages in Tamil Nadu. The 2008 study tells the story of persistence of landlord power, continuing dependence of a majority of households on agriculture in spite of the significant diversification of employment that has taken place, and an apparent stagnation in the agricultural economy after the relative success of the green revolution in the 1970s. It also brings out a tightening in the labour market and dalit political mobilisation as well as a shift in agricultural wage rates. However, the level of state intervention in the interests of social security through primary healthcare provision, schools in which teachers are actually present, and the maintenance of a universal public distribution system as well as the operation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, all distinguish Iruvelpattu generally from villages in other parts of the country.||JOHN HARRISS,J JEYARANJAN,K NAGARAJ

This new development became clear during the inquiry regarding the Malegaon blast of 2008. The Hindu militants who were allegedly responsible for this attack were all members of a new group, Abhinav Bharat, which resorted to violent action to resist the Islamists by emulating them. This article is based on the police report on the Malegaon case, a very interesting source for two reasons. One, it provides rich pieces of factual information regarding the actors of the plot and their motivations. Two, it presents us with the discourse of the Hindu nationalists when they speak between themselves since these excerpts include the transcripts of secret meetings they held in 2007-08 that one of the participants recorded.||CHRISTOPHE JAFFRELOT

Maghai, the landless untouchable farmer and water diviner in Mahasweta Devi's Water written in 1972 continues Hori's tale of despair. The story explores the interweaving of the dynamics of rural poverty with the machinations of the local landed elite in collusion with local officials and the police. The village teacher and Maghai's son are both aware of the corruption but are afraid to protest too loudly for fear of being arrested as Naxalites. In view of the reports of fraud and corruption in the functioning of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in many villages, this article looks at the different forms of cheating practised in the name of providing relief to the poor with specific reference to Devi's story.||VANASHREE

It looked at three key dimensions â€” mobility, decision-making and sense of self-worth. The findings show that agency was clearly constrained among youth in this setting, irrespective of gender and the rural-urban divide. Second, young women had significantly lower levels of agency than young men on mobility and decision-making, but appeared to have a significantly higher sense of self-worth. Third, the rural-urban differences were negligible and considerably narrower than gender differences. Fourth, older respondents were progressively more likely to report agency on all three dimensions. Age and education were consistently and positively associated with almost every measure of agency for both young women and men.||SHIREEN JEJEEBHOY,RAJIB ACHARYA,MALLIKA ALEXANDER,LAILA GARDA,SAVITA KANADE

The results indicate low teacher attendance and poor student learning. Parents and school committees are neither aware of their oversight roles nor do they participate in school management. However, there is substantial heterogeneity in outcomes across states. Karnataka has better student and teacher outcomes, as well as higher levels of community awareness and participation than the other two states. The authors find substantial variation in teacher effort within schools, but most observable teacher characteristics are not associated with teacher effort. One reason for low teacher effort may be a lack of accountability. However, the gains in test scores associated with higher rates of teacher attendance and engagement in teaching are estimated to be small in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, suggesting that teachers themselves may not be effective.||PRIYANKA PANDEY,SANGEETA GOYAL,VENKATESH SUNDARARAMAN

It indicates that there are political business cycles in spending by MPS. Moreover, it shows that the degree of competition faced by an MP in the last election, his/her age, and political affiliation significantly affect fund utilisation. It also concludes that a higher level of awareness of general citizens and better law and order conditions in states restrict the MPS from misusing funds to gain political mileage.||RUPAYAN PAL,APARAJITA DAS

Though rich in satirical detail, the film is "humanist" rather than political, in that it is both non-committal and deceptive in its approach to rural indebtedness and in its treatment of the media. Peepli delivers the subliminal message that little can be done about rural indebtedness because its economic/political causes cannot be identified.||M K RAGHAVENDRA

The Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen or the Majlis party, which has been strengthened by the communal politics of other parties, is today helping to revive Hindu communalism through its own politics of keeping religious divides alive.

5/6/2010-11/6/2010||special article||27807109||The Strange Death of the International Liberal Order||Using Eric Hobsbawm's notion of the "short 20th century", it is argued that international politics during the 20th century was not so much a struggle between different state forms. Rather, it was a product of the various responses to the underlying social conflicts stemming from the emergence of the working class and socialist movements, themselves a consequence of capitalist development. And on the same lines, it is suggested that the post-war liberal order can be identified in terms of a form of social constitutionalism that reflected these twin social settlements within advanced industrial countries as well as within the structures of the global multilateral system. The death of post-war liberalism can only be understood in terms of the collapse of the broader project of social democratisation that marked the "short 20th century".||KANISHKA JAYASURIYA

It briefly discusses the implication of treating this combination as union or intersection of the three sets of people, suffering from these three types of poverty. It also brings out the significance of looking at extreme poverty in a human rights perspective, and what is its value addition to programmes of poverty eradication in different countries. Besides, it elaborates on the formulation of such programmes, in terms of human rights obligation through national actions, extending them to programmes of international actions. By spelling out the characteristics of these actions that make them conform to a human rights approach, it discusses some of the anti-poverty programmes that have been used in different countries like the United States, European Union, Africa and Asia and how they differ from a rights-based approach that has been developed in this paper.||ARJUN SENGUPTA

Confirmed wild poliovirus cases are increasingly concentrated amongst Muslim children and localised in western Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The Pulse Polio Initiative has responded by pressurising parents into complying with the administration of multiple doses of polio vaccine to their children. But almost all new cases occur among children who have been vaccinated many times. The problems inhere in the weaknesses of government health services and in the PPI'S inadequacies and errors: a focused top-down programme using the wrong vaccine and with dubious targets. It has lost its way and requires a radical shake-up.||PATRICIA JEFFERY,ROGER JEFFERY

We now have four documents - two authored by senior leaders of the Maoists and two sympathetic accounts - which allow us to evaluate in a limited fashion the work of the Maoists over the past quarter century of operations. The story that comes across is a dismal one. The State earlier did nothing for the adivasis but, considering the time the Maoists have spent in the region, they themselves have achieved little by way of adivasi welfare, be it in wages, education, health or agriculture. This is because the Maoists' politics of waging guerrilla warfare on the road to seizure of state power has meant that they must focus on using the adivasis for their war.||NIRMALANGSHU MUKHERJI

Kaiga and Other Nuclear Stories||The November 2009 exposure of employees at the Kaiga nuclear power plant to tritiated water is not the first instance of high radiation exposures to workers. Over the years, many nuclear reactors and other facilities associated with the nuclear fuel cycle operated by the Department of Atomic Energy have had accidents of varying severity. Many of these are a result of repeated inattention to good safety practices, often due to lapses by management. Therefore, the fact that catastrophic radioactive releases have not occurred is not by itself a source of comfort. To understand whether the DAE'S facilities are safe, it is therefore necessary to take a closer look at their operations. The description and discussion in this paper of some accidents and organisational practices offer a glimpse of the lack of priority given to nuclear safety by the DAE. The evidence presented here suggests that the organisation does not yet have the capacity to safely manage India's nuclear facilities.||M V RAMANA,ASHWIN KUMAR

Capital flows, the third leg, call for capital account regulations in both developing and developed countries. In the former, regulations can be justified as a way to help authorities avoid exchange rate appreciation while reducing the need for costly and/or useless foreign exchange reserve accumulation. In the advanced economies, the effectiveness of monetary expansion may be enhanced if they reduce the leakages generated by short-term capital outflows. This would, in fact, imply a return to the basic principle under which the IMF was built: that it is in the best interests of all members to allow countries to pursue their own full employment macroeconomic policies, even if this required regulating capital flows.||JOSÃ‰ ANTONIO OCAMPO

It examines two features of the downturn: one, the much sharper fall in the volume of trade than that in income, and, two, the much higher GDP-buoyancy of trade during the crisis than before. The paper first examines how far trade buoyancy and its asymmetric behaviour can be explained in terms of a conventional, open-economy macro model and analyses the implications of intra-industry trade in this context. It then focuses on the significance of the financial shock for the two phenomena under investigation. This is followed by a discussion of the impact of large-scale expansionary measures undertaken by governments of both the advanced and emerging market economies, and an evaluation of the efficacy and optimality of these measures from the national and global perspectives.||MIHIR RAKSHIT

Questions of the conformity of Indian projects to the provisions of the treaty can indeed arise, but the agreement provides institutional mechanisms for dealing with them. By presenting a "non-paper" to India about its concerns on the sharing of river waters, Pakistan is therefore setting out on a dangerous path that could have major implications.

The indemnity for suppliers is meant to please multinational plant vendors who wish to be free of liability even for accidents that result from a design flaw. The cap on operator liability is far lower than the potential damage that a nuclear accident could cause. This clause is designed to facilitate the entry of domestic big business into the nuclear market by ensuring that domestic operators will not be held responsible in the eventuality of damage following an accident. Hence the bill transfers risks for a nuclear mishap onto the people at large. Furthermore, it offers almost no financial disincentive for unsafe behaviour on part of the operators and suppliers of nuclear plants.||SUVRAT RAJU,M V RAMANA

The exercise begins by accepting the official all-India urban poverty estimate of 25.7% for 2004-05, then derives the all-India urban poverty line that corresponds to this head count ratio by using the multiple rather than uniform reference period distribution from the NSS data. It then recalculates, based on this modified poverty line, new state-wise urban and rural poverty lines that reflect spatial variations in the cost of living in 2004-05. The resulting estimates of the incidence of rural poverty show a head count ratio of 41.8% for 2004-05 as against the official estimate of 28.3%. The estimates reveal much larger rural-urban differences but less concentration of either rural or urban poverty in a few states. Although the new poverty lines preserve the official estimate of all-India urban poverty in 2004-05, there are significant changes at the state level.||HIMANSHU

This paper argues instead that this importance of unorganised manufacturing was not so much the result of weakening trade unionism and a vulnerable workforce, but the outcome of an implicit understanding between the trade unions and the management.

It makes a strong case for a group approach to agricultural investment and production by promoting collectivities of the poor which, it argues, would be much more effective on all these counts than the traditional individualâ€”oriented approaches. The collectivities proposed here, however, are small-sized, voluntary, socioâ€”economically homogeneous and participatory in decision-making, in keeping with the principles emphasised in a human rights approach to development. The paper describes a range of successful cases of agricultural production collectivities from the transition economies and south Asia.

This article summarises the current state of knowledge and argues that (a) we do not have a good understanding of the drivers and economic effects of broadband in India, and (b) this lack of understanding is largely due to the absence of a systematic way of monitoring the technological pulse of the nation.||ANINDYA CHAUDHURI

The only mantra on financial sector reforms that we hear from some senior government officials and influential academicians is to dismantle all controls on cross-border capital flows, go in for market-determined exchange rates and interest rates, downsize the powers of the Reserve Bank of India to that of a pure monetary authority, transfer all the market regulation powers to the Securities and Exchange Board of India and opt for free financial markets. In all these reform packages there is often no recognition of the fact that, at the current stage of its economic development, the country needs different sets of solutions. Markets alone are not going to be the solution for all our problems. All those who talk of totally free markets do not recognise that we need broad-based industrialisation and infrastructure development to tackle poverty and that the financial sector should clearly serve as an instrument to achieve these objectives.||R H PATIL

It proposes a rationalisation of such fees by looking into the demand draft charges of 37 select banks comprising 89% of the network of bank branches in India. The analysis carried out here has an underlying premise that competitive market pricing is required to safeguard consumer interest, and if the market fails to have a pricing structure which is competitive, it becomes imperative to take recourse to public policy to protect consumer interest.||ASHISH DAS,RAJEEV KUMAR,PRASANNA KUMAR

In exploring alternative approaches for identifying a "social assistance base", of which the BPL list can be seen as a particular case, this note explores possible uses of simple exclusion and inclusion criteria. It first considers the possibility of a quasiâ€”universal approach, whereby all households are eligible unless they meet preâ€”specified exclusion criteria. It then looks at various inclusion criteria for drawing up a SAB list. Finally, it explores four simple ways of combining exclusion and inclusion criteria to construct a SAB list. The intention here is to point to possible directions of further enquiry, including experimental applications of the suggested method, rather than to present definite recommendations. Whether any convincing method of selecting SAB households actually exists is an open question. Some of the findings here can be read as a reinforcement of the case for a universal approach. Indeed, the search for a "safe" way of excluding privileged households, without significant risk of exclusion for poor households, remains somewhat elusive.||JEAN DRÃˆZE,REETIKA KHERA

With so many questions on the project â€” regarding biometrics, security and privacy â€” yet to be answered, it is far from time for parliamentary approval.

The colonial government, which introduced new technological systems such as electricity, had its own economic and political priorities. These interests came in conflict with the functions which the Indians wanted the electricity system to perform. This disjunction influenced the trajectory of development of the electricity system. There was a further interesting internal conflict. Local politicians, technologists and visionaries grounded their economic advocacy on their own ideologies and tried to allocate their own functions to electricity. The second part of the article deals with the relationship between regional politics and electricity. In Madras presidency, the electricity system was divided into two separate grids. This resulted in widening the economic gap between the southern and northern parts of the presidency, leading also to political tensions which, combined with linguistic regionalism, contributed to the split of the presidency and the emergence of linguistic states.||YENDA SRINIVASA RAO

This debate has reached India where the government has proposed mandatory labels. Mandatory labelling aims to provide greater information and correspondingly more informed consumer choice. However, even without such laws, markets have incentives to supply labels. So can mandatory labelling achieve outcomes different from the voluntary type? The paper argues that this is not the case in most situations. It goes on to explore the special set of circumstances, where mandatory labels make a difference to outcomes. If these outcomes are intended, mandatory labelling is justified; otherwise not. Although the Indian context provides the motivation, the core arguments given are general and applicable to other country contexts as well.||SANGEETA BANSAL,BHARAT RAMASWAMI
26/6/2010-9/7/2010||review of agriculture||40736698||Agricultural Price Policy, Farm Profitability and Food Security||Agricultural price policy has come under serious attack recently for recommending support prices higher than what the costs of production warrant, supposedly leading to a distortion of the market, and, therefore, to food deprivation. With an in-depth analysis of costs and returns in rice and wheat, which are the most state-protected crops and underlie the livelihoods of millions of farmers, this paper examines the effectiveness of agricultural price policy in enabling farmers to obtain sufficient profits to promote investment, technology and productivity and thereby to food security. The rising cost of production due to the overemphasis on getting input prices right is a major factor that has led to higher support prices. Another factor is the percolation of volatility in global prices through trade liberalisation. Because. of this, wheat support prices had to be hiked steeply in recent years so that sufficient quantities are procured. This has distorted parity between the prices of rice and wheat.||S MAHENDRA DEV,N CHANDRASEKHARA RAO

It is natural to think that the pleasures of life are indeed miscellaneous, more like those of literature than of philosophy because literature is an outgrowth of life while philosophy is an abstraction from it. But if literature is inherently miscellaneous, and if miscellany depends on singular objects tied to qualities that pre-empt obsolescence, then life all around us seems to resist any resemblance to literature.||AKEEL BILGRAMI

Time use surveys which were originally designed to capture women's contribution in unpaid productive work are now increasingly being used to understand and measure unpaid care work. However, these surveys are often designed within a very limited and simplistic understanding of care work, caregivers and the relationship that governs such work. The 1998-99 time use survey conducted by the Central Statistical Organisation is the only large-scale one on unpaid care in India. This paper critically discusses the scope, design/methodology of the survey and raises issues that are significant in capturing unpaid care work.||NEETHA N

This paper evaluates the impact of such accessibility in a mid-Himalayan belt of Himachal Pradesh, through field studies.

These projects are facing opposition from the people, especially those likely to be displaced and those who will be indirectly affected. At the same time, the state's woes â€“ poverty and unemployment â€“ remain to be addressed. Against this backdrop, this article examines â€“ both analytically and empirically â€“ the path taken by the three important sectors of the state: agriculture, industry, and mining. Based on an inter-district and inter-state panel analysis, the paper highlights the serious decline in the Orissa's agricultural sector â€“ still the only significant determinant of per capita income in the state â€“ while the mining sector, be it in production or exports, has flourished.||BANIKANTA MISHRA

As the frequency of such shocks is expected to rise, India needs to have an effective food management strategy to deal with these episodes. It also needs to explore various other options for price stabilisation like maintaining buffer stocks and using trade. The economy has to invest heavily in expanding storage capacity for various types of foods in both the public as well as private sectors. Due to fluctuations in growth, the export of some commodities in one or two years is followed by their imports, which invariably involves a large variation in costs and prices. As India is a net exporter of food, a part of what is now exported needs to instead become part of domestic stabilisation stocks.||RAMESH CHAND

The result has been a pattern of consumption of the means to mobility which discourages discussion of its impacts, just as surely as it subdues debate about alternatives.

This paper presents an account of how these actors positioned themselves around not only the creation of the tiger reserve, but also the proposed elephant corridor and the Forest Rights Act of 2006. It suggests that due process of law has not been followed adequately and that sufficient scientific evidence has not been presented in the public domain as required. The Forest Rights Act is seen to offer an opportunity to democratise the management of natural resources with all its social and ecological complexities and provide the necessary checks and balances to bring about conservation based strongly on scientific evidence.||DANIEL TAGHIOFF,AJIT MENON

The 60th national morbidity and healthcare survey of the National Sample Survey Organisation provides an opportunity to examine the impoverishing effect of healthcare spending in India. This paper presents an analysis of the NSSO survey data with some new approaches to correcting some of the biases in previous assessments of the "impoverishing" effect of health spending. Despite these corrections, the results suggest that the extent of impoverishment due to healthcare payments is higher than previously reported. Furthermore, outpatient care is more impoverishing than inpatient care in urban and rural areas alike. The analysis of the extent of impoverishment across states, regions (urban and rural areas), income quintile groups, and between outpatient care and inpatient care yields some interesting results.||PETER BERMAN,RAJEEV AHUJA,LAVEESH BHANDARI

In an attempt to understand the multilayered articulation of the demand for a separate Telangana, we decided to speak to a cross section of people on their participation and their aspirations â€” people across political formations and social backgrounds. Our travels took us to small farmers, pastoralists, intellectuals, coal miners, schoolteachers, weavers, traders and dhobis; Muslim, adivasi, dalit and student leaders; we attended meetings in adivasi hamlets, in working class urban neighbourhoods and we visited shibirams (tents) across the region and spoke to people on relay hunger strikes. We see quite clearly the emergence of a new politics that is committed to deliberating over the meanings of democracy and direct action. People's demand for Telangana elaborates a complex set of arguments in relation to investment, employment, education, land, water, and resources. But more importantly it has to do with self-rule, dignity and self-respect, which are the fundamental premises of the Telangana movement. The separate state is seen as only the first step towards democratisation.||KALPANA KANNABIRAN,SAGARI R RAMDAS,N MADHUSUDHAN,S ASHALATHA,M PAVAN KUMAR

In addition, it is on the basis of the dubious legal proposition of faith and belief that the court arrives at a finding of legal and lawful ownership. The placing of idols in the disputed site in 1949 was as much an act of illegality as the events of 6 December 1992, but the court gingerly steps around them.

Large inequities in health and access to health services continue to persist and have even widened across states, between rural and urban areas, and within communities. Three forms of inequities have dominated India's health sector. Historical inequities that have their roots in the policies and practices of British colonial India, many of which continued to be pursued well after independence; socio-economic inequities manifest in caste, class and gender differentials; and inequities in the availability, utilisation and affordability of health services. Of these, critical to ensuring health for all in the immediate future will be the effectiveness with which India addresses inequities in provisioning of health services and assurance of quality care.||RAMA BARU,ARNAB ACHARYA,SANGHMITRA ACHARYA,A K SHIVA KUMAR,K NAGARAJ

The gender regimes that operate in the cultural context of Bengal draw heavily on the concept of bhalo meye â€” an ideological construct of the ideal woman. This paper examines the daily lives of women with locomotor disabilities in Bengal, who grow up negotiating their impaired bodies and internalising sociocultural constructions of the "normal" female body. Disabled women strive to adhere to the socially acceptable ideas about a bhalo meye through different strategies of presenting a feminine self, in gait and bearing, in dress and comportment. On the one hand, they internalise normative ideologies about a bhalo meye and on the other, are forced to accept the material reality of their impairments while perfecting their performance as women.||NANDINI GHOSH

It first stalled radical reform measures to restrict the activities of banks and break down institutions that were too big to fail. The focus then shifted to Basel III proposals that would strengthen capital requirements. But the global banks have now managed to dilute even the Basel proposals so as to make the changes currently on the table insubstantial.||C P CHANDRASEKHAR

There were large variations across the country â€“ by region, within big urban conurbations, from one neighbourhood to the next. It was yet a very accurate, even curiously united, reflection of the British political mood. The overall message from voters was clear. After 13 years of the false promise of "New Labour" the voters had had enough, but the Conservatives, with their hands caught in the expenses scandal and with public doubts about their willingness to confront the bankers, had not impressed either.||SARAH McROBB

The tragedy of electoral democracy in Sri Lanka is that elections do not seem to help the political class to negotiate and settle their contradictions and resolve problems in the polity. Rather, elections compel the factions of the political class to resort to false agendas and, in turn, to invent and pursue enmities. Although the civil war is over, the trajectory of the island's post-civil war politics is still in the process of being formed. One thing though seems clear. Neither the ruling party nor the opposition (not even the minority parties) are going to place the rights of the minorities at the centre of their political agenda.||JAYADEVA UYANGODA

What we are looking for is regulation that makes the financial system less sensitive to error in the estimate of risk, not more so. There are two ways to do this. The first is to observe that this error is strongly correlated to the boom-bust cycle; counter-cyclical capital requirements will be part of this approach. Another way is to limit the flow of risks to institutions with a structural capacity for holding that risk.||AVINASH PERSAUD

However, a lowering of inequality has not made the situation more equitable for the poor because of a high increase in the rate of inpatient care utilisation, a decline in dependence on government hospitals and a steep hike in the cost of inpatient care. In a majority of states, the average cost of inpatient care, even at government hospitals, has grown at a much higher rate than the prices of essential food items. The hardships faced by the rural poor to meet healthcare expenses show that the net result has been a welfare loss for them.||SUBRATA MUKHERJEE,JEAN-FREDERIC LEVESQUE

In many cases they do not reach the targeted group(s). This paper examines the trends in fertiliser subsidy and issues of equity in its distribution between farmers and the industry, across regions/states, crops and different farm sizes. The study shows that fertiliser subsidy is more concentrated in a few states and interstate disparity in its distribution is still high though it has declined over the years. A fair degree of equity exists in the distribution of fertiliser subsidy among farm sizes. Based on the results, this paper justifies fertiliser subsidies and questions the rationale for a direct transfer of subsidy to farmers.||VIJAY PAUL SHARMA,HRIMA THAKER

This paper verifies those two predictions for the Indian electronics hardware industry. It finds that despite liberalisation, the performance with respect to partial and total productivity of the electronics hardware industry was dismal.

It finds two major features of a rising inequality in urban areas: (a) even with a doubling of per capita consumption growth in the post-reform decade, the decline in poverty was less by a quarter compared to the pre-reform decade, and (b) in the post-reform period, the growth of the wage rate of regular workers was negative up to the 50th percentile of wage earnings, and beyond that point, wage rate growth turned positive and rose sharply to reach 5% per annum in highest quintile of wage earnings.||SANDIP SARKAR,BALWANT SINGH MEHTA

The CCC made a broad-based effort to move the debate away from the violence-counter violence question and to centre stage the democratic aspirations of the people in the violence-torn rural areas of Telangana. Although the effort came to an abrupt end after talks between the government and the Naxalites broke down in early 2005, the experience of the CCC and the core principles of the action it pursued during those eight years can give pointers to the challenges and possibilities that civil society actors face in the current conflict.||ANANT MARINGANTI

It explains its origins and popularity, and its current ubiquitous presence on menus in Indian restaurants. The history of this soup is a story of class struggle at the level of the dinner table and it is a story, inevitably, about gender.||MODHUMITA ROY

Since "rights" are guarantors of welfare gains, every winning of rights likewise strengthens them. The acquisition of rights on the part of the people, including rights to minimum bundles of goods, services and security, amounts therefore to winning crucial battles in the class war for the transcendence of capitalism. If the left were to put on its agenda a struggle for people's rights and adopt a rights-based approach to development as opposed to the means-based approach of the bourgeois formations, it would not constitute a retreat into abstract humanism but would be an integral part of the dialectics of subversion of the logic of capital.||PRABHAT PATNAIK

It argues that targeting is inefficient and inequitable. In India, this situation is largely an outcome of the bureaucratic raj, which has created a vast system of clogged pipes. While successive governments have dismantled state controls and interventions for the private sector, delivery of services, especially to the poor, is still firmly controlled by the same bureaucratic system, with its attendant problems. Given the limitations of targeting, the principle of universalism is worth considering as an alternative.||RENANA JHABVALA,GUY STANDING

This paper examines various puzzles of the research methodology of women's studies. It argues that the research methodology of women's studies cannot be a facile one. It needs a further advance to say under what conditions a woman can negotiate her terms. Along with intra-household studies, it has to supplement inter-household relations.

While legal entitlement to citizenship under the laws of the land is a necessary condition, by itself it does not suffice for the individual to feel the full power and potential of citizenship. Other complementary factors such as rights, capacity, sentiments, and moral obligations enhance the sense of citizenship. A sample survey of 8,000 citizens shows a widely dispersed sense of citizenship that largely overcomes the differences resulting from social class, ethnicity, religion, gender and generation. However, the underlying variance, particularly at the level of citizenship across India's regions, reveals the political limits of the Indian model and the scope for policies at extending citizenship to sections of the population that are outside its reach.||SUBRATA MITRA

The new political common sense is that this is the outcome of an intrusion by the judiciary into areas it had no business entering, and a concurrent abdication of responsibility by the executive and legislature. The government has taken the onus of tidying up the mess, but this job is unlikely to be easy, given that it needs the judicial imprimatur at every step.

This paper focuses on the recent developments in the weather insurance market and evaluates the performance of the Weather-based Crop Insurance Scheme in India. Through a micro-analysis of indemnity payouts under the traditional and the weather insurance schemes, the study reveals the much larger spread of benefits under the latter, thus significantly reducing a prominent drawback of the decades-old area yield scheme. While the product has tremendous potential to emerge as a sustainable crop insurance model that can meet the risk management needs of the rural poor, there are critical issues that merit action to achieve the desired results.||RESHMY NAIR

ILO's Work in Fishing Convention, 2007||After a gap of 40 years the International Labour Organisation has adopted a new labour instrument â€” Work is Fishing Convention, 2007 (No 188) â€” for fishers on board fishing vessels through three discussions at the International Labour Conference between 2004 and 2007. Contrary to the earlier practice of a compartmentalised approach to fishing labour standards, a consolidated approach has been achieved by ILO in adopting this convention. In a single legal instrument it provides flexible and prescriptive standards with respect to minimum requirements for fishing, conditions of service, accommodation and food, occupational safety and health and social security. The scope of the convention, also for the first time, includes all types of vessel-based fishing, both large and small. However, it does not deal with non-vessel based fishing activities. This article provides a backdrop to the employment and labour dimensions, and to earlier ILO labour standards of relevance to fishing. It discusses the process which led to the adoption of the Work in Fishing Convention, 2007 and its salient aspects. Being an important instrument in establishing principles and criteria and in proposing a mechanism to improve labour conditions related to fishing, the article argues that the ILO member-states, in consultation with representative organisations of fishing vessel owners and fishers, should initiate a process to ratify the convention, develop national legislation to implement, and to apply its provisions, as appropriate, to benefit all fishers.||SEBASTIAN MATHEW

Errors made in forecasting Indian growth a year ahead are similar in magnitude to those made for industrialised countries, but current-year forecasts errors are larger. This may reflect more the greater scale of variation in Indian growth as well as challenges posed by the large revisions in the official real gross domestic product data. The speed with which forecasters of India's growth absorb new information compares favourably with performance in industrialised countries: domestic news is absorbed into forecasts within four months and news from other countries such as the United States and China within six to seven months. There is great similarity between the Asia-Pacific Consensus Forecasts and International Monetary Fund forecasts for India.||KAJAL LAHIRI,PRAKASH LOUNGANI

It could be that since the current surge in capital flows to developing countries is causing problems, the IMF possibly does not want to be seen as having made the mistake of opposing capital controls as a means to manage excessive inflows. It has still to forget the criticism it faced when its intervention in the east Asian crisis exacerbated the downturn.

Both partial and total factor productivity measures are employed. Our analysis reveals that labour productivity has increased for the organised sector overtime, whereas both labour productivity and capital intensity growth have slowed down in the unorganised sector during the period between 2000-01 and 2004-05. The improvement in TFP growth in organised manufacturing in the post-2000 period as compared to the second half of the 1990s across most states in India is heartening as also the fact that output growth was mostly productivity-driven in the post-reform period. However, the declining TFP and the increasing capital intensity of the unorganised sector are causes of worry and raise several important questions.||VINISH KATHURIA,RAJESH RAJ S N,KUNAL SEN

Conventional social science accounts stress politico-economic variables, particularly the need for capital accumulation. By means of a detailed analysis of the Bhadravati Iron Works, an ambitious industrial project in the state of Mysore in colonial India, it is demonstrated that mechanisms are also important in state-led development. Locational disadvantages, technical problems, and increased production costs made the iron plant an unprofitable venture from its inception. The state, however, kept the plant operational on grounds of its pedagogic value for local society. A claim for civilisational recognition for India's capacity for development, which was expressed from within the conceptual parameters of mercantilist, social evolutionist and orientalist thought, provides the cultural logic of the developmental state in Mysore.||CHANDAN GOWDA
10/7/2010-16/7/2010||special article||40736731||The Analytics of Changing Growth Rates||A vast amount of research has asked how and why the growth rates in the Indian economy have risen in recent decades. Implicit in much of that literature is the belief that if the growth rate has increased it must be because something underlying has changed -had some parameters embedded in the "structure" of the economy not changed, the growth rate would have been constant. This is, however, a presumption that may not be true. The search for structural "breaks" is the outcome of a preoccupation with steady states and constant rates of growth. To redress the balance this article provides some simple examples of models in which the rate of growth is never constant but changes endogenously over time. The lesson therefore is that changes in the growth rate have no necessary link with changes in the underlying economic regime or economic structure. This is not an India-specific point but is based on a general analytical argument.||AMITAVA BOSE,SUBHASANKAR CHATTOPADHYAY

Capitalist development cannot take place without colonial or neocolonial exploitation. In the absence of external colonies or neocolonies, capitalism tries to create internal colonies, but they are not enough for full-fledged modern industrial development, which requires both exploitation of labour and the plunder and destruction of natural resources on a global scale.

In effecting change, India must be aware that (a) the financial sector and its reform is not an end in itself, (b) the risks are amplified if the reforms in the fiscal and real sectors are not in consonance with the pace of reform in financial sector regulation, and (c) the highest priority should be accorded to efficient intermediation of domestic saving and investment with a wide participation of the people of India.

How should it be redeveloped to remove the ugliness and yet retain its community spirit, enterprise, ambitions and hope? Current plans are focused on profit-making, by developers and government, with the welfare of the residents an incidental nuisance. This article examines the many attendant constraints in developing viable solutions. One is the promise of free pucca housing for slum-dwellers, which seems to have become a given for all slum redevelopment schemes in Mumbai. Another is the fact that Dharavi already has the highest living densities in the world, and redevelopment of the kind that is proposed will triple these densities, making living there unviable. The result could be that the present residents will sell out and flee, leaving Dharavi in the hands of high-income occupants living at more comfortable densities. An alternative would be to provide the essential infrastructure of water supply and sanitation, frame rules for redevelopment, and leave it to organisations of the residents themselves to take up reconstruction as and when they wish, in consonance with an overall plan.||SHIRISH B PATEL

According to official life tables constructed by the Registrar General, there is a stagnating trend in infant mortality and an increasing trend in female child mortality for India. The ratio of child mortality rates to infant mortality rates obtained from the official life tables for the recent period does not follow any of the model life table patterns, which raises questions about the reliability of these rates. Using age-specific death rates from the SRS, new life tables constructed for the most recent period show lower levels of child mortality rates compared to those provided by the SRS.||NANDITA SAIKIA,ABHISHEK SINGH,FAUJDAR RAM
18/12/2010-24/12/2010||special articles||25764242||Ethnicity, Caste and Religion: Implications for Poverty Outcomes||In the factors that affect income and poverty outcomes, there are some features unique to India. Caste, ethnicity, religion and even regional origins all influence income outcomes. Therefore while examining individual poverty, the influence of social belongings on the level and the nature of access to economic endowments and the individual's ability to utilise them freely are of considerable significance. This paper examines to what extent some ethnic, religious and caste minorities suffer from chronic impoverishment, especially in rural India. What economic endowments are owned by whom and by how much? What is the level of education and occupational skill across different social groups? The analysis is based on the 61st round (2004-05) of the National Sample Survey Organisation's Consumption-Expenditure Survey.||AMIT THORAT

An accepted principle of Islamic jurisprudence holds that fatwas must be related and responsive to the social and temporal context which they intend to address.

Those who say that it is time for the dollar to go, are not basing their argument on the greater strength of another currency to replace the dollar. Rather, the most popular alternative is the Special Drawing Right of the International Monetary Fund, which is more a unit of account than a currency and whose value is itself linked to that of a weighted basket of four major currencies. There are three implications of such an argument. First, even when the weakness of the US and the dollar is accepted, the case is not that the dollar should be completely displaced, since even in the basket that constitutes the SDR the dollar commands an influential role. Second, there is no other country or currency that is at present seen as being capable of taking the place of the US and the dollar at least in the near future. And, third, the search is not for a currency that can be used with confidence as a medium for international exchange, but for a derivative asset that investors can hold without fear of a substantial fall in its value when exchange rates fluctuate, because its value is defined in terms of and is stable relative to a basket of currencies.||C P CHANDRASEKHAR

As domination becomes unbearable, women have raised their voices and transgressed the boundaries set for them. Sometimes transgression has been expressed through mundane acts like challenging dress codes, veiling and cross-dressing, acts that give shape to their lives. The essay looks at the diverse constructions of women's bodies across castes, classes, regions, religions and other categories. Running through this is the role of the women's movement in dismantling these notions of the body. It then deals with the struggles and shifts in the understanding of the body over the decades. This is reflected in the campaigns undertaken by feminists along with voices from other movements. Finally, the paper places the complex unresolved concerns raised by the interface of feminists with movements of each of the marginalised peoples.||SABALA,MEENA GOPAL

It may be that some reasonably dispassionate history based on recorded texts and academic research will help understand the reasons for past policy decisions that affect current political sentiment in Andhra Pradesh. In many ways the sentiments of the people of Telangana are no different than those of the former Andhra state who fought so long and hard to separate their region from the Tamil-dominated Madras Province. Yet the same political elite which fought for an Andhra state and, then for Andhra Pradesh, seemed not to have learnt that it is not fair or sensible to "do unto others what you do not wish done unto you".

However, this did not protect the US and the world from the financial and economic crisis of 2007-08. The paper throws light on the ongoing debate about the completeness of the central bank's reaction function, highlighting the need to explicitly incorporate asset bubbles in it. The essay also discusses and critiques the Fed's current stance towards asset prices, and argues for a role for monetary policy in containing asset bubbles before they burst, even if inflation is not a threat in the near term. Further, it examines the weak effects of asset price movements on the Indian economy, obviating the need to use monetary policy to address the bubbles.||VANDANA SINGHVI PATEL

If the objective was to tackle the most egregious excesses of a wildly out-of-control sector, the bill that will eventually emerge is a reasonable effort. If the goal, however, is to conceive of and develop a 21st century financial sector that is an aid to the real economy and that assists in creating widespread prosperity, then this effort should be seen as a cynical attempt that will fail to do the needful. Proponents of this view suggest that the approach adopted has been regulatory as opposed to structural. The reform process has progressed as if the fundamental problem was a lack of prudential regulations as opposed to the actual social functioning of the financial system in the us.||ARJUN JAYADEV

There needs to be phased progress in four areas: (1) enactment of public health acts to provide the basic legislative underpinning for public health action; (2) establishment of separate public health directorates with their own budgets and staff; (3) revitalisation of public health cadre; and (4) health department engagement in ensuring municipal public health.||MONICA DAS GUPTA,B R DESIKACHARI,RAJENDRA SHUKLA,T V SOMANATHAN,P PADMANABAN,K K DATTA

This is particularly evident in the states with the conurbations of Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata, while states with smaller urban centres have fared better. This paper presents the estimates for urban areas at the all-India level and the individual states. The official method has been underestimating actually existing urban poverty in the same manner that rural poverty has been underestimated. The energy intake accessible at the all-India official urban poverty line has fallen to 1,795, but in many states it is below 1,450 calories at the state-specific official poverty lines. The data also record a small decline in average protein intake and a small rise in fat intake per capita over the same period.||UTSA PATNAIK

We use a national rural panel household data set, based on household surveys conducted by the National Council of Applied Economic Research in three rounds in 1970, 1981 and 1998. It examines the trends in the incidence of poverty in India from a longitudinal perspective. The study corroborates the view that the period of 1990s experienced a slower decline in poverty compared to the previous decade, although the incidence of chronic poverty declined even in the latter period. It also examines the pattern of growth in consumption expenditure to understand how it tracks trends in poverty.||NIDHI DHAMIJA,SHASHANKA BHIDE

This essay brings out these debates in terms of the disproportionality caused by the disparate rates of industrial and agricultural growth. It examines the continued relevance of the agriculture-industry linkage to understand the stagnation in the farm sector since the early 1990s. Instead of focusing on agriculture per se, the discussion attempts therefore to unravel the links that bind agriculture and industry, both analytically and empirically for India.||RAJIV JHA

Yet putting together the few written records available with some intelligent conjecture, it is reasonable to conclude that his three and a half years in the German capital had a decisive influence on the development of his mindset, his habits and his affinities as a grown-up man. His exposure to an education system and society that had no parallel to what he was familiar with widened his mental horizon and contributed to making him the holistic thinker he was.||JOACHIM OESTERHELD

But a look at disaggregated data shows that the growth has been based almost entirely on the public works programme, which boosted state output in construction during the boom in that sector from 2004-05 to 2006-07. Despite this, value added in construction seems overestimated, given the infirmities in estimation methods. Further, there has been no measurable multiplier effect of this infrastructural investment on the rest of the Bihar economy.||R NAGARAJ,ANDALEEB RAHMAN

A study of six villages in the lower Bhavani Basin in Tamil Nadu reveals that despite a strong willingness on the part of farmers to adopt agricultural best management practices, inadequate infrastructure and the high transaction costs involved in accessing such services make them reluctant to test soil samples regularly. This paper looks at the institutional, infrastructural and agronomic factors influencing farmers' willingness, and concludes that the new policy needs to be supplemented with basic agricultural extension services through public-private partnerships.||SACCHIDANANDA MUKHERJEE

To avoid crop losses due to frequent floods many farmers have adopted a risk-averse strategy by an appropriate combination of crops. This has led to a decline in the acreage share of kharif foodgrains and a corresponding increase in rabi foodgrains and vegetables. This article explores if such a strategy is spread over the whole state or is restricted to a few pockets. It also analyses how and to what extent flood proneness has influenced the choice of cropping pattern of the farmers of Assam.||RAJU MANDAL

On the other hand, a feminist perspective suggests that they reinforce colonial and patriarchal values. Using insights from feminist methodology, this article seeks to analyse this dichotomy. According to feminist legal theory, the legal subject is not an abstract, gender-neutral creature of the traditional legal imagination but an ideological construct, endowed with attributes that vary according to context. Between 1956 and 2009, four Law Commission reports addressed the issue of rape. However, it is noteworthy that there has been little to no change in Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code since 1860 when Thomas Macaulay drafted the code. The controversial issue of consent has not been defined or broadened, nor have the various nuances associated with it recognised. The law ministry has not accepted the terminological and paradigmatic shift from rape to sexual assault.||RUKMINI SEN

During the independence struggle, dalit writers, under Gandhian influence, touched upon casteism and untouchability but imitated mainstream writing in form and content. From the mid-1980s, however, dalit angst, protest and an alternative vision started reflecting in Telugu literature. Writers of the Dandora movement, for example, who belong to the Mediga caste, have begun adding the caste name to their surnames, a practice hitherto followed only by the upper castes. Madigas are placed so low in the hierarchy that the term is considered an abuse and its usage can attract the provisions of the Atrocities Act. This group also writes about the "satellite castes" who are considered untouchable even by the Madigas. Telugu dalit writing would have truly come of age when even these castes â€“ the ostracised among the ostracised â€“ begin writing about themselves.||K PURUSHOTHAM

It was taken up and crafted into an identity in the competitive politics of late colonial Assam by representatives of tribal groups who successfully welded this diverse set into a unified political and social category. This article traces the emergence of the "Plains Tribal" in the political map of Assam and shows how it came to be defined partly in opposition to other competing social categories and partly in terms of internal markers of identity.||SURYASIKHA PATHAK

Nevertheless, contradictory views have been expressed regarding the importance of this investment pattern for India's economic growth. This paper evaluates the impact of the rise in India's investment rate on its economic growth, using the neoclassical growth model. It finds that the increases in the investment rate have been a secondary source of growth, contributing less than 1 percentage point to India's overall growth rate of GDP per worker of 2.7%. It also shows that the current investment boom will have a very small effect on future growth rates and that the benefits from further increases in the investment rate are also likely to be small.||PETER E ROBERTSON

However, currently only 30% of the targeted villages receive regular water supplies, less than 20% of the canal network has been constructed and power generation remains well below the generation capacity reached. Even as the dam construction nears completion, rehabilitation of several thousand families is poor or incomplete. This, for a project that has had clearly laid out legal mandates to alleviate human and environmental costs, and has been under continuous public scrutiny and Supreme Court monitoring. The performance of this project does not seem very different from other Indian major irrigation and power projects: while main civil works somehow get completed, infrastructure and efforts necessary to realise benefits of the projects remain incomplete. The experience of people displaced by the Sardar Sarovar Project is fairly consistent with the experiences of millions displaced by other projects across the country, wherein the State uses the colonial Land Acquisition Act to dispossess people from their homes, lands and livelihoods, and consistently refuses to create just resettlement and rehabilitation entitlements and accountability frameworks to enable restoration of their livelihoods and their dignity. Instead, it promotes cash compensation (often aggressively and violently) to make people give up their homes, villages, land and other natural resources.||S PARASURAMAN,HIMANSHU UPADHYAYA,GOMATHY BALASUBRAMANIAN

Based on a literature review of healthcare business media, policy documents and a few academic papers, this essay looks at the scope for medical tourism in India and situates it within the Asian context. It traces shifts in policy with the growth of a tertiary corporate health sector that is urban-centric, and subject to minimal regulation and monitoring. The State acts primarily as a steward. The essay also examines the implications of medical tourism for general medical care and how such policy shifts distort health systems. This analysis raises questions of accessibility, affordability, and ethics in medical care, and asks if it is sensible to promote medical tourism in a democratic welfare state, with poor public healthcare facilities for the masses.||SUNITA REDDY,IMRANA QADEER

Governments that are now ignorant of IT regulatory issues need to act soon on net neutrality so that the public internet remains in place.||PARMINDER JEET SINGH

							in the transfer of resources to states seem relatively very generous when
							compared to those of its predecessors. This paper looks at the issue from
							various angles, including the alternative options it could have used, and
							assesses their implications. In particular, it examines whether the
							commission's underlying rationale for resorting to grants-in-aid for a variety
							of purposes is justified in terms of actually giving states an additionality of
							resources and ensuring that the sums will be spent for what they are intended.
							It points out that the grants-in-aid have widened the scope for
							growth-enhancing social spending in the long run and constricting the insidious
							spread of centrally-sponsored schemes, which encroach on the domain of
							states.||NARAYAN VALLURI

The primary objective, however, is to estimate the cost of BR in India based on three recent compulsory mergers and two voluntary mergers. Evidence suggests that barring one compulsory merger, all other mergers yielded value. Compulsory mergers were found to be costlier than voluntary mergers, though the overall cost of the three compulsory merger cases was, by and large, neutral.||PRASHANT SARAN,TULASI GOPINATH

Movements such as third world feminism and "women of colour" have attempted to counter the hegemony of western feminist discourse by arguing for the recognition of "difference". In contemporary feminist perspectives on reproductive technology, it has become something of a truism to say that technologies are appropriated differently depending on the cultural context within which they are used. This paper is an attempt to understand the connections between feminisms as well as the feminist concepts that circulate in Australia and India. Through multisited feminism, it sees the differences more clearly by also understanding the threads that connect feminisms and multiple meanings that issues such as abortion and sex-selection can take on as they move through a range of political contexts.||VICTORIA LOBLAY

The preponderance of the party over the social space, the transformation of the party from a hegemonic force into a violative one and ultimately the ruptures in the "party-society" have all gone on to loosen the dominance of the Left Front in West Bengal. As marginalised civil society reasserts itself and as the opposition coalesces around the resentment engendered against the ruling coalition, a new kind of oppositional politics is emerging in West Bengal, possibly on identitarian lines.||DWAIPAYAN BHATTACHARYYA

Locke's concept of wasteland, as opposed to value-producing land, constituted a founding binary opposition that constructed how landscapes were categorised. The period under study covers the Permanent Settlement (1793), the Ryotwari Settlement of Bombay, and the India Forest Acts (1865 and 1878). It is shown as to how the categories of waste and productive land were applied to groups supposedly attached to different landscapes, ie, "tribes" and "castes". Associated with wildness, wilderness, and savagery in the 19th century, the category of wasteland also defined who would and who would not become most vulnerable to dispossession and/or enclosure.||JUDY WHITEHEAD

It is also clear that given their increasing numbers and plight, the state governmnet can no longer afford to neglect these women.

The committee's recommendations do not address the problems of petroleum pricing in their entirety and appear to be driven by the desire to give private sector refiners, originally set up for export of products, an entry into the domestic market under the garb of liberalising price of petrol and diesel. The petroleum sector in India needs tax rationalisation and not tax increases. The high incidence of taxes on the petroleum sector, relative to the gross domestic product, has a negative impact on issues such as access to energy services and development.||SURYA P SETHI

On the face of it, the Indigo movement was against the oppressive and unremunerative system of indigo cultivation. It was perceived by the ryot as a threat to his security of subsistence, but there was much more to it than that. It was an affront to the use of customary rights held by the peasant and was a constriction or denial of choice where earlier there was complete freedom to choose the crop for cultivation. For an adequate understanding of the Indigo movement and perhaps for the historiography of the Indian peasant movements in general, both political and moral economy approaches need to be taken into consideration.||SANJAY GHILDIYAL

Even as they organised the resistance to state repression, they put in place, at a rudimentary level, an alternative programme of development based on the people's initiative and their voluntary labour. But when the joint forces of the central and state governments moved into the area, the organisation of a people's militia became an imperative. There is a need to trace the roots of the armed resistance. The grudging Bengali urban literati need to understand that questions as to who is to lead and guide the movement and the form it should take are to be decided by the sons of the soil themselves, and not by those who keep a safe distance from it.||AMIT BHATTACHARYYA

Historically, Indian society has enjoyed considerable autonomy of the state, which itself shows the possibility of an Indian imaginary of civil society. The postcolonial experience of a liberal constitution, rights and democracy has made possible the emergence of a modern, but non-bourgeois civil society within our castes and communities. Thus, if political theory goes beyond describing the present to imagining and justifying more radical futures, the idea of political society seems to come in the way.||SANJEEB MUKHERJEE

On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the publication of the slender classic Production of Commodities by Means of Commodities: Prelude to a Critique of Economic Theory, this paper revisits the Sraffa treatise. It argues that Sraffa tried to build the foundation of an economic theory that is based on only given objective facts and which does not rely specifically on the notion of equilibrium of demand and supply and any hypothesis regarding human subjectivities such as utility functions or demand. This revolutionary project of Sraffa was lost due to a grave misunderstanding of his book by both his followers and critics, perhaps due to his cryptic style of writing but more importantly because of the dominance of the idea of equilibrium in economic theory. The aim of this paper is to rediscover the logic of Sraffa's theory of prices that does not take on board either the notion of equilibrium or demand.||AJIT SINHA

We draw on a unique survey designed and implemented by members of the dalit community to capture social practices and conditions important to them which are not featured in the usual household surveys. This survey asked all dalit households in two blocks of Uttar Pradesh (Azamgarh and Bulandshahar districts) both about conditions currently and in 1990. The survey results suggest that placing exclusive focus on measures of material well-being, such as consumption expenditure and its inequality, is misplaced as it misses important changes in socially structured inequalities and hence in individuals' functioning.||DEVESH KAPUR,CHANDRA BHAN PRASAD,LANT PRITCHETT,D SHYAM BABU

In order to prevent a possible appreciation of the currency, which would have had an adverse effect on the real sector of the economy, the Reserve Bank of India resorted to market intervention and the increase in the foreign exchange reserves, which would have caused a possible increase in the money supply, was neutralised by undertaking a "sterilisation" process. In the process, the RBI suffered a huge loss in its potential income and had to resort to a smaller transfer of funds to NABARD. On the other hand, NABARD, faced with an increasing demand for loans turned to open market borrowings at a higher interest rate, which ultimately led to a huge loss in its potential income. This paper finds that with the ongoing reforms, the banking system has not only sacrificed developmental aspects, but also failed to satisfy the profit norms of banking.||SHOUVIK CHAKRABORTY,ZICO DASGUPTA

This paper investigates, for the specific case of a federal country like India, whether differences between states in shares of public spending on health and education show convergence over time, and the impact of episodic horizontal partitioning of states on this process. Our analysis rejects the hypothesis that preferences for health across state level jurisdictions are becoming more uniform over time, but for education, there is evidence of convergence, albeit at a low rate.||AJAY MAHAL,INDIRA RAJARAMAN

They face various forms of discrimination, including job-typing that pushes them into low-paying jobs. Higher work participation per se does not lead to better outcomes unless accompanied by higher education, and/or assets. Education may not positively influence a woman's participation in work, but for women who are in the workforce, education is the most important determinant of better quality non-agricultural work. Women's autonomy, measured in terms of control over land, mobility, and a willingness to join self-help groups, enables them to move into non-agricultural jobs. The paper argues for policy interventions to increase work opportunities and enhance wages for rural women workers.||NISHA SRIVASTAVA,RAVI SRIVASTAVA

This paper attempts to draw on the critical literature to understand the role and meaning of neoliberalism, particularly in the context of the rural drinking water reforms in Maharashtra. While the influence of neoliberalism cannot be understood as something that determines the course of the reforms in an absolute sense, its varied and often insidious channels of operation imply that its influence cannot be taken lightly either. This, in turn, has implications for the kind of political position that one takes on the reforms as well as for future research directions.||PRIYA SANGAMESWARAN

Increasing water storage is a key adaptation strategy, and the experience of irrigation tanks illustrates both the potential and challenges of this adaptation response. Although there are over 2,08,000 tanks in India, irrigating about 2.3 million hectares in 2000-01, the net area irrigated by tanks declined by 29% between 1990-91 and 2000-01 and by 32% between 2001 and 2008. This paper reviews the challenges faced by tank irrigation and examines options for improving their performance -revenue mobilisation through multiple use of tanks, augmenting groundwater resources in the tanks, integrating social forestry and desilting, and tank modernisation.||K PALANISAMI,RUTH MEINZEN-DICK,MARK GIORDANO

The item number is a cine-segment comprising an item-girl/boy, a racy song, a vivacious dance and a surround of erotic and immanent exuberance. At one remove from the cinema hall, item numbers circulate as video clips and off-screen performances that recreate the cinesexual in social life. At this second level, the item number, re-fashioned through spectacular familial and social practices of the middle classes, draws its sense from diverse, gendered and changing micro-contexts of cine-heterosexuality.||RITA BRARA

The issue has been highlighted by Deaton and DrÃ¨ze (EPW, 14 February 2009). They find it puzzling that according to the NFHS, the prevalence of child malnutrition as measured by weight for age was almost unaltered between 1998-99 and 2005-06, while NNMB estimates suggest a substantial decline. This article undertakes a more detailed assessment of these two sets of estimates and finds that once the comparison is confined to comparable units, the difference is largely eliminated.||PETER SVEDBERG

In the context of the Supreme Court verdict of 21 July 2009, which rejected a stay order by the Kerala High Court on important sections of the Kerala Restriction on Transfer by and Restoration of Lands to Scheduled Tribes Act, 1999 and the new scenario where the legislature and the judiciary proclaim that the adivasi community has now agreed for alternate land, and therefore, the issue of restoration of land has become irrelevant, this study looks into the story of Aralam farm in Kannur district, where a rehabilitation programme by the state is currently in progress. This study reveals the grim reality of the dalits and adivasi people in a state, where no territory is declared as a scheduled area under the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution.||M S SREEREKHA

Rethinking the Role of Affirmative Action||This paper explores how an individual's participation in higher education is dependent on her religious affiliations, socio-economic status and demographic characteristics. It argues that an appropriate measure of "deficits" in participation should inform the nature and scope of affirmative action. The study emphasises the relevance, both for analytical examination and in policy formulation, of distinguishing between stock and flow measures of participation and of recognising the differences (or imbalances) in the eligibility for higher education across groups. On isolating the effect of socio-religious affiliation from other factors that may influence participation in higher education, what emerges is a suggestion that the deficits faced by some marginalised groups are not substantial. If reservation policy for these groups is to be justified only on the basis of low participation, it may require a review.||RAKESH BASANT,GITANJALI SEN

This question becomes important in the light of the recent United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which India has signed and ratified. This paper discusses two major aspects of the UN Disabilities Convention: first, the intermingling of positive and negative obligations, and, second, the introduction of the social model of disability. It examines the manner in which the international treaty obligations have been borrowed and relied upon by Indian courts. It also emphasises the important concepts, which can be borrowed from the UN Convention in order to strengthen disability law in India.||JAYNA KOTHARI

Targeted, unconditional cash transfers are little used, and have been hardly evaluated. An evaluation of cash transfers for the elderly and widows, based on the national household survey data and surveys on social pension utilisation in two, Karnataka and Rajasthan, reveals that these social pension schemes work reasonably well. Levels of leakage are low, funds flow disproportionately to poorer rather than richer households, and there is strong evidence that the funds reach vulnerable individuals. A comparison with the public distribution system reveals that the main strength of the social pensions scheme is its relatively low level of leakage. This paper hypothesises that social pensions suffer less from corruption than India's other safety net programmes either because of the low levels of discretion involved in their delivery or the small size of the transfers involved. Since we cannot choose between these two hypotheses, the scaling-up of the social pension schemes, currently underway while warranted, should be closely monitored.||PUJA DUTTA,STEPHEN HOWES,RINKU MURGAI

Regulation that induces better outcomes by creating correct incentives for market participants is the key to reform. A combination of micro- and macro-prudential regulation can moderate pro-cyclicality, information failure and market power. Global prudential standards can push financial firms to choose safe over risky strategies, by removing the moral hazard from bailouts, and assuring firms that competitors will not adopt risky strategies either. Universal application of basic standards can prevent regulatory arbitrage. A pure principles-based regulatory approach may be too flexible, but principle-based rules retain sufficient operational flexibility and universality.||ASHIMA GOYAL

The first was the M C Chagla Commission of Enquiry Report, which ultimately led to Jawaharlal Nehru accepting Krishnamachari's resignation. The second, the "Mundhra episode" was media managed with the encouragement of industrial interests who found that the controls established as part of the industrialisation drive accompanying the Second Five-Year Plan made serious and unacceptable inroads in private capitalist decision-making. The third development involved social engineering, a concerted effort to push the bearers of merchant and usurer capital towards industrial capitalist norms. This paper, based on contemporary records, argues that the more profound reasons for Krishnamachari's fall was the "Rama Rau affair" of late 1956. It holds that the institutional subordination of the Reserve Bank of India was intended to mould monetary policy to the requirements of industrial development. It concludes that Krishnamachari tripped in attempting to coerce street-smart businessmen in control of industry to behave like true industrialists.||NASIR TYABJI

While hiring conditions, tenure, remuneration, and qualifications vary considerably across states, the use of para-teachers has generated debate about their impact on the quality of elementary education. Based on a critical literature review of available studies and new evidence from the SchoolTELLS survey conducted by the authors and their collaborators, this paper summarises the proof regarding the functioning and impact of para-teachers in elementary schools in India. None of the studies reviewed evaluates the causal impact of para-teachers, but they do suggest that despite poorer training, para-teachers may be more cost-effective than regular teachers. The questions of career progression and equity for teachers, nonetheless, also need to be addressed.||GEETA GANDHI KINGDON,VANDANA SIPAHIMALANI-RAO

There is now clear evidence from the National Sample Survey quinquennial household consumer expenditure surveys conducted in 1993-94 and 2004-05 that increased distance between urban elites (owners, managers and professionals), rural rentier classes (such as moneylenders and absentee landlords) that are more stratified at the top, and unskilled urban workers, marginal farmers and agricultural workers, who are increasingly more stratified at the bottom, helps us understand the distributional dynamics of the Indian growth story.

(2) The next decade will see at least one major financial crisis affecting a large part of the world economy, because (a) the effort to re-regulate the financial system has largely failed; (b) income distribution will continue to become more polarised, with the top 1% lifting further from the median; (c) global payments imbalances will continue at levels where the associated capital flows keep the level of financial fragility dangerously high.||ROBERT H WADE

Nuclear Ambivalence and the Contradictions of Non-Proliferation Policy||This paper argues that the limit of conventional non-proliferation policy analysis is marked by the inability to come to terms with the ambivalence of nuclear power. Ambivalence is often glossed over in the literature as "dual use" technology; the "dual use" formulation misleadingly transfers attention to the operator or manager of technology rather than see it as a structural feature of the technology itself. By contrast, this paper argues that ambivalence is not a choice under the control of good or bad leaders. Regardless of "good" or "bad" technological choices made at different points of time, the ambivalence of nuclear technology does not go away. Two cases are explored to assess the impact of nuclear ambivalence on non-proliferation policy: the declarations by North Korea and India that they are nuclear weapons states. In both cases, this paper shows, international policymakers assumed long before the actual decisions were taken that these countries intended to build nuclear arsenals. The international community took "appropriate" action, namely, a coordinated policy of sanctions and technology denial, based on this unverifiable conclusion. This approach had the unintended consequence of reducing the costs of each country's eventual decision to "go" nuclear.||ITTY ABRAHAM

Subsidies are believed to be ubiquitous in public expenditure. Estimates of sectoral/service-level subsidy, however, are based on a notion of unrecovered cost. This paper discusses the estimates of the annualised budgetary cost of and recovery from four public services, namely, drinking water, irrigation, power and road transport in Rajasthan between 1990-91 and 2006-07. An aggregate under-recovery in these (four) public services, as a proportion of gross state domestic product, appears to be ratcheting up gradually. Irrigation and power, constituting more than 80% of aggregate under-recovery, depict wider inequity in spread of benefits from public expenditure. Further, sectors constituting a relatively small proportion of aggregate under-recovery, namely, drinking water and road transport, are biased against the relatively poor. Worse, in the case of road transport, revenue from such taxes far exceeds estimated under-recovery. It also highlights the growing tendency of tax-based financing and lackadaisical approach towards pricing of public services.||MUKESH ANAND

It estimates an exchange-rate-augmented Taylor rule for India over the period Quarter 1 of 1980 to Quarter 4 of 2008. It investigates monetary policy changes between the pre- and post-liberalisation periods in order to capture the potential impact of macroeconomic structural changes on the RBI'S monetary policy conduct. Overall, if finds that the output gap seems to matter more to RBI than inflation, there is greater sensitivity to consumer price inflation, exchange rate changes do not constitute an important policy factor, and the post-1998 conduct of monetary policy seems to have changed in the direction of less inertia.||MICHAEL M HUTCHISON,RAJESWARI SENGUPTA,NIRVIKAR SINGH

It has not only been challenged intermittently but also contested as a unifying concept. From the historical point of view, the emergence of the current separate Telangana movement of Andhra Pradesh is testimony to the failure or even death of regional historiography or history consciousness, out of which the Telugu people's identity once sought to evolve. The historical understanding of a small group of Telugu intellectuals under colonialism finally developed into an imagined common historiography of the Telugus as Andhras. Giving the name "Andhra" to the Telugu region in the 20th century was arbitrary and was due to the intervention of a new historical consciousness emerging among Telugu intellectuals. From the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century, describing the Telugu people as Andhras and the Telugu region as the Andhra region was not a simple matter of naming. It was an example of a particular historical interpretation that was rooted in colonialism and modernisation. The history of a separate Telangana movement, in a sense, follows a process to bid farewell to the colonial legacy of a modern intellectual tradition formed around regional language and history.||YAMADA KEIKO

What is left out is probably more important than what it contains. The so-called deal, which the governments only "took note of" and was not adopted, does not mention any figures for emission reduction that the developed countries are to undertake after 2012. However, the larger failure was that while Copenhagen should have been designed as a stepping stone, and not as a final conclusion, western political leaders tried to hijack the legitimate multilateral process of negotiations that had been taking place before Copenhagen and at Copenhagen itself. What the world ended up with was a disaster of a meeting and a document.||MARTIN KHOR

"Unity in diversity", the motto of Indian federalism, evokes the image of colourful regional identities woven around a strong national core. But the celebration of the nation state, which is said to have emerged in the face of "daunting odds", is indicative of how little coincidental the choice of words has been in the praise of Indian federalism: Unity comes first, diversity follows. Picking up on new trends in international and constitutional law, this article argues that the introduction of a secession clause in the Constitution will be conducive to breathing new life into the debate on the division of labour between the centre and the states. Breaking with the taboo of static, irreversible borders and opening the political space for discussing deviations from the territorial status quo may help generate a fresh commitment to constitutionalism and put a stop to the erosion of the Constitution's integrative power that is giving rise to secessionist claims in the first place.||PATRICK HOENIG

The super-rich now have an important voice in the formulation of government policies. The government has failed to fulfil the common minimum programme agenda on inclusiveness. Its claim to have raised substantially the aggregate tax-gross domestic product ratio does not stand the test of scrutiny. The credit needs of small borrowers from agriculture and small-scale industry remain unfulfilled.

16/10/2010-22/10/2010||special articles||20787474||Reinventing Development Economics||Development used to mean a process of structural transformation associated with gradual disappearance of dualism and surplus labour. Today it simply means growth of per capita income. This change of meaning reflects a paradigm shift in development economics; the Lewis framework has yielded place to a "monoeconomics" framework. The latter assumes away the structural differences between developing and developed economies, thereby eliminating the distinction between development and growth. Development economics then becomes concerned with explaining why some countries have remained so much poorer than others. The premises of this "new" framework, this paper argues, are highly questionable. Lewis' characterisation of developing economies as labour-surplus dual economies and conceptualisation of development as a process of structural change are far sounder. The paper uses Lewis' premises and the considerable benefit of hindsight to build a fresh perspective on issues, requirements and challenges of development.||AJIT K GHOSE

However, some key policy innovations such as Devaraj Urs' land reforms and pro-backward class policies in the 1970s owed a debt to Lohia. He was also a major influence on social and literary movements in the state. Besides inspiring some of the key leaders of the farmers' movement, Lohia contributed to the distinctiveness of the dalit movement in Karnataka. His ideas on caste, language and individual freedom also inspired the leading lights of Kannada literary modernism.

The first is the impact of the abysmal sex ratio, which is a result of rampant female sex selective abortions, neglect of girl children and a minuscule but still present female infanticide.

By using the stochastic frontier technique, it provides an idealised yardstick to evaluate the performance of the health sector. Carried out in two stages of estimation, the results of our model, using district-level panel data, indicate that the efficiency of the public health delivery system in Karnataka remains low. Considerable disparities across districts in per capita availability as well as utilisation of hospitals, beds and manpower inputs hamper improvements in life expectancy in the state. Results from the second stage of estimation suggest that in rural areas particularly, improvements in infrastructure facilities like safe drinking water supply, toilets and electricity as well as better coordination between social sector and economic policies, especially at the district level, may also help the state improve life expectancy speedily and more equitably in the deficient districts.||BRIJESH C PUROHIT

It also accepts a regressive bias in fiscal policy as part of the strategy. In the Union Budget, the government has restructured the tax system so as to curtail revenue expendituers, while maintaining past direct tax concessions and using a part of its revenues to provide new concessions that are expected to spur demand, sustain and increase corporate savings and encourage corporate investment, all with the intention of "facilitating" growth. The potentially "inequalising" fallout of such an approach is possibly seen as collateral damage in realising a high rate of market-driven (as opposed to state-driven) growth, which needs to be redressed separately â€” if at all it will be.||C P CHANDRASEKHAR

Kerala provides an appropriate setting to understand how far radical redistributive land reforms have succeeded in transforming inequity in landownership. Our findings based on a micro-level village study show that the much acclaimed land reforms have failed to provide land to the actual tillers of the soil. The scheduled castes still stand at the bottom in landownership. Such a situation is explained not only through land reforms, but also by a set of interlocking historical factors including commercialisation of agriculture, the Depression of the 1930s, migration, social reforms and demographic pressures.||SUMA SCARIA

Such a chronological emphasis sidelines the geographies involved, and the spaces integral to a nation during its ascent. This paper argues that the geographic dimension is the key to understanding the "individual" and "collective" rise of nations; a differentiation that gets blurred when spaces are assumed constant. It seeks to establish how geographies create the very paradigms in which ascendancies have emerged. For this purpose, the paper creates an alternative framework that factors in the impact of global spatial rearrangements on ascendancies. The temporal-historical sequence of the rise of nations remains the same. But using geography as a tool, it tries to deduce the logic behind such a sequence.

These benefits provided incentives to small entrepreneurs to formally register their enterprises.

There appears to be a sharp fall in the growth rate of employment in registered small enterprises around the time of liberalisation. A case study of Durgapur in West Bengal shows that while registration has a positive impact on profits for firms set up before liberalisation, no such trend exists for post-liberalisation firms.||MOUSUMI MAJUMDAR,SARBAJIT SENGUPTA

Known as "dabba" in local parlance, the online futures market was much maligned by traders who described it as "nothing but speculation". This paper argues that the criticisms made by these traders need to be taken seriously because this group forms the backbone of the agricultural marketing system in India and their lack of participation takes away from the credibility and completeness of information on the online futures market.||RICHA KUMAR
23/10/2010-29/10/2010||commentary||20787495||S R Sankaran: In Memoriam||S R Sankaran, the retired IAS officer, who died on 7 October was an extraordinary person who directly touched the lives of perhaps tens of thousands of people. As a civil servant he was deeply involved over the decades in the abolition of bonded labour and empowerment of the adivasis of Andhra Pradesh. He was also chief secretary of Tripura and at the centre he was involved with some major policy issues such as the nationalisation of coal in the 1970s. Position and power did not matter to Sankaran, the rights of the poor did. Post retirement, Sankaran remained as active as before: he was involved with a number of people's organisations, he headed a committee of concerned citizens to mediate between the government and the Naxalites in Andhra Pradesh, he worked with safai karmacharis to abolish this antediluvian practice and he was generally concerned with the threat to democratic rights. Two tributes.||E A S SARMA

Instead of being strengthened, the international climate regime was weakened by the now serious threat to close the legally binding and top-down Kyoto Protocol system and to replace it with a voluntary pledge system.||MARTIN KHOR

These volatility episodes have often created a penumbra of uncertainty around investment decisions. Surprisingly, the pronounced swing of opinion globally against unfettered capital account liberalisation in the light of the recent financial upheavals seems to have completely bypassed Indian policy circles. This article discusses various options for "capital management" that would contribute to growth with stability. These techniques comprise two complementary (and sometimes overlapping) sets of policies, viz, capital controls on inflows/outflows and prudential financial regulation.||D M NACHANE

A case in point is the Satyavadi School set up in Sakhigopal village, near Puri, in Orissa in 1909. It proposed an alternative and unconventional system of education autonomous of the colonial state that would train students in nationalism and in questioning orthodoxies. However, it was also dependent on the conservative sasani brahmins for resources and students and despite an excellent track record closed down in 1926.||PRITISH ACHARYA,SHRI KRISHAN

Reading the Archaeological 'Evidence'||As witnesses to a major part of the excavations carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India at the Ram janmabhoomi-Babri masjid site in Ayodhya in 2003, the authors detail the many irregularities and outdated methods they observed. They also refer to the objections they filed regarding some of the procedures followed by the ASI, as well as the objections to its Final Report on the excavations. In several ways, it was obvious that the ASI was operating with a preconceived notion of discovering the remains of a temple beneath the demolished mosque, even selectively altering the evidence to suit its hypothesis. The authors stress that there is little doubt that the kind of archaeology practised by the statist ASI, where archaeologists see themselves primarily as bureaucrats, suffers from a serious absence of academic engagement and training.||SUPRIYA VARMA,JAYA MENON

An examination of the Central Statistical Organisation data for the decade since 1999-2000, however, reveals a cyclical move towards a higher growth continuum rather than any structural break under the NDA government. The recent growth path represents the resumption of a long, fluctuating and volatile movement towards a trade-led higher growth continuum that had started in 1994-95 but was interrupted by the impact of bifurcation of Bihar in 2001. A preliminary proposition is that the process of movement to a higher growth continuum since 1994-95 in Bihar follows from the diversified patterns of accumulation through the agency of new entrants to accumulation as an outcome of the social justice movement in Bihar. The evidence presented here belies the propositions around a "growth miracle" under the NDA government and indicates a politically fractious movement of Bihar's economy since bifurcation to a volatile higher growth continuum that is lopsided in three dimensions â€” regional, sectoral and social.||CHIRASHREE DAS GUPTA

It argues that women workers have gained from the scheme primarily because of the paid employment opportunity, and benefits have been realised through incomeâ€”consumption effects, intraâ€”household effects, and the enhancement of choice and capability. Women have also gained to some extent in terms of realisation of equal wages under the NREGS, with longâ€”term implications for correcting gender skewness and gender discriminatory wages prevalent in the rural labour market of India. Despite the difficulties and hurdles for women, prospects lie, inter alia, in their collective mobilisation, more so in laggard states.||ASHOK PANKAJ,RUKMINI TANKHA

The customs and rituals under which girls are brought up and gendered into womanhood constitute a regime which is incompatible with the normative view of childhood implicit in child-centred policies of education. The evolution of the Indian state under colonialism has made it structurally predisposed towards the maintenance of patriarchy. Education can hardly be expected to interfere with gender asymmetry unless it is epistemologically reconceptualised with the help of a collective academic enterprise involving several different disciplines.||KRISHNA KUMAR

It is concerned with analysing how the IAASTD was designed and written, for what it can tell us about the conclusions drawn and controversies raised. The democratic practices underpinning the set of IAASTD reports and the integrated approach to agricultural knowledge, science, and technology, commodity production, and environmental and social goals, are central for understanding contemporary debates about agricultural knowledge.||SHELLEY FELDMAN,STEPHEN BIGGS,RAJESWARI RAINA

He discovered that villagers (even landless labourers) have agency in their own lives and that the cumulative weight of their decisions and actions could reshape regional and national policy in the colonial and post-colonial periods. He found that growing an expensive cash crop does not impoverish small farmers. These discoveries went contrary to conventional wisdom, contrary to a strong consensus among social scientists around the world, contrary to the teachings of Marx, Lenin, and big-name dependency theorists. Despite his confidence in the data, he needed a reality check. How could he test whether he had misunderstood the lessons from the villagers?||DONALD W ATTWOOD

The UID number that will be provided will be an enabler â€” a number that helps governments design better welfare programmes, enables residents to access resources more easily wherever they live, and allows agencies to deliver benefits and services effectively and transparently. The number will thus be an identity infrastructure, and the foundation over which multiple services and applications can be built for the resident. The article "A Unique Identity Bill" (EPW, 24 July 2010) reflects some fundamental misunderstandings on the objectives of the Unique Identity Authority of India, the features of the identity number, and the impact it will have on privacy.

Using data from the World Health Survey, India, 2003, covering a nationally representative sample of 10,750 households and 9,994 adults, this paper examines the extent of agreement of monthly per capita consumption expenditure and economic proxies (combined with the wealth index) with the differentials in health estimates according to two alternative measures. It finds that economic differentials in health and healthcare utilisation based on economic proxies are not similar to those of direct measures. There is an urgent need to integrate an abridged version of the consumption expenditure schedule in population-based health surveys. The results also indicate that the extent of agreement of the MPCE with the wealth index is weak. Only 31% of households are classified in the same quintile of MPCE and wealth index and the health estimates are sensitive to these two measures.||AKANKSHA SRIVASTAVA,SANJAY K MOHANTY

The silence by the upper caste feminist movements on marginalised femininities reinforces the notion of the homogeneity of Indian femininity. The corpus of works on sacred prostitution also reflects this notion. This article focuses on the outcaste ritual women who either as priestesses of temples or as moving shrines continue to be central to the religious cultural order in villages across parts of southern India. The fundamental challenge in writing the history of the outcastes is to make a paradigmatic shift and move beyond the history of pathos that defines the research on them.||PRIYADARSHINI VIJAISRI

But given a weak bourgeoisie, uneven development and the lack of a progressive third force, the elections, which are bound to witness the use of state patronage, would not mean much for the minorities or for the economically marginalised sections of Sri Lankan society.
