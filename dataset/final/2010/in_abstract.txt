This article provides an analysis of the imposition of capitalist property rights over natural resources in India as processes of primary accumulation. These processes are evidenced by the construction of large dams and mines, in addition to the proliferation of free market environmentalism. Moreover, the scope for primary accumulation remains substantial in view of the hydel potential and new circuits of accumulation emerge under the auspices of free market environmentalism. Are the desiderata of ecological sustainability and human development realised under the logic of primary accumulation and a neoliberal commitment to economic growth?||SIRISHA C NAIDU,PANAYIOTIS T MANOLAKOS

The gram sabha, the basic unit in the process of forest rights recognition, has been replaced by the gram sansad, denoting the village level constituency under the panchayati raj system. This has been followed by contiguous arrangements as well as initiatives which are inconsistent with the Act. All these factors have led to undermining the spirit of the Act to promote community governance of forests, which has invoked stiff opposition from forest dwellers in the region.||SOURISH JHA

Relying on a wide-ranging literature review, this article analyses the alleged impacts of such plantations, the protesters involved, and the modalities of the conflicts. It finds that the prominent cause of resistance is related to corporate control over land resulting in displacement and the end of local uses of ecosystem resources. Resistance includes the "weapons of the weak" and ranges from dialogue to direct confrontation. Authorities have responded by repression in half of the cases reported, while popular struggles have been successful in about one-fifth. These movements can be understood as forms of the "environmentalism of the poor".||JULIEN-FRANÇOIS GERBER

Maghai, the landless untouchable farmer and water diviner in Mahasweta Devi's Water written in 1972 continues Hori's tale of despair. The story explores the interweaving of the dynamics of rural poverty with the machinations of the local landed elite in collusion with local officials and the police. The village teacher and Maghai's son are both aware of the corruption but are afraid to protest too loudly for fear of being arrested as Naxalites. In view of the reports of fraud and corruption in the functioning of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in many villages, this article looks at the different forms of cheating practised in the name of providing relief to the poor with specific reference to Devi's story.||VANASHREE

Kaiga and Other Nuclear Stories||The November 2009 exposure of employees at the Kaiga nuclear power plant to tritiated water is not the first instance of high radiation exposures to workers. Over the years, many nuclear reactors and other facilities associated with the nuclear fuel cycle operated by the Department of Atomic Energy have had accidents of varying severity. Many of these are a result of repeated inattention to good safety practices, often due to lapses by management. Therefore, the fact that catastrophic radioactive releases have not occurred is not by itself a source of comfort. To understand whether the DAE'S facilities are safe, it is therefore necessary to take a closer look at their operations. The description and discussion in this paper of some accidents and organisational practices offer a glimpse of the lack of priority given to nuclear safety by the DAE. The evidence presented here suggests that the organisation does not yet have the capacity to safely manage India's nuclear facilities.||M V RAMANA,ASHWIN KUMAR

Questions of the conformity of Indian projects to the provisions of the treaty can indeed arise, but the agreement provides institutional mechanisms for dealing with them. By presenting a "non-paper" to India about its concerns on the sharing of river waters, Pakistan is therefore setting out on a dangerous path that could have major implications.

This paper presents an account of how these actors positioned themselves around not only the creation of the tiger reserve, but also the proposed elephant corridor and the Forest Rights Act of 2006. It suggests that due process of law has not been followed adequately and that sufficient scientific evidence has not been presented in the public domain as required. The Forest Rights Act is seen to offer an opportunity to democratise the management of natural resources with all its social and ecological complexities and provide the necessary checks and balances to bring about conservation based strongly on scientific evidence.||DANIEL TAGHIOFF,AJIT MENON

In an attempt to understand the multilayered articulation of the demand for a separate Telangana, we decided to speak to a cross section of people on their participation and their aspirations — people across political formations and social backgrounds. Our travels took us to small farmers, pastoralists, intellectuals, coal miners, schoolteachers, weavers, traders and dhobis; Muslim, adivasi, dalit and student leaders; we attended meetings in adivasi hamlets, in working class urban neighbourhoods and we visited shibirams (tents) across the region and spoke to people on relay hunger strikes. We see quite clearly the emergence of a new politics that is committed to deliberating over the meanings of democracy and direct action. People's demand for Telangana elaborates a complex set of arguments in relation to investment, employment, education, land, water, and resources. But more importantly it has to do with self-rule, dignity and self-respect, which are the fundamental premises of the Telangana movement. The separate state is seen as only the first step towards democratisation.||KALPANA KANNABIRAN,SAGARI R RAMDAS,N MADHUSUDHAN,S ASHALATHA,M PAVAN KUMAR

How should it be redeveloped to remove the ugliness and yet retain its community spirit, enterprise, ambitions and hope? Current plans are focused on profit-making, by developers and government, with the welfare of the residents an incidental nuisance. This article examines the many attendant constraints in developing viable solutions. One is the promise of free pucca housing for slum-dwellers, which seems to have become a given for all slum redevelopment schemes in Mumbai. Another is the fact that Dharavi already has the highest living densities in the world, and redevelopment of the kind that is proposed will triple these densities, making living there unviable. The result could be that the present residents will sell out and flee, leaving Dharavi in the hands of high-income occupants living at more comfortable densities. An alternative would be to provide the essential infrastructure of water supply and sanitation, frame rules for redevelopment, and leave it to organisations of the residents themselves to take up reconstruction as and when they wish, in consonance with an overall plan.||SHIRISH B PATEL

The problem is that of evolving shared modalities of dealing with and sharing water surpluses and shortfalls. This is an aspect that the water disputes tribunals provide no guidelines on because they see water only in terms of legal property to be apportioned.

We analyse the central government's policies and then describe Tamil Nadu's public health system, which offers basic principles for strengthening public health within the administrative and fiscal resources available to most states. We suggest establishing a public health focal point in the health ministry, and revitalising the states' public health managerial and grassroots cadres. There needs to be phased progress in four areas: (1) enactment of public health acts to provide the basic legislative underpinning for public health action; (2) establishment of separate public health directorates with their own budgets and staff; (3) revitalisation of public health cadre; and (4) health department engagement in ensuring municipal public health.||MONICA DAS GUPTA,B R DESIKACHARI,RAJENDRA SHUKLA,T V SOMANATHAN,P PADMANABAN,K K DATTA

However, currently only 30% of the targeted villages receive regular water supplies, less than 20% of the canal network has been constructed and power generation remains well below the generation capacity reached. Even as the dam construction nears completion, rehabilitation of several thousand families is poor or incomplete. This, for a project that has had clearly laid out legal mandates to alleviate human and environmental costs, and has been under continuous public scrutiny and Supreme Court monitoring. The performance of this project does not seem very different from other Indian major irrigation and power projects: while main civil works somehow get completed, infrastructure and efforts necessary to realise benefits of the projects remain incomplete. The experience of people displaced by the Sardar Sarovar Project is fairly consistent with the experiences of millions displaced by other projects across the country, wherein the State uses the colonial Land Acquisition Act to dispossess people from their homes, lands and livelihoods, and consistently refuses to create just resettlement and rehabilitation entitlements and accountability frameworks to enable restoration of their livelihoods and their dignity. Instead, it promotes cash compensation (often aggressively and violently) to make people give up their homes, villages, land and other natural resources.||S PARASURAMAN,HIMANSHU UPADHYAYA,GOMATHY BALASUBRAMANIAN

On 15 July, the National Environment Appellate Authority quashed the environmental clearance that had been given to the project. The saga of Sompeta is one of many arms of the central and state governments colluding with the promoters to turn fact into fiction and give clearance to a polluting project in a fragile ecological area, disrupting thousands of livelihoods.||E A S SARMA

Locke's concept of wasteland, as opposed to value-producing land, constituted a founding binary opposition that constructed how landscapes were categorised. The period under study covers the Permanent Settlement (1793), the Ryotwari Settlement of Bombay, and the India Forest Acts (1865 and 1878). It is shown as to how the categories of waste and productive land were applied to groups supposedly attached to different landscapes, ie, "tribes" and "castes". Associated with wildness, wilderness, and savagery in the 19th century, the category of wasteland also defined who would and who would not become most vulnerable to dispossession and/or enclosure.||JUDY WHITEHEAD

These pachyderms are liable to cause serious human-elephant conflicts in the new areas they move to. Though the task force's prescriptions to mitigate conflicts pay lip service to involving local communities in conservation, in essence they lean towards displacing the adivasis who have lived in the forests for centuries and now have the legal right to do so.||SAGARI R RAMDAS

But with the potential to radically alter India's economy, and reshape the human security terrain and even the geopolitical order of south Asia, climate change is an issue on which India has perhaps the greatest to lose. Despite the importance of economic growth, "rising India" and inclusive development are not mutually exclusive. Adaptation to inevitable environmental shifts is necessary; political adaptation – including unity amongst the estranged south Asian neighbours – is imperative to manage the political and security-oriented consequences of climate change.||NEIL PADUKONE

A study finds that the distress of the region simply cannot be explained by the absence or irregularity of rainfall. There are long-term structural problems which have had a cumulative effect over the years. Reasons for the present unviability of agriculture should be sought in the historically determined social relations of production, the intimate correlation of caste and landownership in the region as well as the neglect of traditional water management systems and the push towards cultivation of water-intensive commercial crops.||PERSPECTIVES

These funds have largely been spent on "habitat improvement" activities. In the absence of a scientific evaluation of such activities, inappropriate management of landscapes has led to human-wildlife conflicts in certain areas. Moreover, funds are being used for construction of conservation structures, forest roads and planting of exotic tree species without assessing the resulting adverse ecological effects and the gradual degradation in the quality of wildlife habitat.||SANJAY GUBBI

This paper attempts to draw on the critical literature to understand the role and meaning of neoliberalism, particularly in the context of the rural drinking water reforms in Maharashtra. While the influence of neoliberalism cannot be understood as something that determines the course of the reforms in an absolute sense, its varied and often insidious channels of operation imply that its influence cannot be taken lightly either. This, in turn, has implications for the kind of political position that one takes on the reforms as well as for future research directions.||PRIYA SANGAMESWARAN

Increasing water storage is a key adaptation strategy, and the experience of irrigation tanks illustrates both the potential and challenges of this adaptation response. Although there are over 2,08,000 tanks in India, irrigating about 2.3 million hectares in 2000-01, the net area irrigated by tanks declined by 29% between 1990-91 and 2000-01 and by 32% between 2001 and 2008. This paper reviews the challenges faced by tank irrigation and examines options for improving their performance -revenue mobilisation through multiple use of tanks, augmenting groundwater resources in the tanks, integrating social forestry and desilting, and tank modernisation.||K PALANISAMI,RUTH MEINZEN-DICK,MARK GIORDANO

Subsidies are believed to be ubiquitous in public expenditure. Estimates of sectoral/service-level subsidy, however, are based on a notion of unrecovered cost. This paper discusses the estimates of the annualised budgetary cost of and recovery from four public services, namely, drinking water, irrigation, power and road transport in Rajasthan between 1990-91 and 2006-07. An aggregate under-recovery in these (four) public services, as a proportion of gross state domestic product, appears to be ratcheting up gradually. Irrigation and power, constituting more than 80% of aggregate under-recovery, depict wider inequity in spread of benefits from public expenditure. Further, sectors constituting a relatively small proportion of aggregate under-recovery, namely, drinking water and road transport, are biased against the relatively poor. Worse, in the case of road transport, revenue from such taxes far exceeds estimated under-recovery. It also highlights the growing tendency of tax-based financing and lackadaisical approach towards pricing of public services.||MUKESH ANAND

However, with the shift in acreage in favour of certain cash crops which demand relatively less moisture, the requirement of water in agriculture may change. This paper finds, after estimating the total water required for irrigation purposes in Kerala, that the state government need not pump a huge amount of funds into major irrigation projects.||M LATHIKA

By using the stochastic frontier technique, it provides an idealised yardstick to evaluate the performance of the health sector. Carried out in two stages of estimation, the results of our model, using district-level panel data, indicate that the efficiency of the public health delivery system in Karnataka remains low. Considerable disparities across districts in per capita availability as well as utilisation of hospitals, beds and manpower inputs hamper improvements in life expectancy in the state. Results from the second stage of estimation suggest that in rural areas particularly, improvements in infrastructure facilities like safe drinking water supply, toilets and electricity as well as better coordination between social sector and economic policies, especially at the district level, may also help the state improve life expectancy speedily and more equitably in the deficient districts.||BRIJESH C PUROHIT

Instead of being strengthened, the international climate regime was weakened by the now serious threat to close the legally binding and top-down Kyoto Protocol system and to replace it with a voluntary pledge system.||MARTIN KHOR

The insights drawn are situated in an historical recognition of the interface between agricultural crises and agricultural knowledge. The paper offers a window on both ongoing debates in agricultural science and the experiences of other recent international assessments of energy, the environment, and climate change. It is concerned with analysing how the IAASTD was designed and written, for what it can tell us about the conclusions drawn and controversies raised. The democratic practices underpinning the set of IAASTD reports and the integrated approach to agricultural knowledge, science, and technology, commodity production, and environmental and social goals, are central for understanding contemporary debates about agricultural knowledge.||SHELLEY FELDMAN,STEPHEN BIGGS,RAJESWARI RAINA
