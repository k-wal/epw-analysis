This article provides an analysis of the imposition of capitalist property rights over natural resources in India as processes of primary accumulation. These processes are evidenced by the construction of large dams and mines, in addition to the proliferation of free market environmentalism. Moreover, the scope for primary accumulation remains substantial in view of the hydel potential and new circuits of accumulation emerge under the auspices of free market environmentalism. Are the desiderata of ecological sustainability and human development realised under the logic of primary accumulation and a neoliberal commitment to economic growth?||SIRISHA C NAIDU,PANAYIOTIS T MANOLAKOS

Relying on a wide-ranging literature review, this article analyses the alleged impacts of such plantations, the protesters involved, and the modalities of the conflicts. It finds that the prominent cause of resistance is related to corporate control over land resulting in displacement and the end of local uses of ecosystem resources. Resistance includes the "weapons of the weak" and ranges from dialogue to direct confrontation. Authorities have responded by repression in half of the cases reported, while popular struggles have been successful in about one-fifth. These movements can be understood as forms of the "environmentalism of the poor".||JULIEN-FRANÇOIS GERBER

First, the nature of legality cannot be defined in narrow terms of mining laws, but needs to cover the environmental and social goods that lie in its ambit. Second, the massive growth in mining is directly related to the nature of economic liberalisation and loosening of government controls. Present mechanisms of administrative and judicial oversight have proved insufficient to stop this loot.||GOPAL K KADEKODI

The two groups do not talk to each other — they are talking at each other and with every passing day, the gap seems to be widening. But the real conflict is not between conservation and development but between environment and the reckless exploitation of man and earth in the name of efficiency.||JAIRAM RAMESH

The Environmental Impact Assessment report proceeds on two a priori assumptions: that the existing Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport at Santa Cruz/Sahar is incapable of future expansion or development; and that there is no other viable site. In the bargain, it concedes that the site is fraught with environmental and legal issues, but claims these to be insignificant.||DEBI GOENKA,GAUTAM S PATEL

The promise of a rapidly growing automobile market has brought every global auto manufacturer of significance to India. The result has been a pattern of consumption of the means to mobility which discourages discussion of its impacts, just as surely as it subdues debate about alternatives. Moreover, the State is powerfully rearranging the landscape with a hugely expensive programme to build a nationwide expressway network that will encourage individual consumption of mobility at the cost of public alternatives.||RAHUL GOSWAMI

The Politics of Conservation as Translated in Mudumalai||The notification of Mudumalai Sanctuary in Tamil Nadu as a tiger reserve in 2007 has resulted in a contested politics between activists, non-governmental organisations and conservationists with regard to the future of protected area management. This paper presents an account of how these actors positioned themselves around not only the creation of the tiger reserve, but also the proposed elephant corridor and the Forest Rights Act of 2006. It suggests that due process of law has not been followed adequately and that sufficient scientific evidence has not been presented in the public domain as required. The Forest Rights Act is seen to offer an opportunity to democratise the management of natural resources with all its social and ecological complexities and provide the necessary checks and balances to bring about conservation based strongly on scientific evidence.||DANIEL TAGHIOFF,AJIT MENON

However, this order of things seems to be changing where the economy is now, increasingly, being perceived as a subset of the ecology. This is akin to a "New Copernican Revolution" in the way we look at human relations with nature and with each other. Recent instances, like Vedanta's Niyamgiri rejection, indicate that entrenched ideas are changing in India too.||ADITYA NIGAM

This decision is also important since it could set a precedent within environmental regulation with reference to technologies with significant environmental risks. However, the decision also reflects a clear departure from procedure and its legal basis is tenuous and therefore the risk of it being reversed remains. This establishes a clear case for ensuring legal certainty in environmental regulations especially in the case of technologies with significant risks attached to it.||NUPUR CHOWDHURY,NIDHI SRIVASTAVA

Lessons from Tamil Nadu||The central government's policies have inadvertently de-emphasised environmental health and other preventive public health services in India since the 1950s. Diseases resulting from insanitary conditions impose high costs even among the more affluent, and rapid urbanisation increases the potential for disease spread. We analyse the central government's policies and then describe Tamil Nadu's public health system, which offers basic principles for strengthening public health within the administrative and fiscal resources available to most states. We suggest establishing a public health focal point in the health ministry, and revitalising the states' public health managerial and grassroots cadres. There needs to be phased progress in four areas: (1) enactment of public health acts to provide the basic legislative underpinning for public health action; (2) establishment of separate public health directorates with their own budgets and staff; (3) revitalisation of public health cadre; and (4) health department engagement in ensuring municipal public health.||MONICA DAS GUPTA,B R DESIKACHARI,RAJENDRA SHUKLA,T V SOMANATHAN,P PADMANABAN,K K DATTA

A study of six villages in the lower Bhavani Basin in Tamil Nadu reveals that despite a strong willingness on the part of farmers to adopt agricultural best management practices, inadequate infrastructure and the high transaction costs involved in accessing such services make them reluctant to test soil samples regularly. This paper looks at the institutional, infrastructural and agronomic factors influencing farmers' willingness, and concludes that the new policy needs to be supplemented with basic agricultural extension services through public-private partnerships.||SACCHIDANANDA MUKHERJEE

A study of the project shows certain processes of religious revivalism in environmental politics. The power given to place imagination and the effective use of the symbol of Krishna as an environmentalist in this project finds resonances in sectarian Hindu politics. There appears to be an implicit affinity between the two, often creating a common language.||MUKUL SHARMA

However, currently only 30% of the targeted villages receive regular water supplies, less than 20% of the canal network has been constructed and power generation remains well below the generation capacity reached. Even as the dam construction nears completion, rehabilitation of several thousand families is poor or incomplete. This, for a project that has had clearly laid out legal mandates to alleviate human and environmental costs, and has been under continuous public scrutiny and Supreme Court monitoring. The performance of this project does not seem very different from other Indian major irrigation and power projects: while main civil works somehow get completed, infrastructure and efforts necessary to realise benefits of the projects remain incomplete. The experience of people displaced by the Sardar Sarovar Project is fairly consistent with the experiences of millions displaced by other projects across the country, wherein the State uses the colonial Land Acquisition Act to dispossess people from their homes, lands and livelihoods, and consistently refuses to create just resettlement and rehabilitation entitlements and accountability frameworks to enable restoration of their livelihoods and their dignity. Instead, it promotes cash compensation (often aggressively and violently) to make people give up their homes, villages, land and other natural resources.||S PARASURAMAN,HIMANSHU UPADHYAYA,GOMATHY BALASUBRAMANIAN

On 15 July, the National Environment Appellate Authority quashed the environmental clearance that had been given to the project. The saga of Sompeta is one of many arms of the central and state governments colluding with the promoters to turn fact into fiction and give clearance to a polluting project in a fragile ecological area, disrupting thousands of livelihoods.||E A S SARMA

But with the potential to radically alter India's economy, and reshape the human security terrain and even the geopolitical order of south Asia, climate change is an issue on which India has perhaps the greatest to lose. Despite the importance of economic growth, "rising India" and inclusive development are not mutually exclusive. Adaptation to inevitable environmental shifts is necessary; political adaptation – including unity amongst the estranged south Asian neighbours – is imperative to manage the political and security-oriented consequences of climate change.||NEIL PADUKONE

This article evaluates the history of the performance of SFCS in general and shows that they have missed a great opportunity to contribute to the process of building a more inclusive, participatory and environment-friendly fiscal federalism via promoting decentralised governance in the country.

These funds have largely been spent on "habitat improvement" activities. In the absence of a scientific evaluation of such activities, inappropriate management of landscapes has led to human-wildlife conflicts in certain areas.

The insights drawn are situated in an historical recognition of the interface between agricultural crises and agricultural knowledge. The paper offers a window on both ongoing debates in agricultural science and the experiences of other recent international assessments of energy, the environment, and climate change. It is concerned with analysing how the IAASTD was designed and written, for what it can tell us about the conclusions drawn and controversies raised. The democratic practices underpinning the set of IAASTD reports and the integrated approach to agricultural knowledge, science, and technology, commodity production, and environmental and social goals, are central for understanding contemporary debates about agricultural knowledge.||SHELLEY FELDMAN,STEPHEN BIGGS,RAJESWARI RAINA
