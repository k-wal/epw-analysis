27/2/1982- ||review of management, february 1982||4370725||Trends in the Textile Industry and the Dilemma in Indian Cotton Textile Policy||The distinction between the mill and the decentralised - handloom, powerloom and khadi - sectors of the cotton textile industry in India particularly in respect of factor intensity, volume of production, export, and policy, is evident. Both of these sectors of the textile industry, however, have been engaged side by side in production and marketing for more than a century. Since independence, however, some factors hindered the simultaneous and balanced development in these two separate fields of textile production. The growth of the industry as a whole was thus hampered. The present study attempts to analyse certain important factors which have largely hampered the growth of the industry and turned the textile policy of the government ineffective, leading to a dilemma.||Sakti Nath Saha

This paper does not propose a recasting of the existing system. It only proposes a strengthening of its foundations so that it can continue to perform its developmental role and remain a valuable aid to government in its developmental tasks. A very necessary new dimension the Financial System must acquire, namely, building up of a secondary Financial System, outlined in this paper, requires conscious planning and action under the leadership of the Reserve Bank of India. The emphasis should be on creating a viable group of such secondary institutions, and not a haphazard growth or mushrooming of unviable institutions.||S. Kumarasundaram

18/9/1982- ||special articles||4371371||Morphology of Urbanisation in India: Some Results from 1981 Census||The Provisional Population Totals of the 1981 Census reveal a marked acceleration in the pace of urbanisation in India during the decade 1971-81. This paper seeks to place this development in its proper perspective, both in relation to past trends in India as well as in relation to the urbanisation experience of other developing countries. Further understanding of the emerging pattern of urbanisation in sought by the disaggregation of trends upto the state and sub-regional level. It is evident that there has been a marked acceleration in the rate of urban growth in India according to all conventional measurements but that it is still slow as compared with the rest of the world. It is striking that India exhibits a very stable settlement structure such that much of the urban growth that has occurred has been because of the accretion to existing towns and settlements and only marginally because of the emergence of new towns. As a result, the proportion of urban population residing in towns above a certain population cut-off point continues to increase, but there is little evidence of correlation between city size and rates of population growth. Examination of regional and state level data are quite illuminating. The relatively poorer states have urbanised faster than the old industrially advanced states like West Bengal, Tamilnadu and Maharashtra. There are diversities within the large poor states such as UP, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. The sub-regions with heavy industrial investments such as southern Bihar and eastern Madhya Pradesh show very high urban growth rates and correspondingly low rural growth rates. Agriculturally stagnating regions like eastern UP and northern Bihar in the Northern Gangetic Plain also show high rates of urban growth but along with relatively high rural growth rates as well. Agriculturally prosperous regions like Punjab, Haryana and Western UP exhibit marked declines in rural population growth rates along with an acceleration in urban growth. Hence the phenomenon of overall acceleration in urban growth in India has rather diverse causes which have to be understood at the regional level. This paper is published in two parts. The first part, published below, examines the urbanisation record in India since 1901 and the pattern of growth of towns and cities. The second part of the paper, which will appear next week, will analyse the regional pattern of urban growth and also attempt an interpretation of urbanisation in India.||Rakesh Mohan,Chandrashekhar Pant

09/10/1982- ||special articles||4371454||Industrial Growth and Structure: As Seen through Annual Survey of Industries||Based on the summary results of Annual Survey of Industries for 1978-79, this paper reviews the growth of and the structural changes in the factory sector in India during the 1970s. It is brought out that growth in the number of factories decelerated during the 1970s and that a preponderant part of the increase in recent years has taken place in small-size units and in the category of individual proprietorships and partnerships. While the share of the organised sector in fixed capital was broadly sustained, its relative share in employment as well as in emoluments fell conspicuously. In the disposition of valueadded in the factory sector, the share of wages fell while that of profits and interest payments rose sharply. Despite many limitations of the data, it can be asserted a priori that the ASI does not show any tendency for the capital-output ratio to rise. Also, over two-thirds of the productive capital in the ASI sector is borrowed capital. Over the years, the size distribution of factories has become more skewed, particularly when size of capital is considered. Interestingly, small-sized factories in terms of employment possess relatively large fixed and productive capital. The capital-output ratio for the 'unorganised' sectors was 0.90 while it was 1.07 for the private corporate sector. Age-wise the feature of high capital-output ratio is true of factories started during the Second Plan period as well as those started since 1971. Industry-wise, the electricity industry accounted for 44 per cent of fixed capital but less than 9 per cent of employment and 12.7 per cent of valueadded; its capital-output ratio in 1978-79 was as high as 8.25 against the average of 2.40. State-wise, the concentration of factories in the top four industrialised states was still as high as 44.7 per cent. While the relative positions of Maharashtra and West Bengal deteriorated, those of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu improved. Factory employment in West Bengal rose by 3.7 per cent as contrasted with the rise of 24.5 per cent in the country as a whole between 1973-74 and 1978-79. If the top nine states were considered, the concentration of factories can be said to have increased over the years. Also, in almost all the industries, the concentration of output in the respective top three states declined between 1973-74 and 1978-79, but only very slightly. [This article is being published in two parts. The first part, which appeared last week, presented the results of the ASI for 1978-79 with comparable data for earlier years. This, the second, part deals with ownership and organisational patterns of factories, their characteristics by the period of their establishment, their industry-wise classification and the concentration of industry as revealed by the state-wise distribution of factories.]||S.

28/8/1982- ||review of management, august 1982||4371289||Harnessing Technology to Development||There are two problems with regard to technology choice: one that of searching, assimilating, adapting, and improving modern technology and the other of upgrading traditional technology. Policy action at the national, regional and international level has to be directed towards tackling these two problems. In order to reduce the cost of modern technology and adapt it to national resources-structure, skills, machine building capacities and development objectives, it is essential to have adequate information relating to alternative technologies and sources of these technologies, and technological competence to identify problems relating to unpackaging of technology and adaptation of modern technology. The basic stage at which such information and competence would be most fruitful is at the project formulation stage - that is, at the stage of design and engineering of a project, once the project idea is identified. This implies that the LDCs should set up Technical Consultancy Services Centres (TCSCs), which should have the information and the competence to search for appropriate technology and its sources and to identify the adaptation and research problems. It is not possible, however, for each individual LDC to bargain effectively with the foreign suppliers of technology and thus prevent the overpricing of technology in various ways. Some concerted international action is essential. South-South co-operation in this field is possible and would be to the advantage of all LDCs.||V. V. Bhatt

It merely purports to: (a) Identify the concessions made by the developing countries. These concessions, it is argued, assumed a double form: on the one hand, the most significant changes sought by the developed countries were accepted; on the other hand, no concerted attempt was made by the developing countries to push through amendments which sought to rectify the inequities which characterised the Draft Convention. (b) Explore the possibility of the United States, which was one of the four countries that voted against the Convention at the UN Conference, ratifying the treaty by examining briefly its rationale for voting against the treaty. (c) Question further the thesis that developing countries have much to gain from the Convention.||B. S. Chimni

05/6/1982- ||special articles||4370999||The Vanishing MRTP Act: Will Only the Grin Remain?||A series of measures have been announced by the government during the last few weeks purportedly to ensure increase in production and productivity. The two most important aspects of thesee measures are the liberalisation of industrial licensing provisions and the proposed amendments of the MRTP Act. When the MRTP Act was passed and the new industrial licensing policy was adopted in 1970, the idea was that these instruments would be used to bring about structural changes in respect of the existing concentration of economic power. The Joint Sector as defined by the one side, and Section 27 of the MRTP Act under which undue concentrations could be broken up, on the Dutt Committee, on the other, were expected to be used for this purpose. The trend, however, has been not towards such purposeful use of the instruments available, or their further rationalisation. It has been put on an appearance of radicalism while gradually removing the teeth of the regulations so as to help big business while, at the same time, taking care to see that adequate benefit is obtained in the process by those in positions of authority. In this situation, one does not quite see the purpose of maintaining a Monopolies Commission, an MRTP Act or Industrial Licensing. Of course, just as every statement which has retracted from the basic objectives has paid lip service to the Industrial Policy Resolution of 1956, so also perhaps it is necessary to have instruments like the IDR Act, the MRTP Act and other controls for the sake of appearance, and also to do the necessary arm-twisting so as to ensure that various business elements do not forget to whom they owe their prosperity and to whom they should pay proper obeisance, and much else.||H.

The final section discusses in detail how these social and economic changes have given rise to, and are reflected in, various ethnic based solidarity movements as well as socio-cultural movements revolving round the question of tribal religion, language and script, and political movements whose demands range from greater political autonomy to independence and whose methods range from constitutional agitation to armed insurgency.

The public sector in Indian industry has grown as much through the default of the private sector as by the design of government policy-makers. However, its development has not been adequate for (a) attaining a reasonably high rate of growth of manufacturing industry, (b) ensuring a high rate of expansion of manufacturing employment and thereby initiating a change in the occupational structure, (c) reducing the degree of inequality in the development of large-scale industry as between the few advanced enclaves and the vast territory which continues to be empty of any large-scale plants, (d) acting as a force for reducing income disparities among the people, and (e) rendering India technologically more self-reliant.||Amiya Kumar Bagchi

The approach needs, basically, an urge to look at the poor as a social stratum distinguishable from other strata and to look into the process giving rise to stratification of society. There is little evidence of this approach in the Indian researches on measurement of poverty. Could it be that in their anxiety to obtain estimates of poverty these researches tend to lose sight of the poor and of the system of which the poor are a part?||V. M. Rao,M. Vivekananda

In seeking to resolve this situation, one area which has been so far relatively neglected, but which will determine the eventual release and development of world productive forces and markets, is the transfer of technology and the strangehold of patents. Of the 3.5 mn patents today, only one per cent are with the developing countries. Until this particular property relation and imbalance between the developed and developing countries is changed, other measures for transfer of resources will be superficial and ineffective. This article outlines the background and the efforts under way by UNCTAD to resolve this knotted international economic problem in which the destinies of even the developed countries are involved.||Surendra J.

1/4/1982- ||constraints on growth||4370834||Industrial Growth: Another Look||While India's performance in the industrial sector since independence is certainly impressive, there are some disturbing features and trends in the rate of growth of industrial production which call for serious attention. Most striking among these is the deceleration of the industrial growth rate and the sizeable underutilisation of capacities. The problem with many of the explanations offered for these developments is that the proponents of each theory tend to believe that there is just one explanation that will account for the entire sequence of events over the thirty-year period, when in fact different factors have been predominant in different parts of this period. While in the early years of Plan formulation the biggest constraint in the way of growth was seen to be the low savings ratio, over the years the country has been able to raise the savings and investment ratios to very impressive levels. However, the rise in incremental capital-output ratio has nullified the output increase that would otherwise have come from the increase in the share of investment to income. A systematic analysis of the factors that have contributed to the rise in the incremental capital-output ratio is, therefore, called for.||C. Rangarajan
20/3/1982- ||special articles||4370791||The Budget and the Economy||The features of the Budget for 1982-83 which are worth noting are the following: (1) The attempt to bring in some progression within the regime of indirect taxation by exempting articles of 'mass consumption' and, on the other hand, by sharply increasing the rates on articles 'favoured by affluent sections'. (2) The social security certificate and the capital investment bond. (3) Efforts to increase production in the 'year of productivity' by exempting 38 tariff items from excise duty. (4) Dual pricing in cement. If none of these - not to speak of other measures meant to encourage savings - strikes one as particularly 'bold', it is no accident. For the occasion does not call for any boldness. What is required is quiet performance and, on the whole, it has been done well. Any major reservations about commitments made on the expenditure side are also unwarranted. Defence spending, of course, will go up. A serious attempt will also be made to increase the Plan outlay for 1982-83 with the two-fold emphasis on the infrastructural 'core' and poor relief, both of which are basic requirements of the system. Is it, then, a 'neutral' budget? Certainly not. It is on the whole, and inevitably, in favour of those who do not have to count the cost, for they are the ones (apart from the weather) who are now responsible for the performance of the system.||C.

Even before the no less dramatic strike in 1929, the communist leaders had consolidated their position, and fought at the helm of a one lakh strong organisation. The colonial state responded to the strike with vindictive measures, one of which was the Meerut Conspiracy Case. While the national bourgeoisie sought the help of and actively collaborated with the colonial government, the position of the Indian National Congress, dominated by interests which were anxious for the strike to be defeated, was more ambiguous since it could not openly support the assumption of more repressive powers by the colonial government on the eve of its own civil disobedience movement. The Congress therefore found a way out by splitting the working class by the setting up of a rival organisation. By the time the strike came to an end, these right-wing elements were on the way to establish their control over the working class.||Georges Kristoffel Lieten

Since the 1960s important changes have taken place in role of the Congress and elite composition. Their overall impact is that federal-state relations can no longer be viewed as a bargaining process. This paper attempts to provide an analysis of India's federal politics from the perspective of the transformed role of the Congress and the new elite structures.||Amal Ray

The required calculations for profitability are made on the assumption of expected level of operations of the project, generally, called 'normal capacity utilisation'. But entrepreneurs are seldom sure that normal capacity will be utilised in actual operations. Internal organisational and environmental uncertainties force entrepreneurs to ask: What if the project does not run at the assumed capacity level? Will the project be in a position to at least recover its costs? These risk-induced questions motivate the calculation of BEP. This paper emphasises that BEP is essentially a risk-measure. Once it is appreciated that BEP is a risk-measure, it is pertinent to examine its relationship with other risk-measures often in use in investment decision making. This paper examines this relationship and puts BEP in the proper perspective in the risk-theory. In the process, the contributions in the area of 'break-even analysis under uncertainty' are critically reviewed.||Satya Prakash Singh,Jayant V. Deshpande

However, the concept of industrial man is not restricted to behavioural analysis alone. It is organically linked with several aspects of the whole process of industrialisation. The working conditions and social relations in India's informal sector in general, and in small industries in particular, urge us either to seek a new definition of 'industrial man' or to dispense with the concept altogether.||Chandan Sengupta

Yet politics in Punjab is articulated more along religious than along class lines. The root cause of the communal tension in Punjab lies in the channelling of economic growth through the existing inegalitarian social structure. Economic development, instead of rectifying an unjust social structure is reinforcing it. The leading positions in the competing sectors of the economy are occupied by castes belonging to the two different religious categories. Since these castes also occupy leading positions in their respective religious categories, they are able to invoke the solidarity of their religious group in safeguarding their economic interests from the encroachment of the dominant castes of the opposite religious group. In this competition between the haves belonging to the different religious groups, the have-nots in each religious group are made pawns. Communal politics in the Punjab has thus blunted the edge of class struggle.||Victor S. D'Souza

On the basis of a survey of the operations of MNCs in India, the study observes that a large number of companies in the country are interconnected through non-resident undertakings. However, most of the companies interconnected this way avoided registration under the MRTP Act. Therefore, in the absence of even identification, regulation of multinational monopolies becomes a formidable task. Section I briefly gives the background of the development of the MNC's hold in the various industrial sub-sectors. Section II outlines the need for control of the foreign controlled enterprises (FCEs). Section III sketches some problems in identification of foreign control and hence in their regulation. Section IV lists the corporate regulatory legislation in India. Section V examines the efficacy of the legislation in regulating multinational monopolies. And Section VI draws some conclusions.||Nagesh Kumar

Fortunately, the budgets of the Central and state governments presents information on the financial progress of the Plan in the current year and the estimated expenditure on the Plan in the next year. Only a few states have so far submitted their budgets for 1982-83, but the Central Budget gives some broad information regarding the size and break-up of State Plans as a whole by heads of development. In view of the great public interest in knowing how far the Plan is being implemented and the changes in the quantum and pattern of Plan allocations, presentation of the Central Budget affords a first opportunity to discuss this question on the basis of some reliable data.||D.

More often than not the limit has moved up more than was necessary to neutralise the inflationary impact. The burden on the lowest and the highest levels has also been neutralised. It is the middle ranges which have suffered a higher tax incidence because of inflation. However, to regard this as an undesirable development is to assume that the pattern of graduation prevailing earlier was optimal, whereas it can be argued that the incidence of 12.3 per cent on an income of Rs 30,000 at 1970-71 prices (Rs 72,200 at 1981-82 prices) was too low to begin with. Direct taxes have already lost their weight in our scheme of taxation and it would not be desirable to reduce the area of income taxation further. Rather than demolish it altogether, as some would like to, the attempt should be to extend the coverage of income taxation - and inflation in a way helps in that - and to see how its yield can be improved. The considerations on which the Fifth Plan had suggested a major thrust towards raising the yield of direct taxes are still valid; they should not be lost sight of simply because indirect taxes are easier to collect.||Amaresh Bagchi

Consequently, changes in the institutional framework of agriculture - i e, in the ownership, control, and use of land - have a major impact on a land-based social order. The Kerala Land Reforms (Amendment) Act, 1969, has drastically altered the traditional land system of Kerala. This paper is concerned with the implementation of the Act in a selected typical village. The paper is divided into three sections. Section I will describe the village land system as it existed prior to 1970, the year in which the implementation of the Act was begun; section II will analyse the implementation of the Act and the resultant land transfers in the village; and section III will bring out the consequent changes in the village land system.||P.

27/11/1982- ||special article||4371602||Incentives and Their Impact: Some Studies on Small Industry||Government of India, state governments, and the agencies sponsored by them, have had a number of special aid programmes for the small industry sector for long. However, before going ahead with the new programmes or with the strengthening of the existing programmes of assistance, they have to be extremely careful. Small industry is an easy-entry sector, and the assistance programmes should not make entry too easy. Overcrowding in this sector may nullify the impact of assistance, or, what is worse, make assistance counter-productive. This paper has three sub-themes, all of which are subsumed under the question of efficacy and incentives for small industry. The first sub-theme relates to long-term financial assistance, the second to reservation, and the third to the use and significance of incentives. Section I describes the genesis and scope of this study, Sections II, III and IV present the findings on the hypotheses. Section V summarises the opinions on different types of incentives. Section VI presents the rationale of the framework of explanations of the statistical results. The explanations follow in Sections VII, VIII and IX. Section X comprises concluding remarks on the subject and the policy implications.||J. C. Sandesara

A deeper understanding of these issues is very essential in view of India's expanding trade with the Soviet Union.||R. G. Gidadhubli

30/10/1982- ||special articles||4371528||Western Marxism and Literary Modernism||Soon after the Bolshevik Revolution, there began a confrontation between Marxist precepts on literature and art and the experimental practices of the avant-garde in Soviet Russia. Ever since then, the nature and function of literary modernism has been a major preoccupation of Marxist discourse on literature and has, to a considerable extent, shaped the contours of recent advances in Marxist literary theory itself. This paper offers an exposition and an assessment of the major Marxist approaches to literary modernism as well as the historical factors which have shaped these approaches. It begins with a survey of the Lukacs-Brecht debate of the 1930s and goes on to discuss some of the issues raised by Walter Benjamin and Theodor Adorno as well as some more recent contributions towards a Marxist theory of literary modernism. A brief conclusion argues that these theoretical disputes are in fact linked with some crucial, if untheorised and unresolved, issues in Marxist discourse on ideological production in general and literary production in particular.||Prabhakara Jha

04/12/1982- ||special article||4371627||Semi-Feudalism or Capitalism? Contemporary Debate on Classes and Modes of Production in India||For over a dozen years Indian and foreign marxists have been arguing with passion, subtlety and an abundance of statistics about the existing mode of production in Indian agriculture or, more broadly, in India. There have been proponents of capitalism, pre-capitalism, semi-feudalism, colonial and post-colonial modes, and recently, a dual mode. From the beginning, the debate has been carried on simultaneously at several levels: that of the individual cultivating unit, that of the agricultural sector of a particular region (e g, Punjab-Haryana or Eastern India) or of India as a whole, that of the entire economy of a region or of India as a whole; that of the colony-metropole relationship or of the imbrication of India in the world economy. A number of authors have brought in freshly gathered field data at the first and second levels to buttress their arguments. Others have drawn upon the vast stock of data available from official sources such as the Farm Management Studies, the National Sample Survey, the Rural Credit Surveys, the Censuses and Agricultural Censuses and the Rural Labour Surveys. Some authors have used historical sources to document their analyses of nineteenth century developments. Several of the economista have employed mathematical models. A handful have restricted themselves to purely theoretical exercises. This paper seeks to delineate the main issues at stake in the debate, embracing modes, forces and relations of production; modes of exploitation; agrarian classes; social formations, contradictions and articulations; movements and dominant tendencies; effects of imperialism and of centre-periphery links; and recommendations for praxis. This is the first part of the paper which is being published in three parts.||Alice Thorner

31/7/1982- ||review of political economy, july 1982||4371180||Class Struggle and Structural Changes: Coir Mat and Matting Industry in Kerala, 1950-80||This paper attempts to describe and explain the structural changes that have occurred in the coir mat and matting industry of Kerala since the end of the nineteen forties. The coir weaving industry - once the premier manufactory industry of Travancore localised in and around the town of Alleppey - is today dispersed in small-scale cottage units distributed all over the rural areas. This article traces this path traversed by the coir industry, from a structure dominated by large-scale manufactories to one characterised by the predominance of small-scale domestic production units. The bigger capitalists progressively withdrew from the sphere of production, but continued to dominate the production process by their control over the markets. Capitalist development is usually equated with progress from domestic production units to large-scale manufactories and thence to mechanised factories. The decentralisation of production in the coir industry therefore forms an interesting case study in the context of this point of view. It shows that the evolution of the organisation of capitalist production need not be unilinear. Much depends upon the specificities of class struggle. Decentralisation of production has to be seen as a strategy of capital to by-pass the social limits imposed by an organised working-class to capitalist exploitation in the large-scale manufactories.||T.

Arguing that neither a purely formalist approach (in terms of written laws and constitutions) nor a structuralist approach (based on the proclaimed ideologies) can serve as reliable guides to probe the direction and functioning of the political systems currently prevailing in Africa, the paper considers three alternative approaches: the personal-psychological, the anthropological and the Marxist or neo- Marxist. It finds that a class analysis of African political process helps one to cross the barriers earlier raised by the development school. As most African economies function as subordinate units in the network of international finance and market systems, the dynamics of inter-relationship between the material base and the political superstructure can only be analysed in the context of the impact of external forces on Africa's internal developments.||Anirudha Gupta

04/9/1982- ||special articles||4371322||The Nilgiris as a Region||It is useful to sort out two meanings of the term region. One refers to a human region as defined by outside observers, based on their perceptions and taxonomy, using general 'etic' criteria to specify its nature and extent. The other is the region as perceived by participants in it, as understood in the insiders 'emic' perceptions as engaging their sense of identity and attracting their loyalties. A person normally identifies with several regions, of narrower or wider scope; one's loyalties are made manifest to a closer region in a particular situation, to a broader one in a different context. Each of these two types of regions takes in a different kind of reality, but not totally separate realities. People who share the same terrain and climate, who cope with like environmental conditions, who have similar cultural proclivities, have some common ground for developing a degree of common identity. That degree is enhanced if they see themselves as together confronting a mutual threat, whether of nature or of another set of people. True, spatial propinquity has often enough bred hostility and cultural proximity is no bar to enmity. Yet, on balance, both conditions generally favour the development of social and cultural bonds. The peoples and the terrain of the Nilgiri plateau have long attracted interest because of their unusual characteristics. Throughout three principal periods - aboriginal, colonial, national independence - the Nilgiri region has constituted a singular and singularly instructive enclave, a distinctive locale as perceived by observers as well as by its inhabitants.||David G.

The paper is in four sections. Section I presents an ideological perspective of the changes that are taking place, and Sections II and III discuss the economic transformation of tribal society and its impact on the social stratification among the tribals. The final section discusses in detail how these social and economic changes have given rise to, and are reflected in, various ethnic based solidarity movements as well as sociocultural movements revolving round the question of tribal religion, language and script, and political movements whose demands range from greater political autonomy to independence and whose methods range from constitutional agitation to armed insurgency. This is the first part of the paper which is being published in two instalments.||K. S. Singh

The few useful accounts that are available are by the participants themselves none of whom had the opportunity of consulting the official records. This paper argues that the decisions and actions of leaders, British or Indian, cannot really be understood without the counterpoint provided by pressures from below whose more dramatic manifestations were some of these popular movements. It was the fear of popular 'excesses' that made Congress leaders cling to the path of negotiation and compromise and eventually accept partition as a necessary price for the transfer of power. Indeed, the limits of popular anti-imperialist movements (like the Congress) made the truncated settlement unavoidable.||Sumit Sarkar

27/2/1982- ||special articles||4370729||Industrial Stagnation in Eastern India: A Statistical Investigation||This paper tries to establish the empirical basis of the industrial 'stangation' in esatern India in general and West Bengal in particular. The analysis is carried out in terms of symptoms, such as a declining or decelerating rate of industrial growth, or an actual decline in output, or a decline in the share of output. Two important structural phenomena, namely(i) change in the relative growth of the large-scale and the medium-scale manufacturing sector, and (ii) change in the product-composition, are seen to have important causal relationships with the industrial stagnation in eastern India. On the other hand, labour disputes as the principal explanatory variable of stagnation fails to satisfy questions related to industrial stagnation and growth. However, further study will be needed to decide whether the problem is merely structural and regional or whether it is more directly linked to the lack of investment on an all-India scale. This paper has been published in two parts. Sections I-VII appeared last week.||Debdas Banerjee

The comparison leads to the following conclusions: (a) In urban areas, there is no need to canvass the 'usual status' in a labour force survey. (b) It is preferable to delete items like 'work in own right' and 'work as helper' as these items are difficult to adopt in one-point-of-time surveys like the NSS. (c) In future labour force surveys, the NSS 27th round format of questioning regarding the current-status is preferable to the NSS 32nd round variant, which is unconsciously biased towards principal criterion (for the current status). (d) In the 'usual status' it would make more sense and it would be more useful if the two broad categories, 'workers' and 'non-workers', are canvassed in preference to the three-fold classification of 'worker' 'unemployed', and 'outside the labour force'. (e) A pilot survey needs to be conducted to evolve a way for eliciting information on work-time disposition in the current-status approach.||K. N. Shrinivasan

The period considered is 1950 to 1970. Section I outlines theories on the growth patterns of commodity and labour markets. Section II describes trends in demographic pressure, growth, and distribution of growth in India. Section III reviews the growth of commodity markets in India and section IV that of the labour market. While sections III and IV are concerned with all-India trends, Section V deals with one specific area as an instance: viz, Ahmednagar. In the concluding section, the main issues raised in this paper are brought together. The purpose of this paper is to set forth certain hypotheses for further examination.||Ashoka Mody

05/6/1982- ||special articles||4370998||Character of an Urban Economy: 'Small-Scale' Production and Labour Markets in Coimbatore||Based on field research in Coimbatore in 1980, this paper discusses several theories concerning the character and role of 'small-scale' production in relation to the industrial economy as a whole. A distinction is made between small capitalist units of production and 'petty commodity producer' units. The patterns of ownership and financing of both types of units are considered, and the character of the linkages between different forms of production is examined in some detail. The extent of sub-contracting between big capital industries and small units is shown to be considerable, and the interests of big industry in the splitting up of production processes in order to tighten the control of labour are demonstrated. The backgrounds and social characteristics of workers in different levels of industry, in casual work and in self-employment are also analysed; and the degree of segmentation existing within the labour market is shown to be high. Conclusions are drawn on the processes of reproduction of different forms of small-scale production; and it is argued that while they are subordinated in various ways to big capital production their persistence is ensured by the interests of big capital itself, and by the structure of markets, in particular. The paper is published in two parts. This, the first part deals with patterns of ownership and financing, linkages between different forms of production, sub-contracting and splitting up of production processes. The second part, to appear next week, will deal with the backgrounds and social characteristics of workers and the degree of segmentation in the labour market and will also present the author's conclusions.||John Harriss
31/7/1982- ||special articles||4371190||Real Wages of Agricultural Labour in Andhra Pradesh: Two Decades of Stagnation||This paper addresses itself mainly to two issues with reference to Andhra Pradesh: (1) the direction of trends in real wages between 1985-59 and 1978-79; and (2) the association between trends in real wages and trends in net capita (rural) agricultural production. Despite considerable rise in money wages, real wages of agricultural labour in Andhra Pradesh are marked by stagnation. There is no association between trends in real wages and per capita (rural) agricultural production. The picture of stagnation at the state level applies also to almost all the districts. A noteworthy aspect of the data presented here is the negative, though not statistically significant, trend in real wages for a relatively well developed district such as West Godavari which is known to have experienced significant changes in technology.||G.

According to some critics, the political background of the novel is deceptive and the novel is really concerned with metaphysical ideas. Others emphasise the political nature of the incidents and their repercussions; in this view, the novel is really about the struggle between British liberalism and Britain's imperial role in India. This paper suggests that both these approaches are incorrect and inadequate. Underneath the glow of imperial and native rhetoric, the author argues, Forster never disavowed colonialism. The novel represents the crisis of the liberal faith in which India is the echoing background and against which the liberal conscience reveals its hollowness. A postscript briefly takes up for review some of the points made in the article which was originally written about six years ago.||Hiren Gohain

The major objective of the present study is to examine the extent to which economic factors account for inter-country differences in the tax ratios. The factors taken into account are: real GDP, the size of overseas trade measured by the share of exports plus imports in national income, and the demographic pressure measured by the density of population. The paper begins with a brief assessment, in Section I, of major studies available on the subject, in order to identify the relative significance of the factors analysed. This would also form the background for assessing the usefulness of the results of the present exercise. Section II describes the main hypotheses to be tested statistically. Section III presents a model and discusses the rationale for the selection of the variables. Section IV gives a brief account of the sources of data and their limitations, the sample size and the approach of analysis as employed in this study. Statistical results of cross-section data for the period 1972-76 are presented in Section V. The last Section, VI, summarises the main conclusions.||M. M. Ansari

However, while sex and urban-rural differentials present interesting patterns, most striking of all is the high rate of infant mortality during 0-4 years of age. Nearly 47 per cent of total deaths are attributable to deaths in this age group. This article looks into, among other things, the likely causes of this high rate of infant mortality, and the associated policy prescriptions.||P. Padmanabha

20/3/1982- ||special articles||4370793||Policy of 'Inflationary Contraction'||There is enough internal evidence in the 1982-83 Budget to indicate that apart from the price increases already decreed, further increases are contemplated and in fact the budget figures are worked out on that basis. However, despite all these price increases, the Plan outlay in 1982-83 will be far from impressive. Not only is the overall Plan outlay unimpressive, but the outlay on non-energy sectors is particularly so. Obviously not much of the Sixth Plan remains intact. The series of price hikes that have taken place affecting the working people and the middle income groups would have almost certainly produced a relative contraction of aggregate demand. When in addition are considered the tight credit squeeze as well as the fact that additional government investment has been going largely to a few sectors like energy with multiplier effects vastly different from those of the income taxed away, even an absolute contraction of demand in several sectors of the economy should come as no surprise. Indeed, recent economic measures, which, in keeping with the IMF's predilections, have aimed at tight credit and a control of the budget deficit through price and indirect tax hikes, amount to a policy of 'inflationary contraction'.||Prabhat Patnaik

25/12/1982- ||review of agriculture, december 1982||4371699||Pulses Production in Semi-Arid Regions of India: Constraints and Opportunities||Pulse production in India is characterised by diversity of crops and their regional specificity based on adaptation to prevailing agroclimatic conditions. Pulses as a group can utilise limited soil moisture and nutrients more efficiently than cereal crops and for that reason farmers have chosen them to grow under highly adverse conditions. The process of differential resource allocation to pulse crops operates at agro-ecological niche allocation and at individual farmers level, out of necessity, and not out of choice or preference. At present more than 92 per cent of the area under pulses is confined to unirrigated areas, and in future the bulk of pulse production will continue to come from unirrigated areas. Therefore, any plan for increasing pulse production in the country should be based on a long-term approach for improved productivity of these crops under rainfed farming conditions rather than on the use of high inputs. Crop productivity comparisons made under unirrigated conditions between pulses and cereals do not support the general belief that pulses suffer from inherent low productivity. Rather the low productivity of pulses is due to the low input conditions associated with the complex socio-economic and agroclimatic problems of rainfed agriculture. Long neglect of rainfed areas has resulted in poor institutional development and, therefore, there is considerable lag in developing strong traditions of scientific thinking and research, and training of scientists to work in these areas. This para deals in detail with agroclimatic, socio-economic and biological constraints of pulse production and gaps in transfer of technology in rainfed areas.||D. Sharma,N. S. Jodha

It argues that though this regional consciousness articulated was in terms of 'nation', it was not counterposed to Indian nationalism. On the contrary, regional consciousness during the later 19th century emerged contemperaneously with national consciousness; and barring occasional confrontations regional consciousness and national consciousness were not seen as incompatible. While the three regional conciousnesses discussed were described by their proponents as 'nationalism', their later relations with 'Indian nationalism' and its political embodiment, the Indian State, have been marked by carying degrees of recalcitrance and harmony - though increasingly, in recent times, there has been more of recalcitrance and less of harmony in this relationship. This development has been basically the result of certain economic and political forces and not due to any intrinsic logic of a regional consciousness.||Sudhir Chandra

Even after relinquishing office, the impact of some of his policies and, more important, of his quite unique personaliy was perceptible. Yet there is warrant to examine whether the alliances which Urs forged were as strong and enduring as they appeared. There is also room to investigate the extent to which his policies carried within them the built-in limitations of populist politics. This paper attempts a critical evaluation of contribution of Devaraj Urs to Karnataka against the background of his personality and of the state's distinctive social and political features. It also attempts to analyse Urs within the larger perspective of 'regional' politics in India.||Lalitha Nataraj,V. K. Nataraj

It is recognised that the picture being drawn is extremely sketchy; one which does not take into account the finer differences which exist between individual social sciences. Moreover, many of the studies referred to here have been made in the context of different environments. To what extent they apply to the Indian situation needs to be examined.||Harsha Parekh

Certain analytical devices are first formulated to make clear distinctions among the components of irrigation systems and these are then applied to a concrete case. The authors have selected Kanyakumari district for their case study, mainly because scarcity of water and consequent crop failures have been frequent in the tail-end areas of this district in recent years. The last section of the paper briefly outlines some issues thrown up by the study which call for further research.||D. Narayana,V. C. V. Ratnam,K. Narayanan Nair

The authors analyse the production structure and income levels of various farm-size categories. An attempt is also made to examine the emerging pattern of consumption with increase in income brought about by technological change in agriculture. While the analysis covers all categories of cultivators in general, the focus of the study is on bringing out the relative position of marginal and small farmers in the production, income and consumption nexus. The paper is divided into five sections. Section II deals with the production structure of the various categories of cultivators and examines the relationship between farm size and productivity. The levels of farm and non-farm income accruing to each of the farm-size groups and the extent of inequalities in the distribution of income are worked out in Section III. Section IV deals with household consumption and per capita commodity expenditures and provides an idea about the extent of poverty among the cultivating households. Finally, the main conclusions and policy implications emerging from the study are given in Section V. This paper has been published in two parts. The first three sections appeared last week.||G. S.

26/6/1982- ||special articles||4371072||Politicisation of Religion: Conversions to Islam in Tamil Nadu||Tamil Nadu was the centre of an important sociological debate following the conversion of an entire Harijan village to Islam in February 1981. Subsequently there were conversions in several other villages of the state. This invoked reactions from all sections of society and from June till October 1981 the mass media, political parties, religious organisations and, not the least, the state and Central governments devoted considerable attention to these conversions. This paper, being published in two instalments, attempts to trace the history of religious conversions in India in brief and then to look analytically at the Tamil Nadu conversions. Section I presented a brief historical background to the phenomenon of conversion in India, specifically to Islam and Christianity, in medieval times and in the period prior to independence. Section II presented an account of the Meenakshipuram conversions and attempted to situate the event against the background of socio-economic characteristics of Hinduism specific to the region where the conversions took place. Section III (which, along with the later part of Section II is being published this week) attempts to analyse the larger reaction to the event and considers some of the problems arising out of 'secularism in practice'; that is, the problems facing an avowedly secular state like India that is predominantly Hindu in its attitude towards religious minorities and, more specifically, to proseletysing activities.||George Mathew

It also discusses ideological training, reforming people's attitudes and moral incentives. It then outlines how some elements of economic theory can be applied to the Chinese historical experience.||Dipavali Debroy

27/11/1982- ||review of management, november 1982||4371598||India and the International Market in Handknotted Carpets||Carpet weaving is a major cottage industry in India, employing thousands of village artisans. Almost all the Indian production of handknotted carpets, worth more than Rs 100 crore, is exported. The impact of the industry on the Indian economy can thus be seen at two levels. The industry makes a substantial contribution to the balance of payments. Moreover, the 50-60 per cent labour content in carpet production contributes to employment and exerts a pressure on wages in economically backward regions of the country. Though the industry has grown extremely fast over the past two decades, in recent years it has shown a tendency to slow down even as one of its major competitors, such as Iran, has progressively withdrawn from the market. Recently, the Indian industry has been outcompeted by China and, to some extent, by Pakistan. This paper examines recent trends in the international market, and India's performance relative to that of other major suppliers such as Iran, Pakistan, and China. A detailed analysis, of the trade and factors governing it, leads to important implications for policy measures for maximising the industry's contribution to employment and the balance of trade.||Sanjay Sinha
25/12/1982- ||review of agriculture, december 1982||4371698||Agricultural Growth, Instability in Productivity and Rainfall: Case of Karnataka||It is the contention of this paper that instability in productivity or yields per hectare cannot be attributed exclusively to natural or climatic factors. Taking the case of Karnataka, time series data for 1955-56 to 1975-76 for fairly homogeneous districts are pooled for observation. An analysis is made of instability in productivity in relation to rainfall across districts classified with respect to different crop groups. Karnataka was chosen because, within a small distance, it presents a wide variation in levels of rainfall. It becomes clear that concentrated growth efforts in areas with assured rainfall or irrigation can avert increased instability. However, such areas are limited. Indeed, no growth in agriculture could have taken place without farmers taking risks. But rising prices do not compensate farmers for crop failures. Besides, the major problem of the farm ector is not unfavourable prices as insecurity in production and prices. What is needed is a scheme that spreads out the cost of instability in agriculture on a wider basis, covering relatively stable areas and crops as well as the urban industrial and commercial sector.||M.

By doing so, the authors propose to: (a) Fill in a substantial gap in the data base on women's economic activities, and document the contribution of women to the production of rice at different stages. (b) Generate data which could be of use both to women workers themselves (to become aware of their contribution and situation), and to policy-makers in making decisions regarding women's work, wages, health care and other welfare measures). (c) Raise the question whether the concepts and definitions evolved from studying male labourers would remain valid when the problems of women labourers are to be studied specifically.||Joan P.

So far there have been two approaches to this problem - the approach of the equilibrium economists through the price mechanism and that of the evolutionists through a technology policy. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss these two approaches and suggest that though 'right' incentives - prices - are essential, they would not result in effective and efficient choices without a sound tchnology policy. The social cost-benefit analysis of projects and the limitations of this approach are analysed in Section I, while the rationale for a technology policy is indicated in Section II.||V. V. Bhatt

02/10/1982- ||special articles||4371428||Industrial Growth and Structure: As Seen through Annual Survey of Industries||Based on the summary results of Annual Survey of Industries for 1978-79, this paper reviews the growth of and the structural changes in the factory sector in India during the 1970s. It is brought out that growth in the number of factories decelerated during the 1970s and that a preponderant part of the increase in recent years has taken place in small-size units and in the category of individual proprietorships and partnerships. While the share of the organised sector in fixed capital was broadly sustained, its relative share in employment as well as in emoluments fell conspicuously. In the disposition of value added in the factory sector, the share of wages fell while that of profits and interest payments rose sharply. Despite many limitations of the data, it can be asserted a priori that the ASI does not show any tendency for the capital-output ratio to rise. Also, over two-thirds of the productive capital in the ASI sector is borrowed capital. Over the years, the size distribution of factories has become more skewed, particularly when size of capital is considered. Interestingly, small-sized factories in terms of employment possess relatively large fixed and productive capital. The capital-output ratio for the 'unorganised' sectors was 0.90 while it was 1.07 for the private corporate sector. Age-wise the feature of high capital-output ratio is true of factories started during the Second Plan period as well as those started since 1971. Industry-wise, the electricity industry accounted for 44 per cent of fixed capital but less than 9 per cent of employment and 12.7 per cent of valueadded; its capital-output ratio in 1978-79 was as high as 8.25 against the average of 2.40. State-wise, the concentration of factories in the top four industrialised states was still as high as 44.7 per cent. While the relative positions of Maharashtra and West Bengal deteriorated, those of Gujarat and Tamil Nadu improved. Factory employment in West Bengal rose by 3.7 per cent as contrasted with the rise of 24.5 per cent in the country as a whole between 1973-74 and 1978-79. If the top nine states were considered, the concentration of factories can be said to have increased over the years. Also, in almost all the industries, the concentration of output in the respective top three states declined between 1973-74 and 1978-79, but only very slightly. [This article is being published in two parts. This, the first part, presents the results of the ASI for 1978-79 with comparable data for earlier years. The second part will deal with ownership and organisational patterns of factories, their characteristics by the period of their establishment, their industry-wise classification and the concentration of industry as revealed by the state-wise distribution of factories.]||S.

These is a wide and diverging gap between the targetted and actual levels of fertiliser use. The decelaration is mainly due to slackening of demand. This paper attempts to explain the observed trend using farm level data for selected districts. The diffusion process seems to be very weak. The rate and extension of fertiliser use show a secular decline in some districts. Yield rates, particularly for wheat, seem to be declining in some districts although a corresponding decrease in rate of fertiliser application is not noticed. The influence of weather on yields seems to be significant. The fertiliser responses under conditions of mass application seem to be lower than those achieved in SFTs. Non-availability of credit seems to restrict use of fertilisers.||R. Nagaraj

Secondly, deposit growth in recent years has been propelled mainly by fixed deposits in metropolitan areas and savings deposits in rural areas and that, in qualitative if not quantitative terms, the latter is more significant - in the spread of the banking habit and the promotion of savings in financial assets through the medium of bank deposits. It is mainly in the metropolitan areas that banks face serious competition as savers in this area, both individual and institutional, are sophisticated and knowledgeable about alternative avenues for investment, which fact introduces an element of volatility in the growth of deposits in these centres.||Meenakshi Tyagarajan

This paper attempts a materialistic explanation for, and refutation of, this essentially antimaterialist approach towards literature that was developing in England in early 19th century. It critically examines two generally offered explanations for the development of such ideas: one, that they are the inverted reflections of the introduction of the capitalist mode of production in the sphere of literature; and two, that they are a direct reaction against the hard-faced utilitarianism of the new industrial bourgeoisie. The facile determinism of the first explanation evades the internal logic of cultural change; and the second explanation assumes an over-simple antithesis between literature and utilitarianism. Instead, the author argues, the concept of authorial autonomy, no less than that of utilitarian logic, developed in response to the ideological needs of the dominant class in English society in a particular phase; and its apparent total opposition to utilitarianism can be explained by the contradictions between overall development of capitalism and the relative underdevelopment of the capitalist mode of production in one particular sphere - that of literature itself.||Malini Bhattacharya

26/6/1982- ||special articles||4371073||Movement towards Workers' Democracy: Solidarity in Poland||The struggle by the working class in Poland, of which there have been three earlier manifestations (1956, 1970-71 and 1976), is located in problems which originate in the specific form in which production is organised. The control exercised by the bureaucracy over production, distribution and consumption puts fetters on rapid economic progress. It is in the context of the background of the battle at the shopfloor and factory level, between the drive to increase production and the workers' resistance to it, that one can situate the emergence of Solidarity;and the imposition of martial law represents the culmination of the experiences gained currently and over the three earlier cycles of struggle. This paper traces the current and earlier struggles and analyses the planning processes, issue of workers' control over production process and power structure of the party. The paper notes that Solidarity has failed to develop, in the course of the struggle, its own alternative institutional organs, have its own alternative institutional organs, have its own national conference of shopfloor representatives and experts to draw up a specific programme for economic reform different from that of the party. While it struggled for the most crucial political reforms, if the workers had been allowed to develop their own economic reforms, they might then imposed voluntary self-discipline and co-operated in austerity measures necessary for economic recovery. But this, the paper suggests, the hardcore faction in the party was bent on preventing. The result is that while the the Party is still unable to openly call for the destruction of Solidarity it may try to weed out left-wing currents in the movement and follow a short-sighted corporatist strategy of splits, co-operation and the like. But the srategy, which may seem successful in the short run, will leave unresolved the problems posed and the crisis is bound to recur in a more intensified form. This is the first part of the paper which is being published in three parts.||Amrita Chhachhi,Ravi Arvind Palat,Paul Kurian

There is, however, nothing very original in our FFW. Similar schemes have been discussed by economists since long. Moreover, FFWs have been implemented in many less developed countries all over the world, and in many of them for a period longer than in India. What requires careful reasoning and difficult economic analysis, however, is the planning of the details of this programme and not its mere conception. What should be its scale? What should be produced by the projects? What component of wages should be paid in kind? If inflationary pressures are generated, how should they be curbed? What are the likely political constraints? Indeed, the success or failure of a FFW depends on how well the planning body answers such questions and how accurately it anticipates the consequences of the programme. This paper briefly surveys the experiences of different countries in running FFWs, and then goes on to discuss some of the questions raised above.||Kaushik Basu

The talks are to be resumed against the background of the decision of the Reagan administration to unilaterally review the Draft Convention on the Law of the Sea which had been agreed upon last year. This paper considers that the unilateral decision of the Reagan administration to review the Draft Convention has come as a blessing in disguise to the developing countries. The Draft Convention, even as it presently stands, legitimises the loot of the seabed through a legal instrument. The developing countries, instead of 'threatening' to sign the Draft Convention even without the participation of the US, should strive to review the existing Draft Convention itself. The analysis of this paper carries forward the arguments made earlier in the pages of this journal by Frederick Clairmonte and John Cavanagh (February 14, 1981 and June 13, 1981). The present paper draws attention to the debate which continues to rage in the US itself between the protagonists and opponents of the treaty; and secondly, it looks more closely at some of the critical provisions of the Draft Convention, in particular those dealing with the setting of production limits and the transfer of technology.||B.

A typical tenant did not take up the new agricultural strategy; cost-sharing as an investment proposition was also missing from the pattern of behaviour of the landlords. A non-legalised sharecropping arrangement that assures a high share of the produce for the landowners, wielding semi-feudal authority over the tenants in a near stagnant agrarian economy, is the typical reality with respect to the observed households. No neat model on the lines of differential risk aversion, or varying bargaining power of individual lessors and lessees, seems to be applicable to such an economy. At the same time, the typical landlord did not enter into usury practices with his tenants who nevertheless needed both production and consumption loans. In fact, no strong interlinkage could be found between tenancy contracts and credit contracts. The credit market was found to be dominated by the non-landlord loan-givers (e g, traders, professional moneylenders, etc). A model on agrarian backwardness should, therefore, be based on some explanatory factors other than the interlinkage between credit conditions and tenurial arrangements.||Ratan Khasnabis,Jyotiprakash Chakravarty

Marx's theory, as gleaned from his works, deals with the characteristics of administration in capitalist society, of revolutionary change, and of administration in the new society. The classical theory arose at the turn of the century during a crisis caused by rising trade unionism in a time of rising prices and immigration of labour. The Great Depression and the war gave rise to the human relations and other clinical theories, the systems approach, and theories of decision-making. The cold war led to the theory of development administration. These later theories, on examination, turn out to constitute a debate with Marx, a battery of methods for dealing with problems so as to maintain organisations, and an ideology for legitimising capitalism and imperialism.||Satya Deva

While different scholars expressed different opinions, none of them thought of adjusting the effect of a cycle on the time-series data for food-grains production in India before analysing the growth pattern. The purpose of this paper is to emphasise the need for cycle elimination from the foodgrains production data before taking a closer look at the growth pattern. The cycle-adjusted time-series show that the foodgrains production indices, from 1949-50 to 1975-76, have three distinct segments, with second segment being a stagnant period. The first and the third segments show the same growth pattern. It also shows that, even if we consider the cycle-adjusted time-series, the growth model remains indeterminate.||Sibaji Chakrabarti

Indeed, it was so complex and complicated that even Marxists (who can legitimately lay claim to deeper insight into socio-historical processes) in India and abroad took nearly a decade to arrive at firm conclusions about India's attainment of political independence. In order to assess the correctness or otherwise of the various positions on the nature of the 1947 settlement and its aftermath, an attempt is made here to undertake an examination of the following questions: (i) the objective situation in the country on the eve of the settlement; (ii) the subjective evaluations of the situation by the political leaderships of the various class forces; and (iii) the features of the settlement.||Ajit Roy

20/2/1982- ||special articles||4370702||Industrial Stagnation in Eastern India: A Statistical Investigation||This paper tries to establish the empirical basis of the industrial 'stagnation' in eastern India in general and West Bengal in particular. The analysis is carried out in terms of symptoms, such as a declining or decelerating rate of industrial growth, or an actual decline in output, or a decline in the share of output. Two important structural phenomena, namely (i) change in the relative growth of the large-scale and the medium-scale manufacturing sector, and (ii) change in the product-composition, are seen to have important causal relationships with the industrial stagnation in eastern India. On the other hand, labour disputes as the principal explanatory variable of stagnation fails to satisfy questions related to industrial stagnation and growth. However, further study will be needed to decide whether the problem is merely structural and regional or whether it is more directly linked to the lack of investment on an all-India scale. This paper is published in two parts. Sections VIII, IX and X, which discuss the situation in some selected industries of Bihar, Orissa and Assam, will appear next week.||Debdas Banerjee

Most of their 1979 imports were from the nearest industrial countries; but urea was exported from Western Europe as far as South and East Asia, and DAP from the USA to South Asia. The third major N fertiliser imported by developing countries, ammonium sulphate, was chiefly produced as a chemical by-product by industrial countries and exported to neighbouring developing countries. Large quantities of urea were bought on tender by central buying agencies of East and South Asian countries from large producers and their cartels; bunching of orders and inelasticity of demand led to fluctuations in prices as well as freights. Most of the DAP was bought by buyers directly from US producers; there was no open market or competitive price formation, but major importing countries also produced some DAP. The price of ammonium sulphate varied so as to find a market for an elastic supply. In the future, ammonia is likely to emerge as a fertiliser intermediate of considerable interest to developing countries.||Ashok V. Desai

11/9/1982- ||special articles||4371346||New Patterns in Health Sector Aid||Criticisms of health aid have largely been derived from African and Latin American experiences. Such criticisms, while useful, cannot be applied wholesale to India without more detailed examination of the patterns of health sector aid which have actually characterised the period since 1947. This article brings together material on the scale and form that this assistance has taken, and demonstrates that its focus has been preventive in emphasis and oriented towards the primary care sector. In some periods it has contributed a substantial share of total public sector health expenditures, while in some spheres, particularly in the control of communicable diseases, it has played a major role. However, the impact of less substantial sums going to prestige medical colleges or to population control programmes should not be ignored; and several of the aid categories, like the PL-480 counterpart funds and US food surpluses, have been of dubious origin. However, the 'new' health aid programmes do not deserve the ready dismissal they have received in some quarters.||Roger Jeffery

One of the more striking qualities of these myths is their reduction of historical experiences to mere essences. Thus certain qualities of European and American society that were widely observed and imitated in an epoch of advancing capitalism, have come to be accepted as valid for all time. Out of this arises the myth of the superiority of the 'West', a myth that has left its mark not only on the 'underdeveloped' countries but even on a materially advanced country like Japan. This paper tries to indicate some of the specific forms in which this cultural colonialism expresses itself in Japan, something of the 'universal' - but for specific historical reasons 'Western' - cultural norms that the international capitalist system has promoted. Perhaps an acknowledgement of the power of this heritage is necessary before it can be overthrown.||Rajyashree Gokhale

A close look at these studies, however, suggests that they suffer from certain methodological dificiencies which are likely to have imported a significant downward bias into their estimates. The elasticity of the personal income tax in India may, therefore, not be as low as these findings seem to suggest. This paper seeks to examine some of the deficiencies of studies on tax elasticities and offers an alternative estimate of the elasticity of personal income tax. It also raises doubt about the validity of the widely held presumption that a reduction in tax rates leads to a higher yield of income tax because of better compliance.||Amaresh Bagchi,M. Govinda Rao

11/12/1982- ||special article||4371649||Semi-Feudalism or Capitalism? Contemporary Debate on Classes and Modes of Production in India||For over a dozen years Indian and foreign marxists have been arguing with passion, subtlety and an abundance of statistics about the existing mode of production in Indian agriculture or, more broadly, in India. There have been proponents of capitalism, pre-capitalism, semi-feudalism, colonial and post-colonial modes, and recently, a dual mode. From the beginning, the debate has been carried on simultaneously at several levels: that of the individual cultivating unit, that of the agricultural sector of a particular region (e g, Punjab-Haryana or Eastern India) or of India as a whole, that of the entire economy of a region or of India as a whole; that of the colony-metropole relationship or of the imbrication of India in the world economy. A number of authors have brought in freshly gathered field data at the first and second levels to buttress their arguments. Others have drawn upon the vast stock of data available from official sources such as the Farm Management Studies, the National Sample Survey, the Rural Credit Surveys, the Censuses and Agricultural Censuses and the Rural Labour Surveys. Some authors have used historical sources to document their analyses of nineteenth century developments. Several of the economista have employed mathematical models. A handful have restricted themselves to purely theoretical exercises. This paper seeks to delineate the main issues at stake in the debate, embracing modes, forces and relations of production; modes of exploitation; agrarian classes; social formations, contradictions and articulations; movements and dominant tendencies; effects of imperialism and of centre-periphery links; and recommendations for praxis. This is the second part of the paper which is being published in three parts. The first part appeared last week.||Alice Thorner

In contrast, this paper considers the possibility of reducing calorie expenditure, i e, of conserving the energy of the undernourished. This approach to closing the calorie gap must be seriously examined since it is the poorest who eat the least, but have to work the hardest for their survival. This is not proposed as an alternative to increasing food intake, but as an added dimension to any integrated approach to malnutrition - and indeed poverty itself.||Srilatha Batliwala

Subsequently there were conversions in several other villages of the state. This invoked reactions from all sections of society and from June till October 1981 the mass media, political parties, religious organisations, and, not the least, the state and Central government devoted considerable attention to these conversion. This paper attempts to trace the history of religious conversions in India in brief and then to look analytically at the Tamil Nadu. This discussion is in three sections. Section I presents a brief historical background to the phenomenon of conversion in India, specifically to Islam and Christianity, in medieval times and in the period prior to independence. Section II presents an account of the Meenakshipuram conversions and attempts to situate the event against the background of socio-economic characteristics of Hinduism specific in the region where the conversions took place. Section III attempt to analyse the larger reaction to the event and considers some of the problems arising out of 'secularism in practice'; that is, the problems facing an avowedly secular state like India that is predominantly Hindu in its attitude to religious monorities and, more specifically, to proseletysing activities. The paper is being published in two instalments.||George Mathew

Where a decade ago there was considerable divergence between enterprise specific interests and broad societal interests, today the short-term societal and enterprise benefits are less divergent. However, the long-term social costs are shrouded in uncertainty. The choice of indigenous R and D and manufacture of the small tractor over a decade ago have set in motion a process of indigenous technology generation and interest. But the choice now is posed as one of whether to make the product at all.||Ward Morehouse
31/7/1982- ||review of political economy, july 1982||4371181||Of Cabbages and Kings: Economic Theories and Feudal Systems||The project of formulating an 'economic theory of the feudal system' with special reference to 'the operation of market forces in a non-market milieu', which has been put forward by Witold Kula in the book under review, raises the question of the analytical framework of concepts and categories to be used in pursuance of this project. It is not the case that no theory of feudal economy exists at all; on the contrary, in the writings of Marx on pre-capitalist economic formations in general and feudalism in particular and on the historical development of commodities and money, we find the analytical concepts which can serve as the tools for further theorisation (which Marx himself could not complete because his major project was the analysis of the capitalist mode of production). It is from this viewpoint that we examine Kula's project here. We find that a considerable degree of theoretical eclecticism is involved in the propositions Kula puts forward. The concept of necessary and surplus labour are used, but at the same time a diametrically opposite concept of cost of labour in terms of the peasant "not counting his labour" is also employed. Corvee performed by the serf is called labour-rent, but at the same time the sale proceeds of the product of corvee's labour is termed profit to the lord; an 'economic theory of the feudal system' is to be formulated, but this is done without any reference to the theory of absolute ground rent; capitalist profit and feudal rent are treated as synonymous categories. We find, therefore, that there are logical contradictions in the arguments advanced at a number of points, arising from the attempt to use theoretically incompatible concepts. The author's stated project is not realised; and is unlikely to be, unless a consistent theoretical framework is adopted.||Utsa Patnaik

It traces the various parameters that are seen to affect rural development and recommends the viability of this approach within the present economic and political system. Nevertheless, in the long run, the success of the cluster approach, too, would depend on how far the property relations and power structure in the rural sector are altered towards a more egalitarian and homogeneous rural community.||M.

Its failure in this regard stems partly from the exaggerated expectations that had been raised and partly from the many factors which have rendered Budgets an exercise in keeping the Five-Year Plans going as best as possible. The 1982-83 Budget's support to the Sixth Plan is only modestly higher than its predecessor's and even this modest increase has been achieved with great difficulty. While the Budget has taken several steps in the right direction, many of them are taken haltingly, primarily because resource mobilisation is becoming an increasingly difficult exercise.||N. J.

Even if all this has been achieved under the direct or indirect guidance from the IMF (forgetting for the moment official denials, however forceful, that this is not so), how can one object to the Budget on objective considerations?

For wheat, unlike for rice, etc, deviations of state yields around national average narrowed over the years. Also intra-state, or inter-district, variations in yield narrowed in much the same way as inter-state variations. What emerges is that, the more uniform the yields are around the best-practice level, and the less divergences there are between the yields of best-practice farmers and the majority of farmers, the higher is the national average yield. Hence the narrowing of variations in yields among large segments of farmers would be as important as aiming to increase the yields of a nation's best farmers.||P. K. Joshi,Hiromitsu Kaneda

These are basic changes and should be made only after a detailed assessment of the operation of the present income-tax system. Such an assessment should examine the economic impact of the existing system, the administrative problems that have arisen and the legal loopholes that have been identified. While some studies have been made on the latter two aspects, those on the economic impact have not been undertaken in any serious way. An in-depth study needs to be undertaken of the operation of the Income-tax Act, 1961, which is now over two decade old, because the several surgeries it has undergone through the annual Finance Acts, Government notifications and judicial rulings have made income-tax law a complicated and rather irrelevant mess.||V.

These estimates implicitly revise the GNP, per capita and other related statistics for this period. The technique employed has been recently used to determine the size of the unreported economies in USA and Canada. The results indicate that the unreported activity as a proportion of official GNP has grown from 9.5 per cent in 1967 to nearly 49 per cent by 1978. High taxes have contributed significantly to the growth of the unofficial economy. A 1 per cent increase in overall taxes leads to more than 3 per cent increase in the unofficial economy relative to the official economy.||Poonam Gupta,Sanjeev Gupta

The analysis, based on total population counts for 1971 and 1981 (estimates for Assam, where Census operations could not be held in 1981), as well as the sample registration data for estimating likely birth and death rates in the decade, shows that the growth of population in these regions cannot be entirely explained in terms of natural growth unless one accepts an unusually high rate of birth and low rate of death for this region. The unavoidable conclusion, therefore, is that there has been some illegal migration into Eastern India during this decade.||S. Mukerji
03/7/1982- ||special article||4371100||Nomadism as Ideological Expression: The Case of Gomal Nomads||Apart from ecological factors, ideology too plays an important part in determining nomadic behaviour. This paper sees nomadic life as an ideal cultural expression of the larger tribal group - usually sedentary - to which the nomads belong. The Gomal nomads, the subject of this paper, who live in the administrative and social interstices of the larger states of Pakistan and Afghanistan, are nomadic not by accident but by choice, not as victims of ecological conditions but as part of a political strategy. Nomadism is thus seen as an ideological expression and social extension of Pukhtun society reflecting the two major systems within which the Pukhtun organises his life: Pukhtunwali, the Code of the Pukhtuns, and Islam.||Akbar S.

It exists because of a tightly individualistic assessment of mutual interest, as in the case decribed in this paper. Where the benefits are in the form of collective goods and where the continued supply of the collective goods would be put at risk if many were to withdraw, then in many ecological conditions there is a good chance that an organisation will be created and sustained by autonomous action. If acceleration of agricultural growth requires better land development, careful water management, contour bunding and so on, then an attempt to understand the principles on which existing patterns of group action in the countryside are based should have high priority.||Robert Wade

This article examines the issues involved and the character of the forces which were mobilised in opposition to the government's move. It finds that the opposition to abolish English at the primary level is reminiscent of the opposition, led by the Bengal bhadralok, to the moves by the imperial government to create E-grade 'pathasalas' in the nineteenth century and, more generally, to the policy of mass education.||Poromesh Acharya

A brief survey of the early developments in the area of social historiography is followed by an enquiry into the organising principles and implicit assumptions prevalent in different phases of the growth of the discipline. Its aim is not the itemisation of titles published or substantive contributions, but to offer an interpretation of the dominant trends in the hope that it may lead to a critical social history of the discipline of social history. It argues that the task of confronting social history with itself merits attention.||S. Bhattacharya
28/8/1982- ||review of management, august 1982||4371291||Size and Protection: Synthetic Fibres and Yarns Industry in India||This paper analyses the structure of protection on the synthetic fibres and yarns industry in India and in particular the interaction between small plant sizes and high protective barriers. In the first section the level of protection has been estimated and then compared with that in other industries. The second section looks at the effect of small plant sizes in increasing costs of production and thereby necessitating and perpetuating high levels of protection. The synthetic fibres and yarns industry, the author concludes, reveals all the worst effects of a combination of high protective barriers and a restrictive industrial licensing policy. Welfare losses result both from inefficiencies in production and from monopoly profits being earned due to restrictions on the free expansion of the industry. While the present government emphasis on increasing the scale of operations will undoubtedly have beneficial effects, this by itself will not be adequate to make the industry economically efficient. What is required is a package of policies which include removal of restrictive industrial licensing and gradual lowering of high tariff barriers. Only the implementation of such policies can bring about a radical change from the present high cost structure and enable the industry to compete effectively with international producers in the long run.||A.

Institutional practices and traditions generate their own systems of values. Values, in turn, may lead to either flexibility or rigidity in the institutional approach influencing the budgetary process and the emphasis to be placed at various stages of work. This paper analyses institutional, technical and policy factors relating to government budgeting as it concerns the finances of enterprises. Structural aspects relating to both government and enterprise budgets are considered first. The shortcomings of the existing budgetary processes as well as the directions of future reform are indicated in the concluding section.||A. Premchand

The Report was published by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in March 1981 and can be considered the 'official' document on the proposed health programme for the country. This was followed by 'An Alternative Strategy' for 'Health for All' proposed by a Study Group set up jointly by the Indian Council of Social Science Research and the Indian Council of Medical Research, which was in some ways a response to the strategy spelt out by the Ministry of Health Report. This paper undertakes a review and critique of both the Reports, and finds that on the whole the 'alternative strategy' proposed by the ICSSR/ICMR Report has more positive features. It lays particular emphasis on the necessity to involve the people most in need of health care in the implementation of these policies, and notes that the 'alternative strategy' recognises the importance of a 'mass movement' to ensure the implementation of these new strategies.||Malini Karkal

31/7/1982- ||review of political economy, july 1982||4371179||The Indian National Question: A Conceptual Frame||Many marxists maintain (after Stalin) that since Indians possess neither a commonality of language, nor of economic life and mental make-up, the concept of a developing Indian nation is difficult to accept. But the ingredients of a nation or a nationality cannot be so precisely and mechanically listed. A territorial community of culture and/or of nation could evolve in appropriate historical circumstances on the basis of any of a wide range of common identity marks, not all (as for instance, script) being mentioned by Stalin. This paper which attempts to provide a conceptual frame for Indian nationalism argues that India is a union of nationalities, big and small, at varying stages of development. None of these, however, yet by itself forms a nation; nor an autonomous development towards such a singular formation within any of these units is yet in sight. Under big bourgeois-landlord rule, the Indian economy continues to remain backward; and the tangled national question, a reflection of this backwardness, has remained unresolved for lack of democratisation of the society. The problem is further complicated by the fact that the national question in India, as in so many underdeveloped countries, has become a matter of great 'concern' and a special field of operation for neo-colonialist policy makers of metropolitan countries who are coming out as champions of every kind of separatism and ethnic consciousness in underdeveloped countries, with a view to disrupting working class unity and nationality formation process. Keeping these specificities of the Indian case in mind, the paper argues that not onoly a nationality, but also a union of nationalities/national groups could be transformed into a nation through its stable association with the ideal of a unified statehood, desired or realised. India, in this view, is a many-nationality State; and India's several nationalities together form or are tending to from the Indian nation in the making.||Amalendu Guha

The control exercised by the bureaucracy over production, distribution and consumption puts fetters on rapid economic progress. It is in the context of the background of the battle at the shopfloor and factory level, between the drive to increase production and the workers' resistance to it, that one can situate the emergence of Solidarity; and the imposition of martial law represents the culmination of the experiences gained currently and over the three earlier cycles of struggle. This paper traces the current and earlier struggles and analyses the planning processes, issue of workers' control over production process and power structure of the party. The paper notes that Solidarity has failed to develop, in the course of the struggle, its own alternative institutional organs, have its own national conference of shopfloor representatives and experts to draw up a specific programme for economic reform different from that of the party. While it struggled for the most crucial political reforms, if the workers had been allowed to develop their own economic reforms, they might then have imposed voluntary self-discipline and co-operated in austerity measures necessary for economic recovery. But this, the paper suggests, the hardcore faction in the party was bent on preventing. The result is that while the Party is still unable to openly call for the destruction of Solidarity it may try to weed out left-wing currents in the movement and follow a short-sighted corporatist strategy of splits, co-operation and the like. But the strategy, which may seem successful in the short run, will leave unresolved the problems posed and the crisis is bound to recur in a more intensified form. This is the concluding part of the paper which has been published in three parts.||Amrita Chhachhi,Ravi Arvind Palat,Paul Kurian

The purpose of this paper is to indicate how puzzling this puzzle is. The discussion is broadly divided into three parts. In Section II a few general observations are made on the link between macro-economic theory and the definitions of national income and related aggregates. Section III examines the internal consistency of CSO's conceptual framework. In Section IV the author indicates the different types of estimation errors that may arise because of the methods adopted by CSO. In the final section are drawn a few conclusions regarding the possible extent of overestimation in the saving and investment ratios.||Mihir Rakshit

It argues that this superiority lies not only in the relative simplicity of implementing it, but also in the fact that it is in the best interests of sellers and buyers. It suggests that at the fifth UNCTAD conference more positive measures should be taken towards adopting this method of containing variations in commodity prices.||Y. Kalyanraman

This is not altogether surprising. Whereas the Sachar Committee had intended its recommendations to make the MRTP Act more effective in achieving its objective of curbing concentration, monopoly and restrictive trade practices when these are detrimental to the public interest, the government has been preoccupied recently with relaxing and liberalising regulations governing investment activity and business behaviour of private sector enterprises. The government has extended this policy of liberalisation to the MRTP Act by introducing two amendments to the Act in less than a year. This paper critically examines these two amendments and their implications.||A. N. Oza

This paper attempts to compare the capacities of two somewhat different types of minorities, the Indian Muslims and the American jews; to influence their respective countries' positions regarding an area of the greatest interest to both of them, albeit on opposite sides, namely, the Arab-Israeli dispute.||Theodore P.

The results of the author's study indicate that the personnel need to be substantially expanded in number, made more broad-based and dispersed beyond the large-size villages. This, in turn, requires a fresh approach to building up personnel involving departures from the prevailing systems of selection, recruitment, etc, adjusted to the urban setting and conditions. An indicator of some hope is the responsiveness to development shown by village-based personnel who are mostly of rural origin. However, their effectiveness in the field would depend in the final analysis on the strength of the planning system's commitment to rural development and the extent to which the target groups get mobilised to obtain a focal place in the development programmes.||V.

Official research and academic demographic research differ in their opinion on this. The purpose of this article is to show that the omission rates in India have not been very high. However knowledge of the true omission rate may not be enough if we want to assess the true natural growth in the decades. We also find that there has been a significant decline in the 1971-81 growth rate compared to that in the 1961-71 period.||S. Mukerji

1/4/1982- ||the long view||4370833||Economic Crisis and Economic Theory||Keynesian economics has lost much of its effectiveness as a paradigm of world capitalism as a whole, or as a paradigm of individual developed capitalist economies. The decline of the United States as a hegemonic power capable of imposing its will over others has seen to the erosion of the relevance of the Keynesian doctrine on the global scale. The Philips curve and what Hicks calls the 'social' pressure on wages have severely restricted the field of Keynesian policy at home - even though the ruling classes continue to use Keynesian theory as their paradigm. Marxian theory, by contrast, is analytically more powerful. In making the crucial distinction between rent, merchant's profit, and profit and super-profit appropriated by industrial capital, it provides a unified theoretical frame for analysing capitalism on a world scale and on the national level in developed as well as underdeveloped economies.||Ranjit Sau

On the other hand, its adverse effects on our exchange rates, interest rates and domestic money management will be far-reaching and significant. An off-shore centre in India is not necessary to raise funds for financing units in Free Trade Zones or other 'export units'. All reasonable foreign exchange requirements of these units can be met by the present banking channels. Indiscriminate permission to Indian companies to borrow abroad independently will raise our external debt servicing burden to a level that the country may find it difficult to service without surrendering our independence in managing our economy.||S.

It argues here that the crisis stemmed primarily from the socio-economic problems since the commissioning of the Kaptai Dam in early 1961. The intensity of the problem is beginning to increase with new industrialisation and economic policies for 'resource appropriation' for the benefit of the national economy with little or no participation by the local tribesmen. The insurgencies in the Chittagong Hill Tracts are but processes of politicisation and ethnicisation of the local population. The paper suggests that solutions lie in the recognition of their ethnic identity and local autonomy rather than pursuing the current governmental policies which have tended to be more toward detribalisation.||M.

This article attempts a critical assessment of these organisations, and points out that the crisis, in spite of 'methodological' differences between the organisations, is essentially the same from the beginning of the movement in 1945. Section I begins with a brief description of the early years of the movement and hints at the crisis. Section II develops the theme by ascribing a specific relation between the post colonial State, the organisations and the Varlis. Section III expands the theme of the crisis suggested in the earlier sections.||Ashok K. Upadhyaya

To aid this development effort, there has been large-scale import of capital and technology from the developed countries and the international lending institutions. The justification usually offered for this pattern of dairy development is two-fold: first, if the traditional technology of dairy production is continued it will result in the years to come in significant decline in per capita milk production and, consequently, in the nutritional standards of the population; secondly, increasing investment in the dairy sector will be beneficial more to the vulnerable than to the rich sections of the population. Whether the pattern of dairy development emerging in these countries does in fact meet the attainment of these objectives has been a subject of extensive debate in recent years [Sha et al, 1980; Huria and Achaya 1980; Rajapurohit 1979; S Singh 1979; Nair 1980]. However, it seems to us that some of the major issues associated with technological change in dairying have not surfaced clearly in these discussions. It is our intention in this paper to undertake a fresh look at a few of such critical issues underlying the technology of dairy production in the south Asian countries. In Section I, we examine the effect of technology on production and the conditions under which introduction of technology would lead to the development of successful dairying. In section II, the distributive effect of dairy development is analysed in some detail.||K. Narayanan Nair

Why is it, then, that such an important sector has been contributing so little to the savings of the economy? This paper examines (1) why the share of the private corporate sector in total domestic savings is so low, and (2) why this share has fallen in recent years.||N. Shanta

20/3/1982- ||special articles||4370792||Demotion of the Budget||The budget as an instrument of economic policy and action has been devalued in recent years. Major changes in fiscal matters are introduced by executive decisions, sometimes even when the presentation of the budget is imminent. When the budget becomes unimportant, the need for framing it carefully disappears. It is this that is patent in the Budget for 1982-83, which lacks any conceptual coherence and appears to be only a collection of many proposals, most of which are of an inconsequential nature. Like the extra-budgetary measures adopted prior to the presentation of the Budget, there will follow piecemeal policy decisions from time to time and there may be some intermediate fiscal changes also. Both qualitatively and quantitatively, these ad hoc measures may add up to a larger impact than the Budget itself involves. The Budget has thus been made practically useless in determining how far we have still to go to achieve the modest Sixth Plan tragets of output, employment and income distribution.||Bhabatosh Datta

This study fills this gap by providing estimates of unaccounted income for a period of 17 years. There has been a secular rise in unaccounted income. It rose more than ten-fold in a decade and a half. We have attempted an explanation of this phenomenon with the help of two models. The results corroborate the hypothesis that tax evasion is more likely the higher the rate of taxation. Further, the results confirm the hypothesis that an increase in prices leads to an increase in the proportion of unaccounted income to total income. Furthermore the results suggest that funds are diverted to agriculture to convert unaccounted income into legal income.||O. P. Chopra

In essence, it is a review and critique of some recent publications on the question which, in the author's view, have tended to be populist and even partisan. It agrees that there are gaps in the Indian case on the border, but argues that the Chinese case is even more tenuous. On the basis of the evidence to hand, the Indian presentation of its case is in fact far superior to its Chinese counterpart. However, whatever view one might take of the historical details, what is more urgent is to break the present deadlock on the border. Seen thus, the current debate in India on the India-China border dispute may actually help normalise the relations between the two countries.||Parshotam Mehra
12/6/1982- ||special articles||4371023||Character of an Urban Economy: 'Small-Scale' Production and Labour Markets in Coimbatore||Based on field research in Coimbatore in 1980, this paper discusses several theories concerning the character and role of 'small-scale' production in relation to the industrial economy as a whole. A distinction is made between small capitalist units of production and 'petty commodity producer' units. The patterns of ownership and financing of both types of units are considered, and the character of the linkages between different forms of production is examined in some detail. The extent of subcontracting between big capital industries and small units is shown to be considerable, and the interests of big industry in the splitting up of production processes in order to tighten the control of labour are demonstrated. The backgrounds and social characteristics of workers in different levels of industry, in casual work and in self-employment are also analysed; and the degree of segmentation existing within the labour market is shown to be high. Conclusions are drawn on the processes of reproduction of different forms of small-scale production; and it is argued that while they are subordinated in various ways to big capital production their persistence is ensured by the interests of big capital itself, and by the structure of markets, in particular. The paper has been published in two parts. The first part which appeared last week, dealt with patterns of ownership and financing, linkages between different forms of production, sub-contracting and splitting up of production processes. This second part deals with the backgrounds and social characteristics of workers and the degree of segmentation in the labour market and also presents the author's conclusions.||John Harriss
08/5/1982- ||special articles||4370893||The Budget, Money and Credit: A Macroeconometric Analysis||The authors here present a model of the fiscal and monetary sectors of the Indian economy for short-term macro economic forecasting and policy formulation and, in particular, for analysing the implications of the annual budget of the Central government for the economy at large. The effect of the budget on certain key macro variables such as money, credit and inflation is sought to be studied with the help of the model It is seen that many of the policy variables in the monetary sector which earlier investigations seemed to find insignificant can in fact be important and effective instruments in the hands of policy-makers. It is also found that in formulating its interest rate policy, it is futile for the central bank to raise or lower all rates of interest by a common factor - it needs, instead, to use an appropriate structure of differential interest rates to achieve its stated objectives. The authors' fiscal sector equations go to show why actual budget deficits differ from those estimated by the Finance Ministry. Here the results obtained highlight how important feedback effects from the real sector are and, consequently, the need for the government to be able to accurately predict inflation and the growth rate of the economy.||Srinivasa Madhur,Pulin Nayak,Prannoy Roy

Contemporary Debate on Classes and Modes of Production in India||For over a dozen years Indian and foreign marxists have been arguing with passion, subtlety and an abundance of statistics about the existing mode of production in Indian agriculture or, more broadly, in India. There have been proponents of capitalism, pre-capitalism, semi-feudalism, colonial and post-colonial modes, and recently, a dual mode. From the beginning, the debate has been carried on simultaneously at several levels: that of the individual cultivating unit, that of the agricultural sector of a particular region (e g, Punjab-Haryana or Eastern India) or of India as a whole, that of the entire economy of a region or of India as a whole; that of the colony-metropole relationship or of the imbrication of India in the world economy. A number of authors have brought in freshly gathered field data at the first and second levels to buttress their arguments. Others have drawn upon the vast stock of data available from official sources such as the Farm Management Studies, the National Sample Survey, the Rural Credit Surveys, the Censuses and Agricultural Censuses and the Rural Labour Surveys. Some authors have used historical sources to document their analyses of nineteenth century developments. Several of the economists have employed mathematical models. A handful have restricted themselves to purely theoretical exercises. This paper seeks to delineate the main issues at stake in the debate, embracing modes, forces and relations of production; modes of exploitation; agrarian classes; social formations, contradictions and articulations; movements and dominant tendencies; effects of imperialism and of centre-periphery links; and recommendations for praxis. This is the third and last part of the paper which has been published in three parts.||Alice Thorner

1/4/1982- ||the long view||4370830||Long-Term Stagnation in the Indian Economy, 1900-75||The Indian experience since independence seems to be in flagrant contradiction with the orthodox Western theories of economic development, e g, Nurkse's vicious circle of poverty. Arthur Lewis' idea on the transition from a 6 per cent to a 12 per cent saving investment rate being the key to economic development, the two-gap model justifying large inflows of foreign governmental or private capital, etc. Over the long haul and on a per capital basis primary output has declined while secondary output has increased to an equivalent extent so that NMP has remained stable. Tertiary output and NDP have generally gone up. These are true irrespective of the base year prices chosen, i e, those of 1960-61 or 1948-49 or 1938-39. There is evidence of capital-deepening in the economy as a whole and in the large industrial sector. Not only in the aggregate, but also for some of the major branches of industry, there is a tendency for both capital-labour and capital-output ratios to rise. As a result, increases in the aggregate rate of savings and investment are not reflected in a quickening of output growth. Data for the period 1900-75 indicate that a high growth rate in industry is to be found only when its terms of trade vis-a-vis agriculture are not too far below their long-run 'normal' levels. However, while a sharp adverse movement in the terms of trade in the mid-1960s did precipitate a crisis in industry and the terms continue to remain unfavourable, other factors of a more endemic nature are at least as important in explaining the prolonged recession in industry. The other factors boil down to the low purchasing power of the masses. Real wages in agriculture have hardly gone up since 1900, whereas in large industry these may have increased by a small margin in the post-independence period. The rate of employment of the potential labour force has gone down in a secular fashion, implying increasing underutilisation of labour. There are serious unresolved problems in gauging the extent of poverty over time, but there is no evidence that it has diminished. It seems highly probable that the distribution of private consumer expenditure has become more skewed, considering the income elasticities and the growing availability of 'luxury' items. Examination of income distribution between classes within each of the major sectors, primary, secondary and tertiary, is inconclusive but there is a weak suggestion of widening disparities. The phenomenal rise in the saving rate since the early 1950s, however, leaves, little room for doubt on this score. Public fixed investments appear to have increased since the mid-1960s, but once appropriate adjustments are made this proposition is seen to be not quite valid. It is doubtful whether the volume of private investments depends as much as before on the size of investment outlays by the public sector. A mere expansion in public investment is, therefore, unlikely to bring the economy on to a higher growth trajectory.||Nirmal Kumar Chandra

To do so he needs to be able to undertake by himself all functional operations such as procuring raw materials, finance and marketing. This is highly unlikely to happen with the individual efforts of resource-poor workers, especially if their product is a day-to-day consumer item to be marketed amidst severe competition. External support in terms of finance, raw material supply, organisational umbrella, and market assistance is crucial to them. Though the workers in this case showed a favourable response to institutional patronage and support of an external agency (the KVIC) they could not be nursed into self-sustaining entrepreneurs as the support institution was too ill-equipped - in terms of infrastructure, people and funds - for the task. It could not, in advance, comprehend the necessity and importance of building a distribution network and acquiring a hold on the market, nor did it anticipate other stumbling blocks like raw material shortage and complexities of quality control. When it lost the hold over the market function - the crucial rein - all other development measures failed to push the programme to success. The target group turned out to be feeble entrepreneurs whose earnings and positions showed little improvement.||T. K. Moulik,P. Purushotham

Since there is a relationship sought to be established between 'trends in rural poverty' and 'agricultural growth', with consequent implications for policy, it is all the more important to be clear whether estimates of poverty and trends in it are correct. A re-examination here of the figures of the extent of poverty suggests that there has been an overestimation of it.||D. S. Tyagi

It puts down certain broad and preliminary observations, based on secondary materials, which appear to have interesting implications. The two questions that have compelled the attention of Indian economists are: (a) The persistent slackening of the Indian economy - what some have characterised as 'structural retrogression' - noticeable particularly after the mid-sixties. (b) The deepening interregional imbalances that are increasingly expressing themselves in the form of social and political tensions. The interregional differences have their explanation basically in the same causal forces which explain also the overall rate and pattern of growth of the collective economy, although, no doubt, there are conjunctural specificities of individual regions.||Krishna Bharadwaj

This paper, based on a field study, concludes on a similar note and shows how low administrative priority as reflected in sluggish personnel posting and frequent transfers, ineffective mechanisms of co-ordination and review, and poor monitoring, were responsible for poor performance of the ANP.||Amal Ray,Vanita Venkatasubhiah

06/2/1982- ||special articles||4370652||1981 Census Economic Data: A Note||The workforce participation rates in the 1981 census show a rise over those of the 1971 census. However, they remain for below the long-term trend obtained from census data from 1901 to 1961. They are also significantly lower than the comparable rates obtained from recent rounds of NSS. The 1981 census enumeration of workers thus clearly remains a relative undercount. More important, there is a systematic pattern of relatively heavier undercount in the backward states. Analysis of the industrial distribution of workers revealed by the 1981 census brings out that the proportion of non-agricultural workers was almost the same in 1961 and 1971 but showed a rise in 1981. However, after adjustment for under-enumeration of workers there is no significant change in the period 1961-1981. This is consistent with the evidence provided by the current-weekly status data obtained from NSS in 1973 and 1978.||J. N. Sinha

This article argues that, in good crop years, both the cane and the sugar control prices should be revised downward. As decontrol after 1977-78's excellent crop had pulled down prices, pushed up demand, and wiped out the buffer stock, a carefully worked depression of prices in good years would help all these interests - consumers, mills, and growers. In the meantime, as growers become more organised they will be able to protect their prices and returns.||Arun Kumar

The ban on conversion and the refusal to accept as Parsis the children of Parsi women married to non-Parsis eliminates other possible avenues of adding to the community's population. Previous studies have relied on census data, or have followed the descriptive survey design without any attempt at applying experimental controls. Data on men are also generally lacking because of the emphasis on fertility problems. The present study follows the explanatory survey design, using a rural/urban sampling frame. An effort is also made here to experimentally divide the population into those who are likely to marry vs those whose marriage prospects are nil. The findings demonstrate that many stereotypical views of the never-married Parsis are erroneous. Section I describes the methodology. Section II examines some basic demographic characteristics, and then deals with significant differences between those 'likely' and those 'unlikely' to get married. Furthermore, the reasons given by the 'unlikely' group for non-marriage are analysed. Section III discusses the significance of the results.||Ketayun H. Gould

25/9/1982- ||special articles||4371402||Morphology of Urbanisation in India: Some Results from 1981 Census||The Provisional Population Totals of the 1981 Census reveal a marked acceleration in the pace of urbanisation in India during the decade 1971-81. This paper seeks to place this development in its proper perspective, both in relation to past trends in India as well as in relation to the urbanisation experience of other developing countries. Further understanding of the emerging pattern of urbanisation is sought by the disaggregation of trends upto the state and sub-regional level. It is evident that there has been a marked acceleration in the rate of urban growth in India according to all conventional measurements but that it is still slow as compared with the rest of the world. It is striking that India exhibits a very stable settlement structure such that much of the urban growth that has occurred has been because of the accretion to existing towns and settlements and only marginally because of the emergence of new towns. As a result, the proportion of urban population residing in towns above a certain population cut-off point continues to increase, but there is little evidence of correlation between city size and rates of population growth. Examination of regional and state level data are quite illuminating. The relatively poorer states have urbanised faster than the old industrially advanced states like West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. There are diversities within the large poor states such as UP, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. The sub-regions with heavy industrial investments such as southern Bihar and eastern Madhya Pradesh show very high urban growth rates and correspondingly low rural growth rates. Agriculturally stagnating regions like eastern UP and northern Bihar in the northern Gangetic Plain also show high rates of urban growth but along with relatively high rural growth rates as well. Agriculturally prosperous regions like Punjab, Haryana and Western UP, exhibit marked declines in rural population growth rates along with an acceleration in urban growth. Hence the phenomenon of overall acceleration in urban growth in India has rather diverse causes which have to be understood at the regional level. This paper is being published in two parts. The first part, which appeared last week, examined the urbanisation record in India since 1901 and the pattern of growth of towns and cities. The second part of the paper, published below, analyses the regional pattern of urban growth and also attempts an interpretation of urbanisation in India.||Rakesh Mohan,Chandrashekhar Pant

This article considers the different proposals put forward by India (a Ganga-Brahmaputra link canal) and Bangladesh (dams and reservoirs in Nepal and a navigation canal between Nepal and Bagladesh) for the augmentation of the Ganga waters and their implications and argues that the dispute is no longer simply about the Ganga but is a battle between international capital and India's rich peasantry for river development in pursuit of their respective interests.||Ben Crow

This has come about 15 years after a national satellite system was conceptualised, a number of system studies carried out, and pilot projects undertaken. This paper examines the evolution of the original plan for the Indian National Satellite to utilise space technology for developmental purposes, and the experimentation process to test the concept through a pilot project. The reasons for the changes in the original plan, and the problems of implementation of the current plan, are then considered. Further, the efforts of space scientists to demonstrate the relevance of space technology and the implications of a system such as INSAT for organisational and infrastructural problems related to development, are looked into. The focus is mainly on the TV component.||Ashok Raj,C. Vishnu Mohan

It is no longer primarily an exporter, and its home market is steadily and surely increasing. And if its input prices are high it is because the trading interests of the jute monopolists ensure themselves a fat margin between what the jute grower is paid and the industry pays for the raw jute. The wage payment system for the jute workers is also irrational. Unfortunately, the government has generally pandered to the public image of itself propagated by the jute industry. Progressive organisation of the jute growers, institutional credit for official jute purchases, modernisation of the jute industry in keeping with the emerging pattern of demand, a more scientific wage payment structure, and a compact between India and Bangladesh in international sale of jute goods, are all necessary for a better and more viable reorganisation of the jute industry.||Ajit Sengupta

Redistribution of income is the most effective instrument in achieving the primary objective of provision of basic needs. But as admitted in the Technical Note on the Sixth Plan, "the income distribution and the production structure of the economy are not yet explicitly functionally related". Recently some preliminary attempt has been made to construct a matrix showing distribution of sectoral value added by six different income classes. In this regard it is high time that the Planning Commission should go in for developing a closed loop formulation on a firm basis. Secondly, an expanded capital flow matrix to estimate the requirement of different capital goods should be built up and used to ensure consistency among the sectoral growth from consideration of both current inputs and capital inputs. Thirdly, both Fifth and Sixth Plan models assume constant prices, whereas higher tax rates, increased money supply and other internal and external factors bring in inflationary pressure causing erosion of real content of the plan resources and deceleration of growth. This vital aspect of Indian planning process needs immediate attention.||K. C. Majumdar,M. K. Panda

Gold price traced out two principal cycles during the decade - moving up from 1971 it reached a peak in December 1974, then fell till the third quarter of 1976, rose again till early 1980, after which it fell up to June 1982. Several developments in world economy could have influenced these movements in gold prices. The author's study has, however, led them to conclude that the gold price cycles in the last decade were generated principally by speculative behaviour which, in turn, was influenced by cyclical forces in the world economic system. Specifically, the impact of three factors - inflationary expectations, exchange rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates - possibly influencing speculation in gold is discussed.||I. S.

03/7/1982- ||special articles||4371103||Movement towards Workers' Democracy: Solidarity in Poland||THE struggle by the working class in Poland, of which there have been three earlier manifestations (1956, 1970-71 and 1976), is located in problems which originate in the specific form in which production is organised. The control exercised by the bureaucracy over production, distribution and consumption puts fetters on rapid economic progress. It is in the context of the background of the battle at the shopfloor and factory level, between the drive to increase production and the workers' resistance to it, that one can situate the emergence of Solidarity; and the imposition of martial law represents the culmination of the experiences gained currently and over the three earlier cycles of struggle. This paper traces the current and earlier struggles and analyses the planning processes, issue of workers' control over production process and power structure of the party. The paper notes that Solidarity has failed to develop, in the course of the struggle, its own alternative institutional organs, have its own national conference of shopfloor representatives and experts to draw up a specific programme for economic reform different from that of the party. While it struggled for the most crucial political reforms, if the workers had been allowed to develop their own economic reforms, they might then have imposed voluntary self-discipline and co-operated in austerity measures necessary for economic recovery. But this, the paper suggests, the hardcore faction in the party was bent on preventing. The result is that while the Party, is still unable to openly call for, the destruction of Solidarity it may try to weed out left-wing currents in the movement and follow a short-sighted corporatist strategy of splits, co-optation and the like. But the strategy, which may seem successful in the short run, will leave unresolved the problems posed and the crisis is bound to recur in a more intensified form. This is the second part of the paper which is being published in three parts.||Amrita Chhachhi,Ravi Arvind Palat,Paul Kurien

In other words, what is the validity of the census data which constitute the observation of fewer females than males in India? (2) How, or through what mechanisms, is the sex ratio produced? Is the sex ratio at birth, which customarily averages 105 males per 100 females, inexplicably different in India in comparison to other regions? Or is mortality the culprit? (3) Why does the low sex ratio arise? What are the various social, political, economic and environmental forces which operate either individually or in concert to produce biological damage? (4) And finally, assuming that the deteriorating sex ratio is undesirable from a public welfare perspective, what can be done about the problems? An attempt is made in this paper to offer some insights on these issues on the basis of evidence gathered in Bangladesh.||Lincoln C. Chen

It is hoped that such an exercise might contribute to a more informed discussion about policies, options and prospects for the future. Section II of the paper outlines the trends in India's balance of payments over the three decades from 1950 to 1980. The focus of the paper, however, is on the last decade. Section III examines the dramatic changes in the payments situation during the 1970s and seeks to analyse the underlying factors. Section IV provides an assessment of the present payments crisis, and considers the possibilities and prospects over the next few years. To situate the problem in its wider perspective, Section V attempts to examine, very briefly, the macro-economics of India's balance of payments. Section VI concludes the paper with some observations about the shifts in emphasis and the changes in direction of trade policies; in doing so, it places the balance of payments problem in the context of industrialisation strategy.||Deepak Nayyar
