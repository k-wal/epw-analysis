It argues that an understanding of the political economy of imperialism is necessary to adequately characterise these linkages. What is termed as the resultant technological polarisation is then illustrated with reference to social forestry and to largescale fishing enterprises in India.||Vandana Shiva,J. Bandyopadhyay

The required calculations for profitability are made on the assumption of expected level of operations of the project, generally, called 'normal capacity utilisation'. But entrepreneurs are seldom sure that normal capacity will be utilised in actual operations. Internal organisational and environmental uncertainties force entrepreneurs to ask: What if the project does not run at the assumed capacity level? Will the project be in a position to at least recover its costs? These risk-induced questions motivate the calculation of BEP. This paper emphasises that BEP is essentially a risk-measure. Once it is appreciated that BEP is a risk-measure, it is pertinent to examine its relationship with other risk-measures often in use in investment decision making. This paper examines this relationship and puts BEP in the proper perspective in the risk-theory. In the process, the contributions in the area of 'break-even analysis under uncertainty' are critically reviewed.||Satya Prakash Singh,Jayant V. Deshpande

One refers to a human region as defined by outside observers, based on their perceptions and taxonomy, using general 'etic' criteria to specify its nature and extent. The other is the region as perceived by participants in it, as understood in the insiders 'emic' perceptions as engaging their sense of identity and attracting their loyalties. A person normally identifies with several regions, of narrower or wider scope; one's loyalties are made manifest to a closer region in a particular situation, to a broader one in a different context. Each of these two types of regions takes in a different kind of reality, but not totally separate realities. People who share the same terrain and climate, who cope with like environmental conditions, who have similar cultural proclivities, have some common ground for developing a degree of common identity. That degree is enhanced if they see themselves as together confronting a mutual threat, whether of nature or of another set of people. True, spatial propinquity has often enough bred hostility and cultural proximity is no bar to enmity. Yet, on balance, both conditions generally favour the development of social and cultural bonds. The peoples and the terrain of the Nilgiri plateau have long attracted interest because of their unusual characteristics. Throughout three principal periods - aboriginal, colonial, national independence - the Nilgiri region has constituted a singular and singularly instructive enclave, a distinctive locale as perceived by observers as well as by its inhabitants.||David G.

Pulses as a group can utilise limited soil moisture and nutrients more efficiently than cereal crops and for that reason farmers have chosen them to grow under highly adverse conditions. The process of differential resource allocation to pulse crops operates at agro-ecological niche allocation and at individual farmers level, out of necessity, and not out of choice or preference. At present more than 92 per cent of the area under pulses is confined to unirrigated areas, and in future the bulk of pulse production will continue to come from unirrigated areas. Therefore, any plan for increasing pulse production in the country should be based on a long-term approach for improved productivity of these crops under rainfed farming conditions rather than on the use of high inputs. Crop productivity comparisons made under unirrigated conditions between pulses and cereals do not support the general belief that pulses suffer from inherent low productivity. Rather the low productivity of pulses is due to the low input conditions associated with the complex socio-economic and agroclimatic problems of rainfed agriculture. Long neglect of rainfed areas has resulted in poor institutional development and, therefore, there is considerable lag in developing strong traditions of scientific thinking and research, and training of scientists to work in these areas. This para deals in detail with agroclimatic, socio-economic and biological constraints of pulse production and gaps in transfer of technology in rainfed areas.||D. Sharma,N. S. Jodha

Certain analytical devices are first formulated to make clear distinctions among the components of irrigation systems and these are then applied to a concrete case. The authors have selected Kanyakumari district for their case study, mainly because scarcity of water and consequent crop failures have been frequent in the tail-end areas of this district in recent years. The last section of the paper briefly outlines some issues thrown up by the study which call for further research.||D. Narayana,V. C. V. Ratnam,K. Narayanan Nair
03/7/1982- ||special article||4371100||Nomadism as Ideological Expression: The Case of Gomal Nomads||Apart from ecological factors, ideology too plays an important part in determining nomadic behaviour. This paper sees nomadic life as an ideal cultural expression of the larger tribal group - usually sedentary - to which the nomads belong. The Gomal nomads, the subject of this paper, who live in the administrative and social interstices of the larger states of Pakistan and Afghanistan, are nomadic not by accident but by choice, not as victims of ecological conditions but as part of a political strategy. Nomadism is thus seen as an ideological expression and social extension of Pukhtun society reflecting the two major systems within which the Pukhtun organises his life: Pukhtunwali, the Code of the Pukhtuns, and Islam.||Akbar S.

25/9/1982- ||review of agriculture, september 1982||4371396||Group Action for Irrigation||There is far more autonomous voluntary group action for economic ends in the Indian countryside than is generally thought to be the case. It exists because of a tightly individualistic assessment of mutual interest, as in the case decribed in this paper. Where the benefits are in the form of collective goods and where the continued supply of the collective goods would be put at risk if many were to withdraw, then in many ecological conditions there is a good chance that an organisation will be created and sustained by autonomous action. If acceleration of agricultural growth requires better land development, careful water management, contour bunding and so on, then an attempt to understand the principles on which existing patterns of group action in the countryside are based should have high priority.||Robert Wade

This article considers the different proposals put forward by India (a Ganga-Brahmaputra link canal) and Bangladesh (dams and reservoirs in Nepal and a navigation canal between Nepal and Bagladesh) for the augmentation of the Ganga waters and their implications and argues that the dispute is no longer simply about the Ganga but is a battle between international capital and India's rich peasantry for river development in pursuit of their respective interests.||Ben Crow

In other words, what is the validity of the census data which constitute the observation of fewer females than males in India? (2) How, or through what mechanisms, is the sex ratio produced? Is the sex ratio at birth, which customarily averages 105 males per 100 females, inexplicably different in India in comparison to other regions? Or is mortality the culprit? (3) Why does the low sex ratio arise? What are the various social, political, economic and environmental forces which operate either individually or in concert to produce biological damage? (4) And finally, assuming that the deteriorating sex ratio is undesirable from a public welfare perspective, what can be done about the problems? An attempt is made in this paper to offer some insights on these issues on the basis of evidence gathered in Bangladesh.||Lincoln C. Chen
