Such an analytical exercise also reveals that South Asia is potentially the most contentious arena for India–China relations. A limited Sino–Indian geopolitical accommodation in the immediate neighbourhood is both viable and necessary to arrest the deterioration in the bilateral relationship in recent years and ensure regional stability.||Zorawar Daulet Singh

This has prompted LNG traders to reconfigure the market dynamics and the contractual framework between them. Consequently, there is a visible shift from a rigid oil-linked gas price to a flexible gas-on-gas price competition, which has contributed to increased global LNG demand.||Manish Vaid,Darshit Paun

The Akhilesh Yadav government has showcased its strategies and achievements through public advertisements. Given that all major parties in the fray have been in power in the state at some time or another, this article examines UP’s record of growth and development over the long run, and over specific sub-periods linked to various political regimes. It specifically examines how growth strategies, focused on industrial and infrastructure growth, have evolved since the early 1990s, poor governance has influenced the general development scenario as well as the impact of “social justice” oriented governments on socially inclusive development.||Ravi Srivastava,Rahul Ranjan

With a decline of identity politics in the state, the major political parties are trying to outdo each other in engineering alliances, reaching out to hitherto neglected, marginalised groups, under the garb of inclusive politics. Sensing an opportunity, these backward groups are turning away from their identity-based political anchors and being drawn towards parties that promise political and economic empowerment, signalling the beginning of the “third democratic upsurge” in UP.||A K Verma

With the Hindutva card unlikely to cut much ice with the backward castes and Dalits, it is crucial for the BJP, to calibrate its campaign strategy to offer these less empowered communities more political representation to reap electoral dividends in the impending polls.||Radhika Ramaseshan

This misconception has given rise to several wild theories about how Muslims participate in electoral arena—that they vote in large numbers, their decision of whom to vote for is influenced by clerics, they are more concerned about religious issues while voting, and are less supportive of India’s political institutions. This article presents a body of evidence using public opinion and election returns data from Uttar Pradesh to show that the political and electoral behaviour of Muslims is no different from that of any other major community in the state.||Rahul Verma,Pranav Gupta

Based on a survey of over 7,000 households, representing all socio-religious groups in 14 districts of the state, the article assesses these changes and points to the disparities between the various groups and, more importantly, to the intra-group inequalities that exist within each group. To effectively mobilise support, political parties will have to look beyond the numbers and recognise the acute differences existing within castes.||Prashant K Trivedi,Srinivas Goli,Fahimuddin,Surinder Kumar
30-12-2016||uttar pradesh—vortex of change||---------||The Demand for Division of Uttar Pradesh and Its Implications||Significant interregional development disparities plaguing Uttar Pradesh today are often attributed to its large and unwieldy size. There is a strong prima facie case for the division of the state into smaller units to improve governance and development. But the demand for the state’s division, raised from time to time by all major parties except the Samajwadi Party, has presently receded into the background in the absence of mass support for it from any region. In the political discourse surrounding the 2017 UP assembly elections, it appears unlikely that restructuring of the state into manageable units will emerge as a significant issue.||Ajit Kumar Singh

30-12-2016||special articles||---------||Rehabilitation Policy : A Field Study of Ex-militants in Kashmir||In the early 1990s, after decades of political discontent, thousands of Kashmiri men travelled across the Line of Control for arms training to seek independence from India. However, soon many became disillusioned and looked at the possibilities of return. In 2010, the Government of Jammu and Kashmir announced a rehabilitation policy for them. However, the ex-militants generally avoid the designated points mainly to evade possible arrest by the Indian security forces and the cumbersome documentation process. This article argues that the criterion for return through these points is flawed, since it has failed to attract ex-militants, and those who returned through other points were not entitled to the benefits of the rehabilitation policy.||Sameer Yasir,Meha Dixit
30-12-2016||special articles||---------||Contours of Access to Water and Sanitation in India : Drawing on the Right to Live with Human Dignity||Improving the access to water and sanitation for all sections of society has been a significant development priority in recent decades in India and the same has been juxtaposed with advocacy for water and sanitation to be recognised as the legal human rights. However, very limited attention has been paid to seeing water and sanitation as a legal right for the populace, despite the debate over the abysmally low indicators of hygienic parameters for the vulnerable sections of society. Whereas Article 21 of the Constitution enunciates Right to Life in its multidimensional manifestations, including the right to safe drinking water, reflections on the findings of the NSS 69th round (which looks at the conditions of drinking water and sanitation in India, among other things) critically examines the availability of the water and conditions of sanitation for Indians. The right to water does not mean mere availability of water but water of standard quality so as to ensure healthy life of an individual. This article attempts to assess the hygienic conditions from the point of view of international benchmarks as also the effectiveness of rights provided under the Constitution and in other statutory documents with regard to water and sanitation.||Pankaj K P Shreyaskar

Considered a “crisis” level, this led to an intense study of the causes of youth suicide as well as intensive efforts to devise public health programmes to assist young people at the risk of suicide. Reaching a peak in 1991, teenage male suicide rates have fallen steadily and are now less than 10 per lakh. In India, youth suicide rates vary greatly between states for males and females. For young males, suicide rates in 28, and for females in 12 states and union territories were at or above the crisis level. Yet there has been virtually no public recognition of the level or seriousness of youth suicide.||
23-12-2016||special articles||---------||Decentralising Accountability : Anti-corruption Experiment from Sikkim||Ensuring good governance while devolving the 3Fs— functions, funds and functionaries—is a formidable challenge. An action research conducted in Sikkim from 2010 to 2016 focused on four questions: where is the corruption, what are the different types of corruption, how much is the quantum, and how do we reduce it effectively? A set of anti-corruption tools was integrated in the programme delivery, and corruption practices were broadly grouped into “easy to prevent,” “difficult to prevent but easy to detect,” and “difficult to prevent and detect.” By applying this strategy, we found that the corruption level dropped more than three times from 1.74% to 0.55%, and the savings from sanctioned cost rose to 20% (₹30.16 crore). This reduction was achieved despite weak enforcement, highlighting that a dynamic anti-corruption strategy that increases the probability of being caught can significantly reduce corruption by decentralising accountability.||Sandeep Tambe,Ash Bahadur Subba,Jigme Basi,Sarika Pradhan,B B Rai Sandeep Tambe

This study reveals that these demands do not address the source of Maratha distress—stagnation of farm incomes and the failure of the government to improve agricultural productivity.

Yet this hierarchical system of credit/social relations appears to us as a system of fiat money. This fetish of fiat money, analogous to Marx’s commodity fetish, is produced in the operation of credit system. The institutional and political arrangements of the Indian state amplify this inherent fetish. This conjuncture of elements produces a particularly robust fetish of fiat money in India, giving the Indian state more degrees of freedom over money than other states enjoy, a margin that the current government is now exploiting.||

The special economic zones policy of the state actively promoted corporate-led industrialisation promising employment, and creating aspirations among young workers. There was no accountability or labour-centred exit policies factored into the state's industrial policies when state governments welcomed private investments. With the closure of Nokia, not only have promises been broken, but its workers and supply companies have lost their livelihoods and future possibilities of work.||Madhumita Dutta
15-12-2016||special articles||---------||Land Acquisition : Need for a Shift in Discourse?||Empirical work by researchers increasingly finds that farmers are willing to sell their land if the price-compensation package is "acceptable." This article takes an introductory review of different frameworks like accumulation by dispossession, political society/civil society, reversal of the effects of primitive accumulation; and double movement in the context of land acquisition. With farmers wanting to move out of agriculture in a big way and looking for alternatives, there is a need to accept the farmers' willingness to be partners in the developmental processes. At the same time, largely due to the protest movements and the concomitant violence, the state is becoming more accommodating of the demands for better compensation. In such a situation, a covenant between the state and land needs to emerge.||Dhanmanjiri Sathe

These issues are not addressed by demonetisation and do not justify the suffering this move has unleashed on the poor and the middle classes.||Kobad Ghandy
08-12-2016||insight||---------||Water Crisis in Punjab and Haryana : Politics of Sutlej–Yamuna Link Canal||After the Green Revolution, Punjab and Haryana have become water-scarce states due to the introduction of paddy as the main kharif crop, a massive increase in cropping intensity, and rapid urbanisation and industrialisation. However, the real issue--of reverting to sustainable cropping patterns and improving water-use efficiency--remains unaddressed. An improvement of 15% to 20% in water-use efficiency from the present level can provide each state with the increased water share it is demanding.||Sucha Singh Gill
08-12-2016||special articles||---------||Water War between Punjab and Haryana : A Geographical Insight||Much has been said and written about sharing of river waters between Punjab and Haryana from time to time since the reorganisation of the state of Punjab in 1966. Various agreements, accords, tribunals, commissions and water sharing formulas have been worked out time to time, but the problem still remains unsolved. Haryana is stressing for the completion of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link to carry its share of surplus Ravi-Beas water (3.5 million acre-feet) awarded to it in 1976, while Punjab argues that it has no surplus water to share with Haryana, and is adopting various measures to check this outflow of water. Such awards and agreements are generally politically-induced, and therefore, remain unimplemented. This study highlights the ground realities related to irrigation to evaluate the claims and counterclaims of both the states.||H S Mangat
08-12-2016||special articles||---------||Recent Trends in Wealth Inequality in India||An analysis of the trends in wealth ownership and its inequality in India between 1991 and 2012 using three rounds of All-India Debt and Investment Survey data reveals a greater concentration of wealth with the top 10%, particularly after 2002. A dramatic shift in the decile-wise patterns of annual growth rates of assets in favour of the top deciles, particularly the topmost, has also been witnessed. The study considers the extent of wealth inequality by sector, state, and social and religious groups as well. It is hypothesised that the rising levels of wealth inequality are deeply linked to the growth strategy being followed, by which the gains from growth have been redistributed among those who were already wealthy.||Ishan Anand,Anjana Thampi

The relevance of public hearings—underlining principles of “democratic participatory governance,” “sustainable development” and “natural justice” for people—can never be undermined. However, this single procedural step is at the centre of so many legal disputes in the Indian courts (Supreme Court and high courts), and the National Green Tribunal had to repeatedly step in and clarify its importance in public policy and the environmental clearance process. This article reviews a series of judicial and quasi-judicial decisions on the question of the public hearing process in India.||M P Ram Mohan,Himanshu Pabreja

Coal India Limited, the monopoly public sector producer, is saddled with the problems of low productivity. Private sector participation in the sector is limited and restricted to captive mining. The aim of this article is to use a tool called “Discourse Network Analysis” and structurally analyse the configuration of debate on privatisation versus nationalisation from 1997 to 2013.||Arpita Asha Khanna

Therefore, we need to analyse it from a new perspective which can explain the caste system by critically looking at assertion of both, the so-called upper castes and Dalits together.||Vivek Kumar

South Korea's moneymaking technology was key to countries like India, Bangladesh, Bhutan, and Pakistan, where "made-in-Korea" banknotes and coins were circulated. Further, South Korea's moneymaking technology was transferred to some countries like Bhutan to produce currency. Such export of currencies and technology transfer from South Korea to South Asia is significant in the sense that possessing and producing unique national currencies is closely linked to state legitimacy and power.||Sojin Shin

The effort is to conceptualise, through a revitalised notion of the "gift," the challenge of a life constituted as much by an inherent sociality as by a transformative radicalism of thought and action. Resituating caste sociality in a lived sense must, therefore, entail moving beyond victimhood and suffering, and encountering actively the spaces of biography and narrative history.||Sasheej Hegde

What would Ambedkar's Gita look like?||Meera Nanda
01-12-2016||special articles||---------||Financial Inclusion in India : A Demand-side Approach||Existing literature on financial inclusion works with indices that use supply-side information on financial services and fail to capture demand-side information. These indices thus have a serious limitation: they might overestimate the extent of financial inclusion due to multiple bank accounts held by the same individual. Using micro-level data available from a pan-India survey, we compute a financial inclusion index for 22 states based on demand-side information. We find evidence of disagreement between the ranking of the states done on the basis of a supply-side information-based index and our demand-side information-based index. Also, exploiting the microstructure of the data, we attempt to identify some determinants of borrowing from formal sources. We find that being male, having a bank account and higher educational qualification are positively correlated with the likelihood of formal borrowing.||Jyoti Prasad Mukhopadhyay

This article hopes to demonstrate that the case of Jains is in fact quite central to the way in which definitions and understandings of minority and majority have come to be interpreted in our polity.||Manisha Sethi

There were protests in Melbourne and Townsville, where Adani announced that he will set up the headquarters of the project. These groups are calling on the Australian government to invest in solar energy rather than coal, while the proponents for the mine say it will create jobs and boost the local economy. The Adani Group is also planning solar projects in Australia with a capacity of 1,500 MW within five years. The coal projects are yet to reach financial closure.||

It examines the nursing labour market to interrogate how the precise nature of the labour performed, structures the perception of the worker of herself as an inferior, performing disreputable, stigmatised labour. Within the grids of gender, class and caste, work and workers mutually constitute each other to define what respectable work is.

While the article by Haque mentions that it is extending the methods used by Sidhwani (2015), it reproduces in identical form the entire structure of the article by Sidhwani.

In a conflict zone like Kashmir, where the state in the guise of counter-insurgency operations violates the human rights of civilians with impunity, civil society is in direct confrontation with the state. This article discusses the evolution of civil society organisations in Kashmir, their role in the history of resistance, and their struggle to defend human rights in a repressive environment, where legal and extralegal methods are employed to co-opt them or intimidate them into silence.||Mudasir Amin

The first focuses on protected areas and relies on the bureaucracy that often misuses its powers against communities that live in close contact with nature. The second focuses on protecting nature to safeguard people's livelihoods and health. The environmental agenda should focus on the reassertion of people's rights over natural resources, and this should be coupled with an action-oriented promotion of nature-friendly cooperative enterprises in sectors like quarrying, and mineral and sand mining.||Madhav Gadgil

At such moments, if there is enlightened leadership on both sides, the military stalemate can provide the opportunity to seize the moment for a peace deal. The credit for seizing the opportune moment in Colombia to reach the peace accord belongs both to Juan Manuel Santos and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia leader Timochenko.

02-11-2016||review of women's studies||---------||Impossible Immobility||In recent years, many activists working to prevent trafficking of women and children have recognised the thin line between protecting women against trafficking and contributing further to their immobilisation, especially in societies where regulation of women's mobility is a key element of patriarchal control. Addressing the ways in which migration and trafficking get entangled, especially in relation to women and children, it is argued that, in this story, a crucial role is played by the nature/degree of intermediation. The problem of trafficking of women is addressed with reference to the history of their work and migration, with a focus on Bengal, from the colonial period to the present day.||Samita Sen
02-11-2016||review of women's studies||---------||Humanitarian Trafficking : Violence of Rescue and (Mis)calculation of Rehabilitation||Why would women "rescued" from the sex trade riot against their rescuers? Sex workers in Hyderabad often experience rescue as a form of humanitarian violence befitting the United Nation's definition of trafficking. Anti-trafficking laws in India reinforce kinship structures that precipitate the need to participate in sex work. Moreover, without restructuring the wider political economy of female labour, rehabilitation efforts fail to address sex workers' economic needs. Those rescued almost inevitably choose to return to sex work. Anti-trafficking programmes do violence to sex workers while failing to offer them adequate alternatives.||Kimberly Walters
02-11-2016||review of women's studies||---------||Criminalising the Trafficked : Blaming the Victim||People-smuggling and trafficking in humans are generally viewed as two distinct offences. In general, smuggling involves delivering persons into the countries they wish to enter illegally and then leaving them to their own devices. Trafficking for sex and/or labour is defined as coercive in international discourses. In reality, the difference is largely semantic. Women smuggled into another country often fall prey to traffickers, and efforts to punish those who perpetrate the evil end up victimising the victims. Trafficking is not only an abuse of human rights, it is also a process that contributes to statelessness; a status that denies citizenship rights to the victims of trafficking and casts them in a permanent state of non-belonging, devoid of rights.||Paula Banerjee

A few crucial aspects that emerge from the study are the voluntary participation of the victims, who trust false promises, in the trafficking rackets; parents and relatives being loath to admit that their children and female relatives have been trafficked because of social stigma and shame; and, that trafficking is about the neglect of girls and women from marginalised tribes and from a region considered important only because of its strategic location.||Ajailiu Niumai

The discourse on rescue and rehabilitation often portrays girls and women as "liberated" from commercial sexual exploitation. An interrogation of the politics of rescue using research was conducted in a shelter home under the Ujjawala scheme.||Barnali Das
02-11-2016||review of women's studies||---------||'Next Time I Will Go to Dubai' : How Rescue and Rehabilitation Fails Women||Cross-border trafficking between India and Bangladesh is an organised economic activity driven by lack of livelihood options, limited natural resources, a number of social causes, and the regular flow of money it ensures for the victims' families. This study is based on interviews with Bangladeshi women "rescued" by the Indian police from brothels and awaiting repatriation. Many of the repatriated women returned to India within a short time; they were either re-trafficked or returned voluntarily, as their material circumstances and options had not changed. In order to address the vicious cycle of trafficking and re-trafficking, it is essential to give up a protectionist view of these women in favour of one that takes into account the choices they make, and focus on prevention.||Baitali Ganguly
03-11-2016||special articles||---------||Constitutional Geographies and Cartographies of Impunity : Human Rights and Adivasis/Tribes in Contemporary India||The right to liberty for Adivasi communities is expressed in terms of territoriality--homelands that could be mobile or fixed, which confer a particular identity on its people, enabling distinct livelihood practices. Relations of land have been at the core of the Adivasi engagement with the law and the Constitution--both in the case of the peasant and non-peasant communities-- engagements that have signalled major victories through taking struggles into courts of law. This paper explores the fields of constitutionalism and human rights with specific reference to tribes/Adivasis in India. In doing this, the attempt has been to trace some connections that emerge from collective engagements with the Constitution and law with respect to Adivasi rights in India. Popular sovereignty has given voice to practices of sustainability, environmental protection, the nurturing of ecological systems, traditional knowledge systems and the indispensable right "to stay put"--to refuse to move.||Kalpana Kannabiran
03-11-2016||special articles||---------||Domestic Labour and Female Labour Force Participation : Adding a Piece to the Puzzle||The declining female labour force participation in India alongside high economic growth is puzzling. Increasing educational enrolment, and higher household incomes have been offered as hypotheses to explain the decline in women's participation in work. Increasing participation in domestic activities has been considered "status production," and as evidence that economic growth has been beneficial. However, these explanations do not fully account for why women from households with lower incomes and fewer assets are leaving the labour market. National Sample Survey Office data on "domestic activities" reveals that a significant proportion of women are working to ensure the daily survival of households. It is argued that the shift of women's labour to domestic activities may in fact be a strategy to cope with the immiserating tendencies of the Indian economy.||Sirisha C Naidu
03-11-2016||special articles||---------||Harmful Speech and the Politics of Hurt Sentiments : Censorship as a Biopolitical Project in India||The forms of censorship in India, which are based on the assumption that the text or film in question hurts the sentiments of some members of society, are analysed. Drawing on Michel Foucault's discussion on the shift from sovereignty to governmentality and the rise of biopolitics, it is argued that the academic critique of censorship has to take its productive aspects more into account. A close examination of two cases of censorship--regarding the short story "Dudh ka Dam" by Premchand and the film Haider by Vishal Bhardwaj-- illustrates the importance of questions of territoriality as well as the significance of dispersed forms of power for the biopolitical project. The politics of hurt sentiments, thus, become discernible as a powerful tool for the production and organisation of discursive, and at times even physical, forms of violence that are aimed at eradicating the roots for potential threats to the alleged unity of the nation and its population. For this, equating criticism, or deviant behaviour, with intentional assaults thus legitimises the restriction of speech by representing it as a necessary act of self-defence.||Philipp Sperner

Inflation of both series slowed considerably during the last two years or so, the moderation in rural areas has been slower than in urban areas. This was partly due to compositional differences accompanied by divergent price movements and partly due to higher marketing costs and trade margins resulting from the prevailing rural–urban divide in terms of infrastructure bottlenecks, inadequate logistics support, etc.||Tulsi Lingareddy

The larger objective is to examine whether SUCBs are able to compete with their peer group and remain viable when subjected to stringent regulatory requirements, in the event of their conversion. The performance of SUCBs as a group is comparable with that of their peer group, that is, old private sector banks, with the exception of non-performing assets. Performance rankings reveal that the smaller SUCBs are better performers than larger ones, calling for a relook at the threshold for conversion. In the event of conversion of SUCBs into commercial banks, some of the converted entities will be as good as some of the existing OPSBs, or may even be a shade better.||Vijay K Khanna,K Ramesha

Weakening loan recovery rates not only forces banks to face the burden of higher provisions and limits their lending capacity, it also diminishes their profitability and solvency. Examining the determinants of recovery of defaulted loans by banks in India, the need for a stronger and effective insolvency regime is felt so as to improve the debtor-creditor relationship and credit environment. The importance of the presence of collateral, the type of collateral used, and a conducive macroeconomic environment towards recovery of bad loans are highlighted. There is a need for strengthening banks' credit appraisal system. Access to alternative resources facilitates loan recovery, highlighting the need for further development of capital market as a source for adequate resources for borrowers.||Rekha Misra,Rajmal,Radheshyam Verma

13-10-2016||special articles||---------||Fiscal Transfers and Urban Policy : Magnitude and Mechanisms of Urban Dependency||Urban fiscal policy in India remains poorly understood compared to many rapidly urbanising countries. Using underutilised data from the 2001 Census Town Directory and state legislative records, this study examines the level of fiscal transfers from states to urban centres across India to assess the factors which influence urban dependency. The study finds that urban centres depend on state grants for more than two-fifths of revenue, yet dependency levels vary greatly by the state. It presents the first national, empirical evidence of the determinants of city-level dependence on state government in India. The study also contributes to the very sparse literature on public finance for infrastructure in small- and medium-sized towns across developing countries.||Gregory Pierce

The consultative framework of the current official drive is problematic being imbedded within the ideas of "minimalist expansionalism" and "tapered inclusionalism."||Vikas Gupta

But with ICANN having no special jurisdictional immunity and subject to the whims of the judicial and legislative branches of the US government as well as many of its executive agencies, the decision seems more symbolic than meaningful.||

They do so at higher rates and at younger ages than many of those in the West. Marriage does not confer any relative protection from suicide risk for young Indian men; this too is a notable contrast with the evidence from developed economies. There are many potential stressors on Indian women which might explain the pattern of suicide risk. Changes in expectations about marriage relationships appear to be one potent factor in explaining the patterns.||Peter Mayer

Yet governments, communities and international agencies repeatedly appear to have been "taken by surprise" when each of these occurs. What needs to be understood is that systems of mitigation and response are at the very foundation of economic development, built into the understanding of disasters.||Reinmar Seidler,Kamaljit S Bawa

29-09-2016||special articles||---------||Oil Price, Exchange Rate and the Indian Macroeconomy||General discussions on the Indian macroeconomy have centred on two things in the recent past: the impact of depreciation of rupee and the effects of falling world oil prices. Using the structural vector autoregressive approach, the dynamic relationship between movements in oil prices and exchange rates with macroeconomic variables like price, output, interest rate and money are investigated. Additionally, a comparative analysis is conducted to show how each of these structural shocks has historically affected price, output and exchange rate. The results show strong link among these variables. Three results have important policy implications: (i) the world price of oil has a great potential to affect India's output, (ii) targeting depreciation of rupee to expand output may not be an effective policy tool for the RBI, and (iii) variation in rupee's value can have medium- to long-term impact on world price of oil.||Taniya Ghosh

However, the efficiency differentials between these two categories of farmers are less significant in the case of basmati paddy. What then is the sustainability of contract farming in basmati paddy, and should contract farming be promoted only for high-value, non-cereal and horticultural crops in agricultural crisis-stricken Punjab?||Nivedita Sharma

22-09-2016||special articles||---------||Forgetting Partition : Constitutional Amnesia and Nationalism||History’s silence resonates in the textual silence of the Indian Constitution on the immense scale of violence and exodus accompanying the partition of the subcontinent, despite the contemporaneity of partition and constitution writing. Clearly discernible on a closer reading of the Constituent Assembly's debates are implicit influences of partition on key constitutional decisions, such as citizenship, political safeguards for religious minorities and provisions creating a strong central tendency in the union. The constitutional memory of partition, as a freak occurrence for which the "outsider" was to be blamed, resembles the understanding of official historiography. Behind these common registers of memory lie powerful nationalist narratives of identity and unity, which indicate a deep and abiding connection between constitutional amnesia and nationalism.||Kanika Gauba

Mumbai's artisanal fishers, especially the Kolis, are intensely subjected to survival and livelihood pressures. Sustaining the livelihoods of the Kolis and preserving coastal ecosystems is crucial for the city's sustainability. An evaluation of the state's role in implementing CRZ rules links the politics around CRZ to larger issues of livelihood and environmental sustainability. Field research in selected sites provides insights for small-scale fishery-based livelihoods and environmental sustainability.||Hemantkumar A Chouhan,D Parthasarathy,Sarmistha Pattanaik

Then, they use new data to argue that urbanisation in parliamentary elections since at least 1980 is associated, other things being equal, with lower turnout within but not across states, and that within states, this negative relationship holds for the smaller towns as well as metropolitan cities since at least 1989.||Kanchan Chandra,Alan Potter

These names do not necessarily conform to strict Islamic norms. Such names, as well as names based on natural objects and phenomena, still remain in vogue, especially in the rural areas.

16-09-2016||special articles||---------||Why Wage Differences Exist across Sectors? : Explanations Based on India’s Industrial Sector||Inter-industry differences in wages are substantial, and over time, they do not seem to be disappearing. Productivity is a determinant of wage differences across industries, though the association between them is not very strong at the aggregate level or for intermediate goods, capital goods, and consumer non-durables. Trade liberalisation enhances productivity and wages at the aggregate level, and also in the case of basic goods and capital goods. However, in an attempt to raise productivity, firms may extract more work from those who are already engaged, and tend to pay them less than their due share in certain industry groups. Contractualisation and feminisation show similar effects for all the industry groups except the intermediate goods industries, and has a worsening effect on wages and also productivity.||Arup Mitra,Prakash Singh

In North East India, the problem arises in the case of those communities which have a rich and vibrant oral tradition, but no written texts. When writers from these communities adopt a literary language which is alien to their culture, they have to understand the historical conditions that enable them to use that language. The literary cultures in this region have witnessed a gradual shrinking of frontiers from the trans-regional vernaculars to a confined and limited regional space, where atomisation of cultures is more visible than development of cosmopolitan vernaculars.||Tilottoma Misra

At the turn of the century, its availability in India was poor and no domestic production existed until the first Council of Scientific and Industrial Research licensee began production in 2001-02. Its price was less than half that of the drug made by a multinational company, the major supplier in the market at that time. Its supply increased to 1,20,000 doses in 2011 after other producers entered the market. Prices dropped by more than 50%. The economic impact of streptokinase technologies, or the value that would be lost if the licensee's streptokinase did not exist, is about `580 crore for the patients.||Manisha G Singh,Nisha Chandran,Zakir Thomas,Dipankar Basu,Samir K Brahmachari

This has happened in Argentina and now in India. These may look like country-specific disputes on genetically modified seed technologies, but there is much more than what meets the eye.||Shalini Bhutani

The lack of political will is clear as the government attempts to push for a heavily diluted legislation in place of the Rajya Sabha-sanctioned long-suffering community.||

Against this reality, Muslim women's groups have been campaigning for codification of personal law.||Qazi Sarah Rasheed,A K Sharma

The politics of hate actually works to build a consensus for ruling class economics. It is not surprising, therefore, that the only "nationalist outlook" of our times is to stand firmly behind the policy programme for the global investor.||Atul Sood

A significant finding was that technological fixes for social protection programmes are only feasible insofar as they work within the political logic of the context in question. CORE PDS reforms could not address the issues of power imbalances between shop owners and cardholders which continue to shape interactions between them. Introducing transparency, accountability and quasi-market reforms in this context offered limited possibilities in what they could achieve.||Anuradha Joshi,Dipa Sinha,Biraj Patnaik

Although the dominance of the army has not diminished, in the last two decades there has been a noticeable deepening of democratisation processes. In the future, if there is another attempt to impose military rule, there could be greater opposition; processes to undermine the military's hegemony are already evident.||S Akbar Zaidi
01-09-2016||commentary||---------||Sharmila and the Forgotten Genealogy of Violence in Manipur||The focus throughout these 16 years has been on the iconised personality of Irom Sharmila, rather than on the reason and the demand of her protest. She has still not given up her demand, which is to repeal the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, but is merely changing her strategy. To misrecognise and misrepresent is also a form of violence, and it perpetrates the already existing militarism. Such misrecognition is what has led to the imposition of the AFSPA in the fi rst place, the culture that looks at the people of the region with suspicion. The AFSPA has produced precisely such a culture of violence and impunity, the hallmark of which is the inability to trust.||Yengkhom Jilangamba

Without strong deterrence, curbing the black economy is difficult.

Her promise of extension of freebies to all sections of society had seduced the voters to elect her, in a trade-off between their self-interest on the one hand, and democratic rights on the other.

31-08-2016||special articles||---------||Lost in Transition : A Narrative of Non-existence||The September 2015 Supreme Court judgment over the festering Chakma refugee issue turned the spotlight on one of the most intractable refugee issues in the history of post-independent India. Much like its first landmark verdict of 1996, this judgment also unequivocally upheld the refugees' right to Indian citizenship. Ironically, while the refugees have not benefited from the 1996 ruling over the last two decades, the verdict itself has come to attain the status of a "case law." This paper cogitates about the futility of a legal-centric approach to addressing an issue, which is deeply embedded in the complexity of state formation in modern South Asia. By unspooling the rather complex narrative of Chakmas' refugeehood and statelessness, it proposes a "solution of solidarity" approach that might help resolve what has until now proved irresolvable.||Deepak K Singh

What emerges is that five of the six best-performing states of 2001 were also the best performers in 2011. Similarly, four of the six worst performers of 2001 were also among the worst performers of 2011. A consequence of such stickiness of rankings at the top and the bottom is growing regional disparity between the more- and less-developed states.||Sudipto Mundle,Samik Chowdhury,Satadru Sikdar

29-09-2016||glimpses from the past||---------||A 2002 article about cancelling the Indus Waters Treaty reads like it was written today : The late Ramaswamy Iyer had argued that abrogating the Treaty defies moral, legal and practical sense||In 2002, after disputes regarding the Tulbul Navigation Project and familiar media hype about whether the Indus water treaty should be cancelled, the late Ramaswamy R Iyer decided that it might “be useful to put the [his] position down in writing”.       Even in 2002, Iyer writes in the past tense, assuming that the idea of cancelling the treaty for punishing Pakistan is past the scope of real discussion and would not benefit India on moral, legal or more importantly, practical grounds.   Since, similar arguments that Iyer dismissed 14 years ago have been now invoked to call for immediate action and revenge against Pakistan,    it is useful to look at Iyer’s argumentation about what a treaty means, whether it is right to abrogate a water treaty as a measure of punishment,    and his assertion that even if we cancel the treaty in the zeal of pronouncing a punishment to Pakistan, the hardship inflicted on Pakistan will be limited and temporary, while the retention of the waters will create trouble for India.||

25-08-2016||special articles||---------||India's 'Poverty of Numbers' : Revisiting Measurement Issues||The number of "poor" derived by applying price adjustment to an old consumption basket, which is largely what official poverty measures have done, are very different from estimates based on actual consumption baskets that have changed over time. For instance, the share of cereals in household expenditure halved between 1993-94 and 2011-12 in rural areas. In the light of this, we ask if all expenditure would be on food, what percentage of the population would be unable to meet the prescribed calorie requirement? Adding a "minimum" level of expenditure on clothing-bedding-footwear, fuel and light, and conveyance to the "derived" sum of food expenditure provides a second counterfactual. Similarly, the cumulative addition of expenditure on other consumer goods and services provides further counterfactual scenarios.||Gaurav Nayyar,Rohini Nayyar
26-08-2016||special articles||---------||Economic Policy Uncertainty and Growth in India||A measure of economic policy uncertainty or EPU for India is constructed to study its impact on the economy. It is found that gross domestic product growth and fixed investment are negatively related to EPU in India. For instance, if the economic uncertainty were to decrease to the level observed in 2005, India's GDP growth would increase by 0.56%, and fixed investment growth would increase by 1.36%. Additionally, a negative correlation between the Bombay Stock Exchange index and EPU in India is observed, suggesting that increases in EPU lower expectations of future growth or increase perceived risk of listed stocks. Lastly, it is found that firm-level capital expenditure rates are lowered when EPU increases.||Sanjai Bhagat,Pulak Ghosh,Srinivasan Rangan

19-08-2016||special articles||---------||Realising Universal Maternity Entitlements : Lessons from Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana||In India, most of the work women do is invisible and unrecognised because it is done outside the boundaries of the formal economy. As a result, the laws pertaining to maternity entitlements reach a very limited number of women. The National Food Security Act, 2013 was the first national-level legislation to recognise the right of all women to maternity entitlements and wage compensation. Since the passage of the act, India has been using an existing conditional cash transfer scheme, the Indira Gandhi Matritva Sahyog Yojana, to implement this entitlement. An examination of the implementation of defined maternity entitlements under the act via a conditional cash transfer, highlights the failure of such a programme to uphold the spirit of the act. Amendments to the act are necessary to ensure that the most vulnerable women are able to realise their right to maternity entitlements, wage compensation, health and nutrition.||Dipa Sinha,Shikha Nehra,Sonal Matharu,Jasmeet Khanuja,Vanita Leah Falcao

12-08-2016||commentary||---------||Karnataka's Changing Fiscal Landscape : Finances after FFC||Analysing the second Karnataka budget since the Fourteenth Finance Commission award, it is noted that, as assured, more fiscal space is made available to the state government. With greater untied funds, the state has budgeted for higher capital expenditure in some key areas--urban development, police, and tribal welfare--even as it failed to build capacity for power generation, and has introduced too many schemes with too little funds allocated to each.||Pranay Kotasthane,Varun K Ramachandra

Every now and then a political party may drop one and trigger a national crisis. This time around it appears that all the three may have been dropped at the same time. National debt, war, austerity, falling wages and regional disparities were issues central to the leave or remain decisions. They were overtaken by one single issue: immigration.||Radha D'Souza

11-08-2016||brexit effect||---------||Spoils of Brexit for India||Following the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union as a result of the recent referendum, Indian big capital is dismayed in anticipation of the contraction of the monolithic EU market. However, the focus must veer from the losses for big business to the gains for the average Indian. The pound's depreciation in the aftermath of Brexit can be helpful in combating domestic inflation in India. To some extent, Brexit is likely to put a brake on capital exodus and on brain drain from India to the UK. It would also mean cheaper and unrestrained arms trade between India and the UK. It makes the EU less weighty as a cohesive politico-economic bloc, thereby reducing its pooled leverage against India.||Abhijit Sarkar
11-08-2016||brexit effect||---------||Can Income Transfers Help Explain Brexit?||Notwithstanding the conventional narratives of the anti-immigrant sentiments holding sway during the referendum for Brexit, an empirical investigation of the possible factors leading to Brexit does not show any signifi cant correlation between the share of migrants from European Union countries and the regions that voted for Brexit. Share of social security transfers in income was most important in determining if a region voted leave. Decreased employment opportunities and increased hardships that necessitate reliance on welfare payments could have fuelled the anti-immigrant and anti-European sentiment.||Rahul Menon

As the sovereign debt crisis unfolded in Europe, neo-liberal economists and politicians offered to solve the problem by cutting back spending. But, advocating cutbacks according to the principles of market democracy created further political and constitutional risks in Europe.||Shamba Dey

The purveyors of Brexit were playing a game of loser's poker, which they have won.

Like 9/11 which witnessed planes crashing into the World Trade Centre in the US, the dropping of bombs on 6 August 1945 on Japan, and even the storming of the Bastille by the French on 14 July 1789, the day the British made this historical decision is a richly symbolic date.||Bharat Wariavwalla
11-08-2016||insight||---------||How Zakir Naik Appropriated Liberalism’s Flaws—and Won||If Islamic televangelist Zakir Naik is symptomatic of religious fundamentalism, we have to pin which part of his rhetoric accounts for it, and how it is different from other secular affirmations of truths. Any attempt to rerun the old narrative of the irrationality of religion, and of Naik’s supporters being blinded by unexamined religious passion, falls flat on its face. Naik’s religion, in fact, is an embarrassingly evolved version of how a rational religion was conceived post-Enlightenment, and his justification of punishment and justice in Islam strikingly mimics the operation of the modern secular world. This is also how he has been able to gain legitimacy amidst an audience which sees itself as modern.||Shireen Azam
11-08-2016||special articles||---------||Living Together Separately : Dalits in an Emergent Collectivity in a Rajasthan Village||This is the story of a village where Dalits have become economically and politically powerful, and are trying to raise their status in the local social hierarchy, but encounter fierce resistance from the upper castes. As a result, social life becomes complex and complicated to the extent that almost the entire institutional framework, which brings order and stability in society, is being questioned and contested with different castes living in a "hostile" social environment. Such an emergent collectivity gives birth to caste and communal conflicts, "honour" killings, and has implications for the functioning of democratic institutions and implementation of development programmes.||Shashi Bhushan Singh
12-08-2016||special articles||---------||Child Malnutrition in Rajasthan : Study of Tribal Migrant Communities||Remote parts of southern Rajasthan such as Udaipur, Dungarpur, Banswara and Rajsamand are characterised by a predominance of tribal groups and a high prevalence of unskilled, male, seasonal outmigration. A study conducted in these parts in 2014 shows high levels of malnutrition among children in this region. It also discusses how socio-economic characteristics translate into severe resource limitations at the household level, primarily in the availability of nutritious food. Mothers are faced by time and energy constraints in providing adequate care to young ones, especially in migrant households. Normalisation of malnutrition in community perception, rooted in the structural deprivations experienced by these communities, further entrenches the problem. The study argues that implementing local solutions and adopting strategic policy reforms can offset these constraints to child nutrition in such tribal areas.||Pavitra Mohan,Kumaril Agarwal,Priyanka Jain

05-08-2016||commentary||---------||Burhan Wani and Beyond : India's Denial, Kashmir's Defiance||The anger of the Kashmiri people in the face of the Indian establishment's endeavour to smother their legitimate political aspirations is understandable. Since 2008, attempts by civilians to organise themselves peacefully against their oppression or even for their day-to-day needs, including water, electricity and jobs, have been met with brute force, even murders. Post 2010, Kashmir has moved in circles from periods of unrest to calm and then back to unrest. Burhan Wani's death was just a small spark that was needed to break the pretence of normalcy thrust on its people. The government should realise that the stone pelters on the streets are neither Pakistanis nor paid agents. Kashmir, today, needs an open-minded political intervention that is unconditional.||Anuradha Bhasin Jamwal

Informed by their ancient knowledge systems, indigenous populations across the world are resisting the plunder of the planet. However, indigenous knowledge systems are in radical conflict not only with global capitalism but with modern education itself, thus raising the issue of radical choice. The issue goes much beyond the classical domain of the pedagogy of the oppressed.||Nirmalangshu Mukherji
03-08-2016||special articles||---------||Olaf Caroe's Fabrication of the 'McMahon Line' :||In the latter half of the 1930s, British officials under the leadership of Olaf Caroe doctored and garbled the records of the 1914 Simla Conference to make them support the assertion that India's north-eastern borderline lay legitimately just where Henry McMahon had tried to unsuccessfully place it. By the end of World War II, Caroe's fabrication had to a large extent been made good--the alignment he named the "McMahon Line" had been established as the de facto British-India north-eastern borderline (falling short only in its leaving Tawang to Tibet). The assertion that this was also the de jure border had apparently solid evidence, documentary and cartographic, to support it. The evidence for its legitimacy was, however, fraudulent, and Caroe's deception was eventually exposed. Yet, Nehru's absolute refusal to negotiate a boundary settlement with China continues to be Indian government policy.||Neville Maxwell

It still is virtually a non-starter and has not addressed any substantive issue. Intra-regional trade is minuscule. India and Pakistan show little interest in the organisation. Without judging their respective foreign policies, it is argued that South Asian regionalism is not on their agenda. Three questions arise: Is South Asia at all a region? How much does the strategic divide between India and Pakistan, with China factored in, come in the way of South Asian regionalism? Why should India bother about regionalism when its policy of bilateralism serves it fine? To probe these, the region's history, global perceptions of the region, India's foreign and educational practices, and interstate relationships are discussed.||Partha S Ghosh

29-07-2016||commentary||---------||Religion and Scheduled Caste Status||The Supreme Court's judgment in the case of Mohammad Sadique carries disturbing implications for Muslim Dhobis, Dooms, Julahas, Mochis, etc, who face social disabilities similar to Hindu Dhobis, Dooms, Julahas, Mochis, etc, but are denied the same legal status. It seems to convey that the former could get the Scheduled Caste status provided they agree to convert to Hinduism, Sikhism or Buddhism. This judgment is in conflict with the basic tenets of the Constitution. There is thus an urgent need to review the relationship of religion and caste as assumed in the acts that deal with the question of the membership of SCs.||Padmanabh Samarendra

Remittances have thus become increasingly important and are a crucial link between source and destination areas. Based on primary data collected in 12 representative villages in seven districts, sources of livelihoods and local income (agriculture, livestock, non-agriculture) are examined vis-à-vis remittances in rural Bihar. Changes in the distribution of income sources over time are studied, disaggregated by household variables such as caste, class and landownership, and individual variables such as gender and education, across income quintiles, giving insights into the role of migration (and remittances) in agrarian change, livelihood diversification and social transformation in rural Bihar.||Amrita Datta

It happened due to what Paul R Brass conceptualised as the institutional riot system, which until the Muzaffarnagar riot was understood to be primarily an urban phenomenon. The growth of the IRS, a post-green revolution phenomenon, that is, since the 1980s in western UP, was on account of the emergence of new classes in the villages, and changes in the nature of rural-urban relations. The Lok Sabha elections of 2014 provided a suitable context for the rural IRS to operate.||Jagpal Singh

This paper looks at the issue of caste and access to these services in the context of the Integrated Child Development Services. It draws evidence from a sample of nearly 5,000 households and more than 200 institutional service delivery points in the mixed-caste villages spread across three states. The findings suggest that the implementation gap coupled with exclusionary biases not only affect the access of lower caste groups to public services but also often intensify their disadvantages.||Gobinda C Pal

The aggregated indicators of banking development conceal the reality of an extremely wide divide in the distribution of banking between the urban and rural areas. This is essentially a reflection of the district-wise divide between Mumbai and the other districts, particularly those from central and eastern Maharashtra or Amravati, Nagpur and Aurangabad divisions, which have been identified in the literature as economically backward districts and have also been associated with a high incidence of agrarian distress in recent times. With a thrust on the policy of financial inclusion since 2005, there has been an increase in the number of bank branches in underbanked districts of the state. However, this increase has not helped in correcting the regional divide in bank credit and hence, most districts other than Mumbai continue to be significantly credit-deprived.||Pallavi Chavan
22-07-2016||special articles||---------||Contextualising Transnationalism : Local Embedment and Global Engagement amongst Gujarati Indians in Cape Town||Scholars following the transnational turn in migration studies have stressed the way in which connections that migrants maintain across nation state boundaries affect their daily lives and subjectivities in the place of settlement. By doing so, the influence of the local context on transnational ties is sometimes overlooked. Based on five months of fieldwork amongst the Gujarati Hindu community of Cape Town, the cases presented in this paper show that local particularities inherently affect global processes. It suggests a reconceptualisation of transnational connections that emphasises the influence of the local and historical context of migration and argues that the regionalised migration trajectories and the manifestation of the history of apartheid in the local context have significantly affected the way in which transnational ties with India are maintained by this community.||Molly Fitzpatrick,Mario Rutten
22-07-2016||special articles||---------||Of Gandhi, Godse and the Missing Files : Nine Hours to Rama (1963)||This paper revisits Indian history when a Hollywood movie, Nine Hours to Rama (1963), claiming to be "a film on Gandhi" turned out to be--much to the Indian government's embarrassment--a biopic on Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse. The film, which had been provided sufficient facilities for its making by the government, triggered off a huge uproar in the public sphere and a subsequent ban on the film. It is argued that a peculiar desecration anxiety and the conjoined traumas of patricide and partition linked to the totemic figure of Gandhi engendered such an outcry in India. Similarly, apart from other political contingencies, the film and the evidence of the government's collusion in its making threatened to undermine the Nehruvian government's sovereignty by questioning the legitimacy of its claim to Gandhi's legacy and ultimately resulted in the files related to the film being untraceable in the government archival vaults.||Ravinder Singh

In an attempt to further the understanding, it is noted that Alavi discounted the role of the internal political economy of Pakistan. The canonical patron-client formulation is scrutinised to reformulate the role of Pakistan as an "estranged client." The attempt is to internalise the interplay of the geostrategic and political-economy interests of the Pakistani military in US-Pakistan relations.||Danish Khan

Since 2008, attempts by civilians to organise themselves peacefully against their oppression or even for their day-to-day needs including water, electricity and jobs have been met with brute force, even murders. Post 2010, Kashmir has moved in circles from periods of unrest - to calm - and then back to unrest. Burhan Wani’s death was just a small spark that was needed to break the pretence of normalcy thrust on its people. The government should realise that the stone pelters on the streets are neither Pakistani nor paid agents. Kashmir, today, needs a political intervention that is unconditional.||

This is erroneous. The state in a "liberalised regime" acts almost exclusively in the interests of globalised capital and the domestic corporate-financial oligarchy that gets integrated with it, which means inter alia a withdrawal of state support from traditional petty production, including peasant agriculture. This is what underlies the phenomenon of absolute impoverishment of the working people, notably in the form of growing nutritional deprivation, which "liberalisation" has unleashed in India over the last 25 years, and which, notwithstanding assiduous denials by its votaries, is quite indubitable.||Prabhat Patnaik

Yet, the truth is that formal employment, especially in the corporate sector, has been stagnant, leading to mounting demands for caste-based reservation for government jobs. India is now, effectively, an outpost of global finance. We have preyed on our own culture and ecology, while the economy we chose to import hides our torn social fabric. Beneath the glitter that our politicians wish to plug is the ugly truth: cultural colonisation is at a historic peak, while we march confidently towards ecocide.||Aseem Shrivastava

Rankings of states in terms of the APMC index show varying time trends: Maharashtra and Punjab witness a stable and high ranking historically. The top gainers in terms of ranking are Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh. The top losers in terms of ranking are Bihar, Gujarat and Odisha. Gujarat and Bihar ranked at 6th and 12th position respectively in 1970 but their ranks deteriorated to 11th and 14th position in 2008. Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Assam show relative improvement in terms of magnitude of the APMC index but continue to rank poorly.

To support research for validation of alternative theories challenging the rational approach, deeply rooted in the general equilibrium theory, we need empirical evidence linking the micro with the macro. The idea is to seek conformance of these theories based on ground realities and to consider institutions and governance as important components of this analysis. The existing statistical system in India needs to be reoriented following the System of National Accounts 2008 on microdata to capture distributional characteristics of macroaggregates. There is a new direction in applied econometrics based on the idea of stochastic equilibrium which is testable using microdata. The paper touches upon this idea citing a single work.||R B Barman

This set of four studies, conducted in Mumbai and Kolkata, brings to the fore the relationship between labour and urban space, the fundamental problematic in the emergence of the neo-liberal city. Though playing a critical role in the neo-liberal restructuring of urban space, the migrants have been targeted by state agencies and sections of civil society, who find it difficult to accommodate them within the physical, social, political and cultural spaces of the city.||Ranabir Samaddar

It starts with interrogating a historical narrative of urbanisation and zoning practices in the city in the 1960s and picks out few threads which still seem relevant in studies of contemporary modes of urbanisation. It studies in some detail the practice of "thika tenancy" in the Kolkata slums--the most prominent site of habitation of the migrant workers in the city. It challenges the hypothesis of the "bypass model" of urbanisation in Kolkata and introduces the concept of "urban recycling," which facilitates a continuous juxtaposition of displacement and accumulation of human and other resources as part of the urbanisation process.||Iman Kumar Mitra

It tries to locate these experiences within the larger processes of the neo-liberal envisioning of Mumbai as a global city, the ever-growing informalisation of labour, and displacement and inadequate resettlement of people, resulting in restricted access to affordable housing, services, workspaces and social welfare. The analyses expose how the homeless migrants perpetually suffer from the condition of suspended citizenship, lead their everyday domestic life under public gaze, face violence and also confront civil society's increasing assertion for rights over public spaces.||Manish K Jha,Pushpendra KUMAR
01-07-2016||migrants and the city||---------||Sleepless in Mumbai : Spotlight on Elderly Security Guards||The anti-migrant political environment in the city of Mumbai has created a confused sociopolitical and economic environment, where the migrant worker, essential to manufacturing and service provision, is able to find work, but is unwelcome in terms of occupying physical, social, political and cultural spaces in the city. The paper attempts to bring this contradiction to the fore through a study of elderly migrant labour employed in the private security provision industry. From the study it becomes apparent that the reality of the lives of workers is shaped by factors beyond work and wages. Their living conditions, inability to cope with any exigency, including illness or death, the atomised lives that they lead in the city in comparison to the villages, and absence of social security or access to quality welfare services force these workers and their families to live in precarious conditions.||Mouleshri Vyas
01-07-2016||special articles||---------||Sustainable Development as Environmental Justice : Exploring Judicial Discourse in India||The principle of sustainable development has evolved to occupy centrality in environmental jurisprudence in India. The Supreme Court has reiterated its importance in the country's environmental legal regime. However, the jurisprudence has been criticised for framing it as a zero sum game where economic development has been repeatedly used as a justification to trump environmental violations, and therefore, rendering it as only declaratory and lacking in content and sufficient teeth to shape public action. But this has compelled policy and statutory recognition of the principle of sustainable development. The National Green Tribunal Act of 2010 recognises it too. This statutory recognition has paved the way for a robust jurisprudence spearheaded by the NGT that has actively sought to evolve a standard of review for public actions in effectuating the principle of sustainable development and in doing so has departed from the reductionist utilitarianism that had characterised the jurisprudence of Supreme Court.||Nupur Chowdhury

Instead, the ability to secure a job away from land, to move out of the village and possibly overseas have come to constitute new markers of status in a traditionally competitive society. The paper departs from common representations of the caste as an upwardly mobile and successful group, and focuses instead on the discontent and on those who try to achieve the new values of the caste, but fail. As a consequence of failure it shows how Patidars recur to what, from an outsider's point of view, may seem paradoxical: in order to "move up" and participate in the culture and economy of the caste, they have to "move down." In this respect, the paper also contributes to understanding the unevenness of India's growth and the contrary trends that work both to strengthen and weaken caste identity.||Alice Tilche
29-06-2016||review of rural affairs||---------||Inequality in Rural Nagaland : Changing Structures and Mechanisms||Tribal villages are usually perceived to be the egalitarian counterparts to villages in India that are ruled by hierarchical caste structures. Taking the case of Ao Naga villages, clan rank and class are found to be important for understanding the changing structures of inequality. Today, these villages are deeply integrated into the larger milieus: politics, administration, education and the market economy. The social mechanisms responsible for inequality are now to a large degree centred outside the village, and living in a village has become almost identical with a lower social status. One result of this process is that instead of clan ranks, the access to outside resources forms the basis of social inequality within the village. Based on secondary sources as well as original fieldwork, an account of how this integration leads to class differentiations at the village level is presented.||Andreas Küchle
29-06-2016||review of rural affairs||---------||Village Restudies : Trials and Tribulations||An account of the inception, management and initial conclusions of a research project which "restudied" three villages, one each in Odisha, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat is presented. These villages had been first studied in the 1950s by British anthropologists F G Bailey, Adrian C Mayer and David F Pocock. The new research was to focus on the sociological conditions of life in these villages today and compare the results of the new surveys with the data from the 1950s. The material presented here also points to some of the strengths, weaknesses and idiosyncratic charms of "restudies."||
29-06-2016||review of rural affairs||---------||Non-farm Diversification, Inequality and Mobility in Palanpur||Data from seven decades of survey in Palanpur provide insights into the changing nature of the village economy. Starting as a predominantly agrarian economy, Palanpur has seen non-farm employment emerge as a major driver of growth and distribution of income in the village economy, but accompanied by increasing inequality. There is evidence of greater mobility among the disadvantaged in Palanpur alongside falling inter-generational mobility. Preliminary analysis suggests that the nature of non-farm activities has become increasingly casual and informal, thereby more accessible to households at the bottom of the distribution, but still significantly influenced by access to networks and family ties, particularly for the more remunerative and stable non-farm jobs.||Himanshu,Bhavna Joshi,Peter Lanjouw

29-06-2016||review of rural affairs||---------||Revisiting the Rural in 21st Century India||The Review of Rural Affairs this time focuses largely on "restudies" of villages that were studied by social anthropologists and economists in the 1950s. The papers are not simply about documenting the unfolding evolutionary process of development, but bring new perspectives of social science understanding to the study of rural society, and also reflect on the enterprise of anthropology and fieldwork. Jamgod in Madhya Pradesh, Sundarana in Gujarat, Bisipara in Odisha, and Palanpur and Khanpur in Uttar Pradesh were restudied, while one paper presents the results of a fresh study of villages in Nagaland.||Surinder S Jodhka
29-06-2016||review of rural affairs||---------||F G Bailey's Bisipara Revisited||F G Bailey, the renowned British social anthropologist, conducted fieldwork in Bisipara in the highlands of Orissa in the 1950s to examine the ways in which the state, democracy and new forms of economy were changing the traditional organisation and apprehension of power and status. At the time, and following the Temple Entry Act, the former untouchables of the village attempted to gain entry to the Shiva temple. On that occasion, and as Bailey recounts, they were unsuccessful. A new fieldwork conducted in 2013 in the same location presents an update of the continuing drama surrounding the Shiva temple, against a backdrop of the changing polity and economy of the village, and as a manifestation of contested postcolonial identity politics.||Tina Otten,Edward Simpson

Agricultural labour households tend to lease in land and become cultivators.||Chitrasen Bhue,R Vijay
15-06-2016||commentary||---------||Vernacular Nations : Westphalia and the Many Lives of States in Asia||Postcolonial Asia offers at least seven types of states and nations. In their somewhat uncritical pursuit of total nationalism, territorial Asian states compete with their archipelagic cousins. The sea gypsy nations--spread across the South China Sea and other East Asian states--reject the monopoly of land as the only inhabitable space, discounting territory as an essential constituent of a nation. Ironically, while history kept them outside the fold of the territorial states, the present attempts to co-opt them. Only by challenging, as the Asian sea gypsies do, land's claim to being the sole inhabitable territory within law, and rethinking the sea as a place of danger can we truly vernacularise our statist imaginations.||Prabhakar Singh

Indeed, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh--two of the earliest adopters of contract teachers--have either reversed or significantly modified their policy of hiring teachers on contract. A study conducted in nine states --Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Mizoram, Odisha, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh--examines how widespread is the practice of hiring contract teachers across states; to what extent does the profile of the average contract teacher differ from that of regular teachers; what have been the challenges faced by states in meeting their enrolment goals using contract teachers from a political-economy perspective; and how sustainable is the practice of hiring contract teachers.||Tara Béteille,Vimala Ramachandran
15-06-2016||special articles||---------||Marginalised as Minority : Tribal Citizens and Border Thinking in India||The behaviour of social groups, when confronted with modernising state power, seems akin to that of marginalised indigenous in postcolonial societies. Such resistance, it is argued, is often backed by an indigenous subjectivity that derives its strength from a knowledge system much different from the one that drives modern nation states. With Sikkim's biodiversity acclaimed as the richest in the country, the state's government has been celebrating the rich traditional knowledge of the three indigenous ethnic communities of Sikkim: the Lepchas, Bhutias and the Limbus. Discourses of Limbu literature and Lepcha traditional knowledge practices pertaining to biodiversity conservation in east Himalayas are analysed here. The paper also dwells on minority groups, whose response to modernising state power is much different from the stated positions of "benevolent recognition" or "pleas for inclusion." In doing so, it explores the possibility of a different modernity in the political position of the Adivasi Indian.||Mollica Dastider

But this is not the first time an attempt has been made to clean the river. River cleaning schemes initiated in 1974, 1985, 1993, 1996 and 2008-09 have been monumental failures. While the Prime Minister's announcement was followed by a lot of rhetoric and initial moves towards the goal were frantic, two years later, there has been little improvement in the state-of-affairs. This article looks at some of the problems that have dogged programmes designed to clean the river and suggests measures to address the pitfalls.||Raghu Dayal

Moreover, while the issues of shelter deprivation of many households and the question of affordability of shelter remain, a new phenomenon of a sharp rise in the number of vacant houses during the last decade has added to the severity of the housing problem. It establishes the manifestation of rising inequality between those in need of housing and those in abundance.||

While the LDF effectively reaped the windfall of several graft cases in which many ministers as well as the personal staff of the chief minister's office were directly or indirectly involved, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA has steadily succeeded in making inroads into the support base of both the fronts, as well as among new voters, though the party won just one seat.||K M Seethi

An examination of the case of Jharkhand points to reasons for this crisis, including the absence of a strong grievance redressal system, weak financial institutions, acute shortage of functionaries and indiscriminate use of technology. However, some initiatives taken by the state government and civil society in the recent past open up new possibilities for improving the programme.||Ankita Aggarwal

Technology, source of finance and plant size are other key determinants. Contrary to the established wisdom on role of communities, it is suggested that, in practice, the reality of capacity constraints among communities, local-level conflicts and elite capture subvert community participation.||Arabinda Mishra,Gopal K Sarangi,Shivani Wadehra

The 1980s and 1990s saw many developing countries open up their economies. Some of these economies continued to lag behind; however, most of them saw rapid growth post liberalisation. To identify the effect of trade on convergence rates, a single difference approach is followed, comparing convergence patterns pre- and post-liberalisation. The convergence measure is estimated between a set of developing countries and their most active trading partners. The results do not reflect any significant change in the rates of convergence for the developing countries pre- and post-liberalisation.||Garima Siwach
27-05-2016||special articles||---------||On Incidence of Diarrhoea among Children in India : Can the Gordian Knot of Complementarities Be Cut?||Drinking water, sanitation and hygiene behaviour, referred to as the WASH variables by the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund, are acknowledged as the three main determinants of diarrhoeal diseases. But the impact of their complementarities on disease incidence remains understudied. This study uses state and household level data to examine the determinants of child diarrhoeal incidence. It introduces indicators of WASH quality and combined presence, both at the household and state levels. It combines them in a novel analysis to understand their roles. In the Indian states, with the worst WASH infrastructure, these variables are strategic substitutes, but as WASH infrastructure improves, they become strategic complements. Thus, resource allocation to lower diarrhoea incidence must take into account the complementary rather than individual presence of these focal variables. Further, the quality of WASH also matters. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, targeting universal sanitation coverage, is unlikely to be effective unless it breaks the Gordian knot of complementarities and WASH quality holding up the burden of childhood diarrhoea.||Arijita Dutta,Gitanjali Hajra,Shyama V Ramani

WTO debated bringing some of these under its ambit in its Singapore ministerial in 1996, only to jettison most of them by 2004. But trade and investment, trade and competition policy, transparency in government procurement, "labour standards" and provisions around state-owned enterprises could make their way to multilateral agreements after the Nairobi meeting, posing serious challenges to developing and least developed countries.||Rashmi Banga

Using plant-level data for 1997-98, the locational choices of 66 manufacturing industries in 21 Indian states are investigated. First, the degree of agglomeration (Ellison-Glaeser index) is calculated in each of these industries to ascertain in which states they are clustered, followed by an econometric investigation of industrial dispersal policy after controlling for different factors that affect agglomeration. The analysis yields that the dispersal policy has not been successful in most specifications. Factors like presence of infrastructure, coastlines, and labour market pooling determine agglomeration. The results also indicate that the nature of the product, high electricity tariff, and per capita energy gap have induced several industries to disperse.||Vinish Kathuria

This agreement was the outcome of a mutual necessity for both governments to regulate the unchecked movement of minority population across the border, which led them into an unlikely--though nonetheless structurally integral--position of compromise and dialogue. In order to grapple with the phenomenon of cross-border movement of minorities, the two governments had to enter into a series of bilateral dialogues about how this could be regulated, and synchronised for both sides.||Pallavi Raghavan
20-05-2016||special articles||---------||Bodies in Search of Freedom : Changing Rural Political Economy and Nepal’s Marginal Migrants||One of the significant transformations in the political economy of rural Nepal is the gradual weakening of traditional forms of attached and caste-based division of labour. Not only has there been a diversification of rural livelihoods from land- and agriculture-based to non-agricultural- and non-land-based sources, there is also a growing and widespread mobility of labour within and outside the country. Research findings show that mobility of labour has not necessarily meant more freedom for poorer migrants, although the idea of freedom appears to be driving much of the out-migration from rural Nepal. For marginal migrants, the circulatory nature of migration does not appear to be as transformative as might have been expected: while life in the destination may well be urban and modern, their identity remains marginal, reflecting their liminal position. Despite known risks and suffering attached to work, a large number of migrants continue to be attracted to work in exploitative working conditions within Nepal or across the border in India.||Jeevan Raj Sharma

On the other hand, the system of constituency reservation does not have any impact on turnout of voters belonging to other groups, including relatively upper-caste voters. This finding suggests that political reservation does not crowd out electoral participation of other groups. These voters, however, tend to vote for the right-wing political party in reserved constituencies, implying a possibility that political reservation might provoke a social cleavage along caste lines in Indian politics.||Yuko Mori,Takashi Kurosaki

There is a need to utilise every tax instrument, including the capital gains tax on securities, to broaden the tax base.

Estimates for revenue potential of the desired capital gains tax regime further substantiate the argument. Revenue loss estimates, on account of Double Tax Avoidance Agreement with respect to capital gains, with low tax jurisdictions like Mauritius and Singapore, are provided to give a comprehensive view with respect to capital gains tax policy in India.||Prashant Prakash,Jaya Kumari Pandey,Abhishek K Chintu
12-05-2016||special articles||---------||Twentieth Century Socialism : A Minority Rule||The 20th century brand of socialism, following the Bolshevik victory as the prototype of socialisms, has nothing to do with socialism as envisaged by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. It can be considered only as one among different varieties of socialism such as guild socialism, anarchist socialism, market socialism, and so on. The Marxian socialism, as a portrait of an alternative society after capital, is based on the "associated mode of production." The fundamental characteristic which separates socialism envisaged by Marx from the prevailing socialism is that Marx's socialism, conceived as an association of free individuals, is a completely de-alienated society with no commodity, no money, no waged/salaried labour, no state, all of which are considered as instruments of exploitation and repression of a class society used to put down the immense majority of the humans. The 20th century socialism is quite aptly recognised as a system of party-state, two avatars. Characteristically, and in total opposition to it, in no discussion of the nature of the society after capital-- that is, socialism--by Marx and Engels we find these two avatars. They disappear along with capital, the last class society.||Paresh Chattopadhyay

This study evaluates the outcome of this well-construction drive through a survey of nearly 1,000 wells in 24 randomly selected gram panchayats. A majority of sanctioned wells (60% with parapet and 70% without) were completed at the time of the survey. Nearly 95% of completed wells are being utilised for irrigation, leading to a near tripling of agricultural income of those in the command area. The real rate of return from these wells in Jharkhand is estimated to be close to 6%, a respectable figure for any economic investment. However, well construction involves some out-of-pocket expenses and this investment is risky: nearly 12% of the wells were abandoned midway.||Anjor Bhaskar,Sunil Gupta,Pankaj Yadav

The political intent of the Federal Reserve--and indeed, the effect--was to shift control over money and credit away from Washington to Wall Street and other financial and business centres. This aim was voiced already in the 1830s by the Whigs in their fight with Andrew Jackson. The broad economic aim was to prevent a recurrence of the monetary deflation that had long held back the US industrial development, at first after Jackson's war on the Second Bank in the 1830s, and again after the civil war as the government forced prices for gold and other commodities back down to their pre-war levels.||Michael Hudson

This historiography shared its predecessor's concern with social and economic processes but departs from the latter in identifying trajectories of transformations in regions, subregions and localities. This article describes some of the landmarks that marked this shift towards regional history and also engages with the seminal works that marked this endeavour.||Bhairabi Prasad Sahu

27-04-2016||review of women's studies||---------||Studying Women and the Women's Movement in India : Methods and Impressions||This paper is an autobiographical account that draws on the author's research over close to six decades on India as a feminist anthropologist interested in agrarian south India. The feminist lens to her includes looking at all of the issues that concern social scientists, workers in the humanities and in the legal and health professions, as well as political activists, making use of methods already developed (by women as well as men) but now including a crucial women's approach. In addition, as opposed to the male approach which has been dominant until fairly recently (despite the pressure early on from B R Ambedkar), a wide range of feminist approaches has come to include, since independence, the effects of caste and class on women's lives. The paper attempts to provide an account of the author's work especially in Kerala and Tamil Nadu and her current engagements with movements for sustainable agriculture.||Joan P Mencher
26-04-2016||review of women's studies||---------||Real Life Methods : Feminist Explorations of Segregation in Delhi||This paper argues that an emancipatory impulse is critical and central to feminist method--one which effectively counters a widespread fetishisation of social science research where little attention is paid to the relationships of production of research findings and conclusions. Just as the women's movement and its political critique has affected discourses that are not specifically about gender or sexual distinctions, the emancipatory impulse of feminist methods can also be deployed in enquiries that are not focused entirely on gendered accounts of social phenomena. The aim of this study is not to essentialise certain methods as "feminist" but rather to suggest that methods used by a researcher who is a feminist, in enquiries into phenomenon that throw up questions of hierarchies other than gender, would not remain uninfluenced by her feminist politics. This claim is bolstered by the author's experiences as a feminist researcher studying the segregation of Muslims in Delhi.||Ghazala Jamil
26-04-2016||review of women's studies||---------||Stories We Tell : Feminism, Science, Methodology||One of the central methodological insights of feminist science studies has been refuting the binary worlds of nature and culture. Over the last three decades, feminist science studies has developed a vibrant epistemological, and methodological apparatus for studying the natural world as a naturecultural world. Bringing together (inter)disciplinary methodologies, philosophies, practices, assumptions, methods and languages of women's studies and the natural sciences, we see the emergence of new modes of knowledge production. This paper explores the epistemological challenges of studying gender in the natural and physical sciences and the methodological tools the field has developed to study the human and non-human, life and non-life.||Banu Subramaniam
26-04-2016||review of women's studies||---------||The Erotics of Risk : Feminism and the Humanities in Flagrante Delicto||This paper invites contemporary Indian feminism to take a leap outside of its faith--via a humanities turn, using sexualities as a tool--to find a path in academic praxis that resists the structures of moral policing and panics consuming our current political climate. Sexualities offer off-roading alternatives to developmental formations of gendered modernity that confine themselves to the tested, the programmatic and the ethical. The humanities as a method, through sexualities, can propel gender studies to an irrational wanton terrain away from the logics of rights, power and punishment via an engagement with praxis, form and situation into sharp materialist-hedonist possibilities of language, pleasure, profanation, the precarious and the tragic.||Brinda Bose
26-04-2016||review of women's studies||---------||Feminist Critical Medical Anthropology Methodologies : Understanding Gender and Healthcare in India||The author is a critical feminist medical anthropologist who has been engaged in ethnographic research on women's health issues in India for the past 25 years. Drawing from her own research experiences, this paper explores the methodologies entailed in research as a feminist critical medical anthropologist: by unpacking core methodological assumptions behind each component of her disciplinary position, introducing methodologies at each level--sociocultural anthropology, medical anthropology, critical medical anthropology, and finally feminist critical medical anthropology. It also examines how she has operationalised the fusion of these methodological approaches in her own research projects. The ways in which the findings from this research have contributed to our understanding of gender and can be useful for improving healthcare for women are also discussed.||Cecilia Van Hollen

A traversal of different kinds of registers--protests and law reform, pedagogy and research, testimony and lawyering--reflects on how publicity, sexual violence and public secrecy constitute a field. We must pay attention to the question of method not just in relation to feminist, sociological or anthropological research, but also to the question of methods in lawyering and law reform.||Pratiksha Baxi
27-04-2016||review of women's studies||---------||Globalisations, Mobility and Agency : Understanding Women’s Lives through Women’s Voices||Feminist researchers integrate macrostructural processes with everyday micropolitics by locating women's lives at the centre of the research process. Data from this research demonstrate that changing attitudes towards women's education, "good" jobs, and productive work lives help women establish a social position from which they use their agency to successfully negotiate when and whom they will marry, continue to work after marriage, voice opinions against dowry, and navigate their position within and outside the household. Without investigating how gender norms have changed over time and what working in globalised workplaces means to women, it would be easy to miss the change in women's lives and repeat the familiar refrain of exploitation of women in the global South.||Bhavani Arabandi
27-04-2016||special articles||---------||Public Provisioning for Social Protection and Its Implications for Food Security : An Analysis||Persistent hunger and pervasive malnutrition are serious problems in the developing world. Recent literature suggests that well-designed public policies towards provisioning of social protection/security and strengthening of support measures to smallholder agriculture appear to be effective in reducing hunger and malnutrition. An investigation of the role of public provisioning on social protection in combating hunger using the recent evidence for 64 countries in the global South makes a strong case for a substantial push in public provisioning in favour of social protection, which, along with other policy measures, could play a vital role in strengthening national food security. Further, low levels of per capita income must not become an excuse for addressing the most basic human needs, as adequate fiscal space can be created even at low levels of income.||Praveen Jha,Nilachala Acharya

29-04-2016||special articles||---------||Vector Control Operations to Deal with Malaria : Case Study of a Tribal Primary Health Centre in Andhra Pradesh||Although India had some successes in controlling malaria from the time of independence, it still faces a substantial socio-economic burden from this disease. This paper presents a case study of a highly endemic primary health centre with an annual parasite incidence of 30.9 in the tribal regions of Andhra Pradesh. It reviews the various operations involved in vector control methods like bed nets, insecticide spraying and anti-larval operations. Based on the data available with the health functionaries and household level surveys, it makes operational suggestions to improve the efficacy of control measures. It finds that the current focus is heavily skewed towards surveillance for malaria-affected patients with inadequate attention for vector control methods of malaria prevention. Ensuring the adoption of vector control methods by the community will yield rich dividends in curtailing the malarial transmission process.||Rajendra Kondepati

While WPI indicates a disinfl ationary situation for 16 months, CPI indicates inflation. Explaining the construction of the two indices, the trends of subgroups of both indices are presented. It is found that the different sample sizes and weightages of commodity groups of both indices and price interventions in the market explains, at least in part, this odd situation of infl ation along with disinfl ation.||Tulsi Lingareddy

Marking out an opinion as dissent paradoxically enables the consolidation of the mainstream consensus.

20-04-2016||review of urban affairs||---------||Greenfield Development as Tabula Rasa : Rescaling, Speculation and Governance on India’s Urban Frontier||Greenfield urban development can be seen as an enduring idiom of politics in India, with state initiative from precolonial times to the present day responsible for establishing iconic capital cities such as Jaipur, Kolkata, or Chandigarh. However, a renewed interest in building new cities, variously labelled "smart," "green" or "integrated," is now accompanied by an increasing tendency to instrumentalise the urban in pursuit of economic growth and a competitive drive to attract global financial flows. Situated at the intersection of several recent literatures from speculative urbanism to theorisations of rescaling and bypass, the papers in this special issue foreground the struggles over land that animate debates about these greenfield sites while looking beyond these concerns to question the urban futures they presage. Synthesising the insights from these papers, this essay flags critical issues for the politics of urban development and sketches pathways for future research.||Loraine Kennedy,Ashima Sood

Mega-projects are emerging as spaces of exception in economic as well as governance terms with far greater involvement of private actors, and constant negotiation of the central and state governments.||Shriya Anand,Neha Sami
19-04-2016||review of urban affairs||---------||Dholera : The Emperor’s New City||A growing rentier economy is driving urbanisation infrastructure projects in India without distributive linkages with industrialisation. This rentier economy brings within its purview various combinations of policy such as speculative land markets, real estate and other urban infrastructure investments by global and domestic investors, private consultants and developers, interests within the state at various levels, and landowners willing and able to benefit from rentiering. It hinges crucially on ownership of land, and hence on deeply unequal geographies of rent. There is a need to distinguish rent-driven urbanisation infrastructure projects from industrialisation and concomitant job-creation. The peasantry emerges as absolute surplus population irrelevant to this geography of rent, except as an obstacle to growth.||Preeti Sampat
19-04-2016||review of urban affairs||---------||Making of Amaravati : A Landscape of Speculation and Intimidation||This paper examines Amaravati, the proposed greenfield capital of the bifurcated Andhra Pradesh state, against the backdrop of the rise of urban mega-projects across Asia, and the tendencies towards land speculation they have unleashed in Indian cities. It offers a critique of the land pooling mechanisms as they have played out on the ground in the affected villages. It argues that voluntary land pooling on such a large scale has been made possible through a coordinated use of coercive tactics and legal measures, including the land ordinance of the Government of India, which was re-promulgated three times and provided a credible fallback in the AP government's dealings with farmers. Land pooling also facilitated a regime of co-option with absentee landowners aligning, on caste lines, with the ruling party.||C Ramachandraiah
19-04-2016||review of urban affairs||---------||Reading into the Politics of Land : Real Estate Markets in the South-west Peri-urban Area of Chennai||The Sriperumbudur-Oragadam region on the south-western periphery of Chennai metropolis is projected as a growth centre and favoured destination for real estate investment. The Tamil Nadu government's intervention to develop the region into a global manufacturing hub accelerated the transformation of agricultural land for urban real estate. The paper examines the micropolitics of land transformation with a specific focus on the role of private developers. It discusses three findings from qualitative research conducted in 13 villages in the region. First, developers are not a unified category. Second, in a nuanced reading of the material politics of land, it suggests that the actors' embeddedness in local political relations influences their role. Third, it exposes the complex responses of landowners to land acquisition and the market process. Through a comprehensive analysis of the practices of different categories of developers and landowners it adds to the speculative urbanism theory. Finally, it argues for a grounded reading of the transformation and the role of various actors in the process.||Bhuvaneswari Raman

This paper contributes to understanding the politics of urban mega-projects by examining the quality of local economic linkages of an information technology park, located in what is popularly referred to as the "IT corridor" in Chennai. Based on a survey of employees in software firms and support services for IT parks along the corridor, the paper maps patterns of employment creation, new consumption and mobility patterns of those employed in the IT parks and implications for the quality of urban development.||M Vijayabaskar,M Suresh Babu
20-04-2016||review of urban affairs||---------||Making Sense of Place in Rajarhat New Town : The Village in the Urban and the Urban in the Village||The West Bengal government's plan to develop the Rajarhat new township on the periphery of Kolkata in the mid-1990s unwittingly produced an urban landscape that contradicts the master plan. The new town is fragmented into a formal network of roads and gated residential high-rise complexes on the one hand, and dense urban villages with traditional housing layouts on the other. Urban villages and gated communities represent a continuum of new urban living which is marked by a constant need to make sense of the changed reality through varied strategies of place-making. These are in response to the multiple ways in which inhabitants of these very distinct settlement types have been unsettled by urbanisation. The particular emphasis of this paper is on the lived life of inhabitants--examining routine activities that go into the material and social construction of place as well as how place influences social interactions, livelihoods and aspirations.||Ratoola Kundu
20-04-2016||review of urban affairs||---------||New Regimes of Private Governance : The Case of Electronics City in Peri-urban Bengaluru||New forms of urban organisation with private modes of governance are being unleashed across India through the creation of special economic zones, industrial townships and smart cities. This paper aims to bring a grounded understanding of the emergence of such spaces by examining the transformation of the governance systems in Electronics City in peri-urban Bengaluru with the constitution of the Electronics City Industrial Township Authority. Even though ELCITA is not a democratically elected body, it is vested with the powers of a municipality, including the power to levy property tax and perform municipal functions. Such an institution could be created because of an exception provided for industrial townships under the 74th constitutional amendment. New urban regimes like ELCITA are created to bypass the social and political realities of Indian cities. Does this represent a new regime of governance that questions some of the basic premises of state authority in a democracy?||Mathew Idiculla
22-04-2016||special articles||---------||Doing More with Less : Developing JAM+ to Reform Public Finance Management in India||The current focus on financial inclusion has opened up solutions to reduce leakages in central and state government schemes. For these solutions to have a sustainable impact, deeper issues in public fund management must be addressed. These issues revolve on three key challenges: "first-mile" problems of transferring central and state funds to local implementation agencies in a timely, efficient and transparent manner; "last-mile" problems of sending benefits to beneficiary or vendor bank accounts without delays; and "beyond-the-last-mile" challenges of ensuring rural beneficiaries have adequate access to remote banking services. This paper reviews these three challenges and proposes a new public finance management system, namely, JAM+. The authors believe that these reforms have the potential to reduce India's fiscal deficit by ₹1 lakh crore.||A Santhosh Mathew,Dwijo Goswami
22-04-2016||special articles||---------||Hate Speech, Hurt Sentiment, and the (Im)Possibility of Free Speech||This paper examines the evolution of hate speech law through chronological developments. Beginning during the Constitutional Assembly debates, it examines how hate speech law has been interpreted by courts and legislative developments in the six decades post independence. Through this exercise, the author argues that the courts have interpreted the law through a pragmatic lens, often eschewing doctrine for practical reasons. If the judiciary's approach to hate speech law has been through the lens of pragmatism, what does this mean for legal reform, and for framing civil society responses to the existing legal framework around hate speech? Is it possible to ensure a more speech expansive framework while working within the limits of existing constitutional jurisprudence? Do we have to move beyond existing jurisprudence to encourage and protect fearless speech?||Siddharth Narrain

Is there an inherent conflict between laws that set out to protect the freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a), and the freedom to trade under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution? The author looks at the relationship of media ownership and media infrastructure, examines how the government has used policies that regulate newspaper infrastructure, and traces some narratives of conflict between the two rights of freedom of speech and expression and the freedom to trade.||Smarika Kumar

Guided by its programme of fiscal consolidation, the government has almost frozen public investment in order to achieve the targeted deficit for 2016-17. While its proclamation to improve ordinary lives is welcome, a rearrangement of deep-rooted structures of public expenditure in India is required to achieve this.||Pulapre Balakrishnan

Finally, in the absence of plan transfers, post 2017–18, the focus should be to develop a framework for non-fi nance commission grants to states which is predictable and certain.||Pinaki Chakraborty,Manish Gupta

This article explores the issues of providing connections, subsidy provisioning and ensuring sustained use of LPG and other modern fuels, so as to displace solid fuels from Indian kitchens. It also highlights the need for planning for increased demand and addressing institutional gaps to ensure that the benefits of modern fuel adoption, especially health benefits, are realised.||Ashwini Dabadge,Ann Josey,Ashok Sreenivas
12-04-2016||perspectives||---------||Dreaming in English : Challenges of Nationhood and Democracy||With the resurgence of nationalism in this age of aggressive globalisation, the call to &ldquodream in English&rdquo is often a demand for conformity with what are declared to be national mainstreams. The demand for unilingualism and conformity is complicated by the idea of &ldquodreaming in English&rdquo as articulated by colonised and subordinated groups in other contexts. What should give us pause, however, is any easy equation of the English language, or Western democracy, with fixed notions of science, rationality, progress and modernity. How might we think through these conundrums and challenges?||Gyanendra Pandey
12-04-2016||special articles||---------||Formula Does Matter||Amid the chaos around the new gross domestic product figures put out by the Central Statistics Office, profound improvements made in another prominent statistical marker--the Consumer Price Index--also compiled by the CSO, went unnoticed. The CPI series was revised to a more recent base year, 2012. This alone probably deserves commendation as base years of other national price indices have grown significantly remote. It is indeed a tectonic shift in estimation procedure and conforms to international best practice concerning CPI. Here we discuss the decision of CSO to replace the arithmetic mean with the geometric mean in the updated CPI indices by going through each of the established approaches to index number theory used to identify the appropriate formulation to calculate basic indices.||Amit Verma
13-04-2016||special articles||---------||Are Trade Unions Relevant in the Indian Banking Sector? :||There are multiple views on the kind of impact trade unions have on organisations and their employees. The existing literature, however, is not critical or well researched. This study examines the effect of trade unions on job security, training and development, discrimination as well as the long-term performance of organisations. It uses multiple units of analysis to absorb select organisational contexts based on broad themes and voices of employee collectives and employees. It shows how unions can play a positive role by ensuring improved corporate governance and service conditions, though these organisations have a tendency towards internal fragmentation, discrimination and a high degree of political intervention.||Bino Paul G D,Pooja Gupta Mahurkar
14-04-2016||special articles||---------||Tracing the Emergence and Consolidation of Hindutva in Assam||While the Bharatiya Janata Party’s political experiment in making inroads into Assam over the past decade has been discussed at length, surprisingly little attention has been devoted towards understanding the contribution of the social and cultural wings of Sangh Parivar in deepening the roots of Hindutva in the state. This analysis becomes important primarily because Assam (like her other north-eastern sister states) does not provide a particularly fertile territory for the growth of Hindutva, an ideology which finds a natural point of entry in the “Hindi heartland” states, with its invocation of Ram Mandir, cow protection or the propagation of Hindi and Sanskrit languages. Given the complexity of the demography of this region that consists of a mélange of races, ethnicities, faiths, customs and cultures, and the multiplicity of issues, it becomes extremely difficult for an ideology riding on religious nationalism to identify common ground that enables it to make a dent in the region. This essay makes an attempt to understand how Hindu nationalism navigated through this difficult terrain to establish itself both institutionally and ideologically at the social and cultural realm in Assam.||Malini Bhattacharjee
15-04-2016||notes||---------||Communal Politics in Assam : Growth of AIUDF since 2016||The formation and continuous electoral success of the Assam United Democratic Front (AUDF, which is now known as the All India United Democratic Front) has made the state a playground of communal politics. Its success has broken down the traditional Muslim vote bank of the Congress Party. As a result, since the 2006 Assam assembly elections, the Congress Party has adopted a soft Hindutva approach to polarise the non-Muslim voters against the AIUDF. However, the Bharatiya Janata Party's open Hindutva line appeared more attractive to non-Muslims of Assam in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.||Monoj Kumar Nath

Her treatment of the data raises serious analytical issues. Keeping the methodological infirmities in view, this response examines the strong conclusions derived by Bakshi and suggests that the same data can have alternate explanations, albeit of a more modest and tentative nature as befits the data itself.||Gautam Pingle

The artificially higher prices of coal have been passed on to electricity consumers across the country. The scam is conservatively estimated by government officials at no less than ₹29,000 crore, a third of which is in the form of higher power tariffs.

A household survey was conducted in 14 districts of Uttar Pradesh to examine contradictory claims about the practice of untouchability by non-Dalit Muslims and Hindus towards Dalit Muslims in Uttar Pradesh. A section of Dalit Muslim respondents report existence of untouchability in dining relations, habitation, social interaction and access to religious places. Surprisingly, a higher proportion of non-Dalit Muslims corroborate these claims.||Prashant K Trivedi,Srinivas Goli,Fahimuddin,Surinder Kumar
06-04-2016||special articles||---------||Corporate Insolvency Resolution in India : Lessons from a Cross-country Comparison||This paper analyses the corporate insolvency resolution procedures of India, the United Kingdom and Singapore within a common framework of well-specified principles. India, at present, lacks a single, comprehensive law that addresses all aspects of insolvency of a firm. It has multiple laws, regulations and adjudication fora, each of which have created opportunities for debtor firms to exploit the arbitrage between these to frustrate recovery efforts of creditors. This adversely affects the resolution process, the time to recovery and the value recovered. The importance of a comprehensive, well-functioning insolvency resolution framework has been documented in the literature. In India, the Bankruptcy Law Reforms Committee was constituted in 2014 with the objective of proposing a comprehensive framework for resolving the insolvency of firms and individuals. This paper undertakes a comparison of the corporate insolvency resolution framework in the UK, Singapore and India, with the underlying motivation to highlight the similarities and differences across the laws, procedures and institutional context of the three countries.||Rajeswari Sengupta,Anjali Sharma
06-04-2016||special articles||---------||The Nadapuram Enigma : A History of Violence and Communalism in North Malabar (1957–2015)||This paper delineates the social history of insidious communal political violence in north Malabar. It focuses on Nadapuram, a rural region in Kerala's Kozhikode District. The complexities of communal proliferation are products of entanglements of caste, conversion, economic mobility and land relationship. Political discourses at the global stage and efforts in building identity-based alliances have a direct bearing on this region. Changing politics of both the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) also has a direct bearing on the social life of the Hindus, while the communitarian politics of Indian Union Muslim League, Islamic doctrinal debates and neo-Salafisation are no less significant in the making of a new Muslim mindscape. These particularities then facilitate in the making of two oppositional and clannish identities in the region.||P K Yasser Arafath

It stresses that atheism is not a belief in the non-existence of God but an inability to believe in the existence of God. Finally, the essay sets out to examine if there can be an atheistic defence of the concept (not existence, which cannot be proved) of God, and concludes by arguing that it is the only kind of defence of God that is rationally possible.||Tabish Khair

A case is made that the issues at the frontiers of monetary macroeconomics--particularly, the nihilistic stance on monetary policy--can be criticised for illogical and empirically meaningless propositions, reflecting Adarkar's acute analysis during what this paper calls his "Years of High Theory" (1934-1941).

Drawing on recent research conducted in Bengaluru, this paper argues that the links between women and social transformation are being obscured by the intensified concern with safety, and suggests that redescribing women's experience may throw up a new set of issues with which feminist scholarship might productively engage.||Tejaswini Niranjana,Nitya Vasudevan

This paper argues that the manufacturing sector, which recorded declining employment elasticity in the organised sector, will not be able to mend the gap between growth and employment. Rather the goal of rejuvenating manufacturing has to be contextualised in a larger strategy of full employment with interventions related to demand structures, technology, size structure of firms, as well as a calibrated engagement with the global market.||Satyaki Roy

Significant differences between states were found in terms of well-being and wealth indices. Overall, women were found to be far behind men in terms of well-being. The well-being of women was found to decline with age and when they were in larger families, unlike men. While upper-caste women were not found to be doing significantly better than Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe women, upper-caste men were better off. And the women in the northern mountainous regions were found to be doing better than women in the Indo-Gangetic plains. However, the well-being of both men and women was found to be significantly related to the wealth they possessed.||Anindita Sengupta
23-03-2016||special articles||---------||'Witch-hunting' in India? : Do We Need Special Laws?||This paper discusses the findings of a socio-legal study on witch-hunting conducted by the Partners for Law in Development in Jharkhand, Bihar and Chhattisgarh. It highlights the results of the study in order to offer a critical perspective on the increasing reliance on special laws to address the problem of witch-hunting. The socio-legal evidence from the states which already have such special laws on witch-hunting shows their inefficacy in dealing with witch-hunting and related forms of violence. Criminalisation of witch-hunting through special laws is an inadequate response to the problem which has much in common with other forms of violence. There is a need to focus on accountability and reform of the agencies that activate the criminal justice system and to plug the vacuum in relation to reparative justice.||Madhu Mehra,Anuja Agrawal

This article reflects on the nature of demand for such research in the South Asian region and contends that though the quantity and quality of evidence and knowledge for policy research is important, it is equally important to assess the factors that affect its demand. Hence, the preferences and requirements of the policymaking community should be taken cognisance of, otherwise the uptake and use of evidence and knowledge in policymaking would be impeded.||Shweta Srinivasan,Samar Verma

A meaningful change within medical education and the public health system, both predictors of healthcare delivery and of national standards of health, seems to be light years away. While the challenge of reforming medical education in India requires a revolution, much of the debate refuses to identify the elephant in the room, that is, the politics of medical education and public health.||K S Jacob

16-03-2016||money, banking and finance 2016||---------||Monetary Policy Dilemmas at the Current Juncture||Monetary policies in advanced economies and emerging markets face quite different challenges at the current juncture. In the advanced countries, current dilemmas derive from the normalisation of unconventional monetary policies. The short-term dilemma is to determine when to start exiting extraordinary policies and selecting appropriate tools, as conventional tools may not be very relevant during this phase. The medium- to long-term challenges relate to the sequencing, pace and mechanics of normalisation. Monetary policy in emerging markets needs to cope with the familiar dilemmas of fiscal dominance, the growth-inflation trade-off and the "impossible trinity." With fiscal parameters in control, and food and commodity prices subdued, the chief dilemma currently confronting emerging markets involves a trade-off between targeting divergent domestic and external cycles. Although they are now better placed to absorb a sudden stop, the impact is likely to be differential, with those with weaker macroeconomic parameters suffering greater pain.||Alok Sheel

It is important, however, not to draw conclusions for banking policy from a snapshot of the most recent period--the totality of the post-reform experience must be taken into account. That larger experience shows that India's public sector-dominated banking system has served the economy well by improving its performance in respect of both efficiency and stability. Looking ahead, changes in governance and management are required, but it is possible to effect these within the framework of public ownership.||T T Ram Mohan
16-03-2016||money, banking and finance 2016||---------||Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium Modelling : A Sisyphean Toil?||In recent years Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium models have come to play an increasing role in central banks, as an aid in the formulation of monetary policy (and increasingly after the global crisis, for maintaining financial stability). DSGE models, it is claimed, are less a-theoretic than other widely used models such as VAR, or dynamic factor models. As the models are "structural," they are supposed to be immune to the Lucas Critique, and thus can be "taken to the data" in a meaningful way. However, a major feature of these models is that their theoretical underpinnings lie in what has now come to be called as the New Consensus Macroeconomics. Using the prototype real business cycle model as an illustration, this paper brings out the econometric structure underpinning such models. A detailed analytical critique is also presented together with some promising leads for future research.||Dilip M Nachane

This consensus depends on three relationships: demand is inversely dependent on the interest rate, inflation is positively related to the output gap and the central bank can control interest rates to achieve an optimum combination of price and output. This paper presents a theoretical critique of this consensus from an "old" Keynesian perspective since Keynes had raised fundamental objections to each of the three relationships .||Rohit Azad

In an endogenous money environment, financial reforms will prove ineffective in stimulating credit supply to large commercial borrowers. They may, however, prove counterproductive by sharpening the credit constraints faced by agricultural and other petty producers in the economy.||Vineet Kohli

Emerging markets are facing capital flight, with large-scale outflows, especially since the second half of 2015, with the trend expected to continue in 2016. India has been less affected than others, but is clearly vulnerable due to the large number of Indian firms that are exposed to external borrowings, a weak rupee, a year or more of declining merchandise exports, falling corporate profitability, and stressed corporate balance sheets.||Parthapratim Pal

In a bid to balance diverse objectives, India, like many other emerging markets, has resorted to active management of various types of capital flows. This paper finds that while the calibrated liberalisation approach resulted in altering the composition of capital flows towards more stable flows, and has helped India to negotiate the "Trilemma," the use of sporadic capital account management measures in the face of surge or stop of capital flows has not been very effective in achieving their objectives of reducing external vulnerability or mitigating macro-prudential risks.||Abhijit Sen Gupta,Rajeswari Sengupta
17-03-2016||money, banking and finance 2016||---------||Procyclical Credit Growth and Bank NPAs in India||Despite recent monetary policy accommodation, bank credit growth continues to decelerate in India, partly due to huge non-performing asset overhangs in banks. This paper explores various issues related to surging NPAs in banks and observes that excessive credit growth in the past is a major reason that has led to current NPAs. Other factors such as contemporary economic conditions, capital adequacy and overall levels of efficiency of the banks have also affected the incidence of NPAs. For promoting financial stability and enhancing monetary policy effectiveness, it is suggested that macro-prudential aspects such as counter-cyclical capital buffer and dynamic provisioning need to be strengthened. There is also a need to explore if corporate governance concerns could be instrumental in adversely impacting the loan book of state-owned banks.||Amaresh Samantaraya

This paper attempts to investigate whether lending patterns of foreign banks in urban regions of Indian states are indicative of such practices. Using credit data on urban regions of 21 states of India for 1999-2011, this paper finds empirical evidence of cream skimming by foreign banks in India.||Mandira Sarma,Anjali Prashad

The multivariate regressions that take on board several household and state-level controls suggest significant disparities in both the access to as well as the use of finance. More specifically, female-headed households are 10% less likely to access formal finance as compared to households that are headed by males. Similar evidence carries over to the use of finance as well. From a policy standpoint, the paper highlights several policy interventions which can serve the cause of greater financial inclusion of women in the country.||Saibal Ghosh,D Vinod

It reports that aggregate trading activity of FIIs dampens market volatility whereas aggregate trading activity of domestic investors exacerbates volatility. Further, the paper finds that positive shocks in aggregate trading activity have a greater impact than negative shocks; this asymmetry is stronger for aggregate domestic trades. Using a proprietary data set, the paper also relates individual stock volatility to tick-by-tick transaction volume, conditional on trader type and transaction type. The intraday results show that trading among FIIs does not increase stock volatility, but when FIIs sell to domestic clients or when domestic clients trade amongst themselves, volatility increases.||V Ravi Anshuman,Rajesh Chakrabarti,K Kiran Kumar

To make a successful journey from passive suppliers of technology to thought leaders on the question of India's development, the Indian Institutes of Technology must respond to the dominant discourse on development and articulate paradigmatic ideas on what development ought to be for India's democratic project.||Mona G Mehta,Raghubir Sharan

In every other social location, there are various forms of segregation, not to speak of explicit hierarchies.

The paper finds that the bicycle programme has performed well in terms of coverage rate and curtailing direct forms of corruption but a large majority of the beneficiaries stated their preference in favour of receiving the benefits in kind instead of cash. It analyses the determinants of beneficiaries' preference for cash versus kind and finds that the demand-side factors and village characteristics (accessibility of markets) play a dominant role in shaping beneficiaries' preferences.||Maitreesh Ghatak,Chinmaya Kumar,Sandip Mitra

They refer to their own roles and offices as "post offices," used simply for doing the bidding of higher authorities and ferrying messages between the top and bottom of the education chain. Using the case of education delivery, this paper attempts to probe an administrator's perspective in resolving the implementation problem at the last mile and is based on detailed primary fieldwork in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh along with some quantitative surveys conducted in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh. It endeavours to trace the "cognitive maps" of administrators by capturing how last mile public servants see themselves and their jobs, and how notions of job performance are internalised and interpreted within the administrative context of elementary education in India.||Yamini Aiyar,Shrayana Bhattacharya

It is unlikely to deliver worthwhile results. The promised funds could be far more effectively deployed if used differently. This article examines the scheme's deficiencies and suggests options that should be explored. It also considers the Model Tenancy Act of April 2015 and the National Urban Rental Housing Policy (Draft) released in October 2015. The article argues that these policy statements are unlikely to lead anywhere, at least in regard to increasing the supply of rental housing to low-income groups.||Shirish B Patel

In this analysis the law has not been taken as an immutable category, but rather as a political instrument that various groups use to assert their identities and political imaginaries. In doing so, these imaginaries invoke unique histories and reference multiple "genealogies of belonging." By highlighting the multiple uses and interpretations of the FRA in Gudalur, this study opens up space for a discussion around some larger concerns implicated within issues of forests, rights and conservation, particularly, the limits of seeing Adivasis as the only authentic traditional forest-dwellers by highlighting the blurred boundaries between various categories--Adivasi and non-Adivasi, forest and non-forest, legality and illegality. It is in these liminal spaces, where boundaries are blurred, this study offers an analysis informed by the analytic of governmentality to argue that local actors exercise agency in either taking on or resisting environmental subjectivities framed by the FRA.||Manasi Karthik,Ajit Menon
01-03-2016||special articles||---------||Employment Elasticity in India and the US, 1977-2011 : A Sectoral Decomposition Analysis||This paper analyses the phenomenon of jobless growth in India and the United States through the lens of employment elasticity. We decompose the level and change of aggregate employment elasticity in terms of sectoral elasticities, relative growth and employment shares. Estimates of these decompositions are presented with employment and output data from relevant sources for both economies. In India, the agricultural sector was the key determinant of both the level and change of aggregate elasticity till the early 2000s. In the US, the service sector is the most important determinant of the level, but manufacturing remains an important driver of changes in aggregate employment elasticity.||Deepankar Basu,Debarshi Das

The familiar themes of caste and development--along with governance, class alignments, the reservations issue, and communal polarisation--were all important, but the mishandling of them by BJP leaders turned them to their rivals' advantage. The BJP campaign suffered from the over-centralisation of power in the hands of Narendra Modi and Amit Shah. A detailed account, based on fieldwork and interviews with those on the ground, explains how BJP lost in Bihar.||James Manor

The new releases are more than just routine updates, and entail methodological changes and incorporate new sources of data, perhaps in response to various critiques. Yet, on comparing the advance estimates released with past such estimates, the CSO's latest growth projections once again turn out to be far too optimistic.||J Dennis Rajakumar,S L Shetty

It requires clean water to lay its eggs; checking it requires meticulous control of water sources inside and around homes, as well as spraying. When even a pampered New Delhi has been unable to achieve this control, there is little ground for optimism that it can happen elsewhere in India. The best scenario is for Zika to serve as a real wake-up call for community-based and community-empowered mosquito control programmes.||Thomas Abraham

So while we know that urban air pollution poses serious health risks to people living in Indian cities, we do not have a consensus on the details regarding the sources of the pollutants. This is mainly because central and local governments have not invested in setting up and funding an adequate number of research groups in academic institutions to conduct detailed studies around the country. Such neglect leads to knee-jerk reactions like the odd-even scheme.||Dinesh Mohan

Using the experiences of the cities that have experimented with similar TDM measures and Census of India's latest data on how urban population travels to work, the article makes the argument for a sustainable mobility strategy for Indian cities which targets retaining the high modal shares of walking, cycling and public transport in Indian cities.||Akshima T Ghate

This paper chronicles one administrative and scholarly experiment recently launched in Cotton College State University in Guwahati, Assam. The first year's results of the ongoing experiment are revealed and the future potential of this kind of research to engage with questions, such as the fairness and effectiveness of examination and evaluation systems, and the correlation of a student's academic performance with prior education and social background, is recorded. The capacity for comparative research and of using research results to meet student needs better, improve the performance of "at risk" students, or enhance the quality of education and of institutions for production of human capital is noted.||Rowena Robinson,Wasim Raja,Hiten Choudhury,Dhruba J Saikia

Individuals whose identifiers match might be termed duplicands. When very many people are to be identified success can be measured by the (low) proportion of duplicands. The Government of India is engaged upon biometrically identifying the entire population of India. An experiment performed at an early stage of the programme has allowed us to estimate the chance of a false positive: and from that to estimate the proportion of duplicands. For the current population of 1.2 billion the expected proportion of duplicands is 1/121, a ratio which is far too high.||Hans Verghese Mathews

There is evidence that fiscal compulsions at the centre bent the structure of the grant away from that envisioned by the TFC, and that its incentive properties were thereby not preserved. Local governments are the nodes at which the sustainable development goals for improved sanitation and public health have to be delivered. This is the level at which public finance attention has to be focused.||Indira Rajaraman,Manish Gupta
26-02-2016||notes||---------||Reversing the Twin Ideals of Right to Education : No Detention and Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation||The Right to Education Act mandates no detention and continuous and comprehensive evaluation at the elementary school stage. These twin provisions aim to address the problems of high dropout rates, inequity, educational load, and lack of democratic educational environments for children. Ever since they were implemented in 2010, the two mandates have been criticised by many stakeholders as neither practicable nor desirable given the realities in India. These claims are not researched and yet, there are moves towards overturning the no-detention provision. Extreme positions for and against the provisions have been taken, without adequate discussion and thinking on implications, especially on schoolgoing children.||Gunjan Sharma

After the spurt of 2004-05--2011-12 when growth accelerated and the variability of production declined, in recent years growth has slowed and volatility has risen. Given weak world economic prospects and looming climate change, the main objectives of agricultural policy should now be to (i) enhance efficiency of production and natural resource use, and (ii) devise appropriate safety nets to cope with risks whether from markets or climate.||Abhijit Sen

For long, restrictive laws were blamed for their failure. But most of the 2,000 farmer producer companies registered under a new amendment to the Companies Act 1956 appear like old wine in a new bottle.

The paper exposes the weak empirical and theoretical basis of these arguments and the prejudices underlying them. It also makes suggestions to reform reservation policies to extend them to private employment and education, and proposes a reparation policy to compensate for the wilful denial of the right to property and education to the former untouchables.||Sukhadeo Thorat,Nitin Tagade,Ajaya K Naik

19-02-2016||notes||---------||Combating Dengue in India : Challenges and Strategies||The limited official data available on dengue in India fails to define its epidemiological profiles. However, it reveals how little has been done in the surveillance of this disease at the level of the states, and gives an idea of the quantum of effort required to fight dengue. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme faces some classic pitfalls in India with its implementation not mandatory in the states. Arguments about the number of cases and hospitalisation, both with wide ranges, persist. Applying integrated action plans at the district level in the states would have helped. Improvement of the system of public health services, strengthening skills of medical personnel, active surveillance components with a well-functioning surveillance system, enhancement or creation of suitable water distribution network and garbage collection are critical components of an integrated plan.||Éric Daudé,Sumit Mazumdar

11-02-2016||commentary||---------||Need a Common Law of Nations?||Troublesome decisions about international interventions are a conspicuous feature of diplomacy. Diplomatic practices have their roots in domestic polities of democracies that rely heavily on the Common Law principle of legitimising change on the basis of incremental accumulation of precedent. There are striking similarities in the manner in which the Common Law has developed in the 800 years since the Magna Carta. Multilateral diplomatic methods build on the legacies of the Magna Carta and that of collective security bequeathed by the Congress of Vienna and Versailles. Common Law contributed to the demolition of monarchial divine right. This process has lessons that are relevant to the current discourse on whether international interventions dilute state sovereignty and transfer it to supranational structures.||Anupam Ray
11-02-2016||perspectives||---------||Reality of US Farm Subsidies : An Analysis of Agricultural Act of 2014||With the formation of the World Trade Organization in 1995, the United States farm subsidies had moved towards income support, reducing spending on price support measures. The explicit reason was that the WTO had held that the latter forms were more market distorting and had thus put limits on their spending. The new Farm Act 2014 has changed the orientation of farm spending in the opposite direction. Pricebased measures are back in focus, and the US seems less concerned about breaching its WTO limits.||Biswajit Dhar,Roshan Kishore
11-02-2016||special articles||---------||Some Puzzles about Firms : Analyses of India’s Informal Manufacturing Sector||Despite the presence of a large number of manufacturing firms in the informal sector in India, we know very little about their characteristics and evolution over time. We present some puzzles about firms in the Indian informal manufacturing sector, using unit-level data from the National Sample Survey Office surveys of unorganised enterprises from 2000-01 to 2010-11. There is clear evidence of a positive relationship between worker wages and firm productivity, indicating the importance of improving firm productivity in the Indian informal sector as a means to improve the living standards of workers. Our analysis also shows that there are social and economic barriers to informal enterprises increasing their productivity, which is a matter of major policy concern. There are also gender-related differences in the productivity of firms. Targeted government programmes are needed to address the issues that socially disadvantaged groups and female entrepreneurs face in the informal manufacturing sector.||Rajesh Raj S N,Kunal Sen
11-02-2016||special articles||---------||Of Rasoi ka Kaam/Bathroom ka Kaam : Perspectives of Women Domestic Workers||Practices of purity and pollution have been a critical area of inquiry in paid domestic work relations in India. This paper revisits the idea of purity and pollution in the space of the home in paid domestic work, but with the intent to turn the gaze around. It shifts the focus by looking at workers as the subjects and examining their responses. It argues that the existing frameworks for looking at the space of home and the practices of purity and pollution are limiting and have to be revisited to develop a dynamic understanding of the everyday reality of domestic work and caste hierarchies at work.||Sonal Sharma
11-02-2016||special articles||---------||Tax Efforts of West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh : Comparison Based on Consumption Expenditure||West Bengal is facing dire fiscal and financial stringency. Bengal is compared to Andhra Pradesh in order to understand its revenue-generating capacity. A new approach that uses National Sample Survey Office data on consumption expenditure is used to decompose the aggregate consumption data of each state to estimate tax collection for each commodity group. It is found that some part of West Bengal's poor tax realisation may be due to unusually low per capita consumption of some commodities that are important for taxation. The discrepancy might be related to a larger informal sector, and thereby, under-reporting of actual consumption, or genuine consumption behaviour reflecting a different intra- and inter-temporal preference structure. This opens up new avenues for future research.||Jayanta Kumar Dwibedi,Sugata Marjit,Koushik Kumar Hati

12-02-2016||web exclusives||---------||Plutocracy, Populism and the 2016 American Election||Even as the plutocracies of the Republican and Democratic Party represent the same kinds of power interests, there are huge policy differences between even the most corporatist Democrats and the most “moderate” Republicans, especially on social issues. The new President, from whichever party, will have to address the power that corporate and financial institutions wield over politics in the United States.||

Atrocities against Dalits have intensified with the rise of Hindutva forces. While the persecution of Dalit scholars in the recent past has gone relatively unnoticed, the spontaneous outburst at Rohith’s death could portend a new movement against the saffron establishment.||Anand Teltumbde
05-02-2016||commentary||---------||Discrimination on Campuses of Higher Learning : A Perspective from Below||We need to understand the many-headed nature of discrimination prevailing on the campuses of higher education in India. This article argues that discrimination, exclusion and humiliation in campuses can be expressed at different levels: in appointments, admission of students, content of curricula of the Social Sciences and Humanities, the way teachers and Dalit students interact, and how upper caste students interact with their Dalit counterparts. The article is based on the narratives of Dalit students and teachers collected purposively from different universities across the country.||Vivek Kumar

05-02-2016||commentary||---------||Har Khet Ko Pani? : Madhya Pradesh’s Irrigation Reform as a Model||The Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana programme should concentrate on two low-hanging fruits. First, it should quickly put to use 20-40 million ha of unutilised irrigation potential created in major, medium and minor irrigation projects. Second, it should provide better quality power rations to farmers during the time of peak irrigation demand. Madhya Pradesh has done precisely this and multiplied the state's irrigated area quickly, at small incremental cost, delivering double-digit agricultural growth.||Tushaar Shah,Gourav Mishra,Pankaj Kela,Pennan Chinnasamy

All the clever tricks to deny refugees their supposed rights have been very much evident in the latest rash of flights to the European Union. While the rulers of the world seem set upon locking up populations in little national prisons, they should be asking themselves: how can the opportunity of new and different citizens be embraced?||

India lags in its approach to the region; it needs a vision and a strategy for LAC it does not have.||Deepak Bhojwani

03-02-2016||perspectives||---------||Antinomies of Nationalism and Rabindranath Tagore||Rabindranath Tagore's best known work, Nationalism (1917), is often mistaken for the sum and substance of his thoughts on nationalism. However, a look at the evolution of his idea over different stages suggests that his thoughts on nationalism cannot be accommodated within the stereotypes of "internationalism" or "anti-nationalism" in which commentators cast him. To focus only on that is a reductionist over-simplification of Tagore's evolving approach to the antinomies of nationalism as he perceived them.||Sabyasachi Bhattacharya

Resolving these paradoxes helps formulate a more incisive understanding of what bottlenecks lie in the way of eliminating poverty in Bihar and opens the way for working out solutions to the problem.||Mihir Shah

The number of emigrants from Kerala according to the KMS 2014 is larger than what was estimated in the 2011 study. Kerala's economy is largely sustained by the emigrants' remittances. This article looks at the impact of migration on Kerala's economy and society.||K C Zachariah,S Irudaya Rajan
05-02-2016||special articles||---------||Shuddhalekhan : Orthography, Community and the Marathi Public Sphere||This paper examines a long-running debate over Marathi shuddhalekhan, or orthography. Efforts to standardise spelling conventions for Marathi words began in the colonial period and continued through the 1950s. In 1962, the new state of Maharashtra authorised a set of rules for public use. Critics of these revised rules persist, keeping the debate perennial in the public sphere. This paper locates these orthographic debates within colonial-era transformations in Marathi print culture and grammar, and examines the idea of the social and the popular within grammar discourse to examine how and why orthography became a persistent, and controversial issue within Marathi language reform. It explores how seemingly trivial questions at first glance of vowel signs and dots gradually emerge as part of larger ones about literacy, historicity, community and the public sphere.||Prachi Deshpande

29-01-2016||commentary||---------||The Third Umpire : Lodha Committee Report on Indian Cricket||The Lodha Committee report has been cataclysmic for the Board of Control for Cricket in India because of the precedent it has set. The highest court in the country has wrenched the BCCI's door off its hinges and from now on, it cannot be fixed in the way the board would want it to be. The report has the power to become the lodestone through which India's substandard sports governance can be reined in. It is also a case study of how a lack of self-regulation can lead to an independent, autonomous sports organisation mismanaging itself to within the reach of the law.||Sharda Ugra

29-01-2016||commentary||---------||Not in Her Name : Women’s Property Ownership in India||There have been insistent calls for collection of sex-disaggregated asset data, particularly with respect to landownership, but the government's data collection efforts leave much to be desired. This article presents national level estimates of men and women's incidence of agricultural landownership for the first time, using the India Human Development Survey, 2011-12. Evidence shows that property in women's name is empowering and can have a transformative effect on their lives and of their families and children.||Rahul Lahoti,Suchitra J Y,Hema Swaminathan
29-01-2016||commentary||---------||Endangering Academic Autonomy||The University Grants Commission is pushing through a proposal for a uniform choice-based credit system. This would transform the entire university architecture of the country and have far-reaching consequences for higher education. Unfortunately, neither has the UGC taken the experiences of Kerala seriously nor has it spent sufficient time taking feedback from the university community. A sterile, regressive uniformity is being pushed without thought to the consequences.||C Padmanabhan

28-01-2016||perspectives||---------||Paltry Vanities of Intolerance||The terms "tolerance" and "intolerance" that dominate our public discourse today are bandied about as if they were self-explanatory. Matters have come to such a pass that intellectuals are accused of subjecting the Prime Minister to a barrage of intolerance since 2002. At this precise moment of our political history it might be worthwhile to revisit the debate on toleration in political theory, and raise once again a core question: why is toleration a political virtue; indeed, why is it an essential asset of a good society?||Neera Chandhoke
28-01-2016||review of urban affairs||---------||Reflecting on the Share Economy and Urbanising Capital :||Three vectors together constitute the new urban phenomenon, the so-called, ideologically labelled, "share economy," which is actually a "sharing the scraps economy." The three vectors are: (i) the hybrid subsumption structure of the labour process, (ii) the primitive accumulation structure of recommoditisation, and (iii) the extension of the workday. These are being sold to a new generation of youth as a kind of a technologically-inspired new space that they need to occupy. But functionally, these three vectors are at the service of capital.||Biju Mathew
28-01-2016||review of urban affairs||---------||The New 'Love' Story of the Taj Mahal : Urban Planning in the Age of Heritage Tourism in Agra||Home to a legacy from history, Agra boasts of a number of historical monuments. This paper focuses on the urban planning implications and socio-spatial consequences of heritage tourism in Agra. Tim Edensor's categorisation of tourist space as "enclavic" or "heterogeneous," Aihwa Ong's zones of exception and the concept of "elite capture" provide the key conceptual frames that inform the study. The paper argues that global heritage tourism has reconfigured everyday life and the spatial geography of Agra, often deepening urban inequalities. The most affected by these new developments are the poor communities living in and around the Taj Mahal for centuries, who find themselves alienated as their world is taken over by the juggernaut of heritage tourism.||Sheela Prasad,Kapil Kumar Gavsker
29-01-2016||review of urban affairs||---------||Public Social Rental Housing in India : Opportunities and Challenges||While it is recognised that diversity in housing tenure options is a key enabler for low-income families to enter and engage with the urban economy, public housing providers and policymakers claim there are several impediments to the provision of subsidised rental housing. What is the nature of these challenges? What will it take to trigger and sustain a rental housing market in Indian cities that is both public and social? Through an analysis of current public policy recommendations and relevant cases of public provision of rental housing, this paper unbundles these challenges, focusing on the management of social rental housing, tax and governance issues, and lastly, fiscal challenges and new opportunities in rental housing.||Swastik Harish
28-01-2016||review of urban affairs||---------||Politics, Information Technology and Informal Infrastructures in Urban Governance :||Information technology is taking on an increasingly important role in Indian urban governance, both in high-level policy announcements and localised innovations. However, the material and political landscape generated by widespread informal arrangements in urban governance is a challenging environment for these kind of reforms. Without adequately conceptualising and accounting for this, "smart" technological improvements will be limited at best. This article illustrates such a necessity by discussing urban water supply in two urban local bodies in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.||Matt Birkinshaw
28-01-2016||review of urban affairs||---------||Urban Voting and Party Choices in Delhi : Matching Electoral Data with Property Category||In most parts of the world there is a direct relation between economic and social well-being and political participation. India, though, is among the exceptions to this tendency. The poor in India vote more than the rich. This paper, using the case of Delhi, shows that neighbourhoods have a significant influence in voting patterns. The rich in poor neighbourhoods vote more than the rich in affluent neighbourhoods and the poor in rich neighbourhoods vote less than the poor in underprivileged neighbourhoods. This paper uses property tax and property categories to arrive at Delhi's wealth parameters and then tries to match them with voting patterns.||Bhanu Joshi,Kanhu Charan Pradhan,Pranav Sidhwani
28-01-2016||special articles||---------||The Quintile Income Statistic, Money-metric Poverty, and Disequalising Growth in India: 1983 to 2011-12||On the record of poverty and growth in India over the last 30 or so years, the general scholarly view seems to be that there have been substantial declines in money-metric poverty and that the growth in per capita consumption expenditure has not been marked by any discernible evidence of non-inclusiveness. It is argued in this paper that inferences of this nature are largely a consequence of the particular approaches to the measurement of poverty and inclusiveness that have been generally adopted in the literature. Alternative, and arguably more plausible, protocols of measurement suggest a picture of money-metric deprivation and growing disparity in India which shares little in common with received wisdom on the subject.||S Subramanian,D Jayaraj
28-01-2016||special articles||---------||Small Farms in a Fertile Tract : Trends in a North Indian Village: 1930s–2012||From late colonial rent reliefs and agricultural researches to the recent land acquisition bill and the "second green revolution," Indian agriculture has seen several transitions. This paper tracks detailed quantitative and qualitative evidence on long-term shifts in agricultural practices, yields and land relations in Dhantala, a village in western Uttar Pradesh, from the 1930s to 2012. This is done with the help of family and kutcherry records, elders' recall and surveys as well as the interviews conducted personally in three revisits since 1989. This study combines anthropological and oral history methods to reconstruct agrarian change. Located in a well-irrigated, fertile tract and having experienced land redistribution prior to economic liberalisation, this village helps in grasping the limits and scope of agricultural growth in a predominantly small and marginal farm structure supported by favourable soil.||Devesh Vijay

It is only in those societies that centralise citizenship have disciplines such as economics, sociology, political science, as well as the humanities, made significant advances. This is because democracies alone robustly satisfy the foundational principles of social sciences, namely, allowing for human errors and the recognition of others in making choices for oneself.||Dipankar Gupta
20-01-2016||special articles||---------||Religion, Caste and Conversion : Membership of a Scheduled Caste and Judicial Deliberations||The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950 and the two amendments of 1956 and 1990 posit a direct correlation between religion and caste. Only a Hindu, Sikh or Buddhist, according to these acts, can be a member of a Scheduled Caste; caste thus is assumed to exist and survive only within the specified religious communities. This assumption has been a source of litigations often involving those Christian converts and their descendants whose membership of a Scheduled Caste was disputed on account of a change in their religion. The Supreme Court had upheld the assumption that the presence of caste was contingent on religion. However, its understanding of the relationship of caste with religion in the subsequent decades witnessed major shifts. The influence of this new understanding was reflected in its recent judgments when it adjudicated on the pleas of those descendants who were trying to recover the membership of castes which their ancestors had seemingly lost following their conversion to Christianity.||Padmanabh Samarendra

It suggests a series of strategies for improving the quality of forests and proposes reforms for strengthening joint forest management. This paper discusses the likely impact of these reforms on current forest use practice. It does so by analysing the various provisions of the mission and how they support or contradict ongoing forest uses. It also explores whether the institutional reforms proposed in the Green India Mission have adequately addressed the current limitations of JFM.||Sumana Datta
21-01-2016||special articles||---------||The Space of Street-side Religiosity : Miniature Shrines in Chennai||There are two competing theorisations of street-side religiosity in India. One is process-centric; the other is event-centric. While the former approach conceptualises artefacts such as street-side shrines as offering resistance to the dominant ideological spaces, the latter seeks to understand the "event" of their construction and demolition within the "multiple modernities" framework. However, both the approaches take an instrumental view of these shrines. This view is reinforced by dualisms such as modernity and religiosity, local and global, space and place. These shrines co-construct and constitute an interconnected, open-ended, autonomous space. This space is shaped by practices and does not exist prior to the identities. Both space and identities are perennially under construction. The autonomy of the space is derived from its contingent nature.||Pushkal Shivam

Allowing all countries, especially developed ones, to do what they feel able to, rather than what is necessary, sets the world on a dangerous and inequitable path to the future.||T Jayaraman,Tejal Kanitkar

Some facets of Modi’s fashioned persona are scrutinised in the article. The internet, particularly the social media, which was expected to revitalise the public sphere to bring about a new civic culture, has instead allowed for the selective return of the “written word” in support of fascist ideology. The cyberspace, along with the mass media, has enabled the coming together of many virtual “participants” to hurl masculinist abuse and silence their opponents.||Santhosh S

14-01-2016||commentary||---------||India's Rare Earths Industry : A Case of Missed Opportunities||The creation of knowledge in the rare earths domain in India is confi ned to a few government-run complexes with no major links to commercial industry. With interaction between the research community and industry non-existent, India's position as a player in the global rare earths ecosystem is bound to be weak. Further, in the absence of a cohesive national strategy for moving the country up the value chain in rare earths into the intermediate and fi nal product space, India continues to be a low-cost raw material supplier to the global rare earths industry.||S Chandrashekar,Lalitha Sundaresan

14-01-2016||special articles||---------||Evolution of Institutions for Climate Policy in India||The growing focus on climate policy in India is not matched by an equivalent level of attention to institutions . Effective institutions are also needed for the design, coordination and implementation of policy. This paper examines the functioning of institutions, organised around three periods: pre-2007; 2007 to 2009 and 2010 to mid-2014. Several key themes emerge: First, the formation of climate institutions has often been ad hoc and is inadequately geared to India's co-benefits based approach to climate policy. Second, there is a lack of continuity in institutions, once established. Third, coordination across government has been uneven and episodic. Fourth, while various efforts at knowledge generation have been attempted, they do not add up to a mechanism for sustained and consistent strategic thinking on climate change. Fifth, the overall capacity within government remains limited. Sixth, capacity shortfalls are exacerbated by closed structures of governance that only partially draw on external expertise.||Navroz K Dubash,Neha B Joseph
14-01-2016||special articles||---------||Imagining Colonial Assam : The Figuring of ‘Wastelands’ in Its Making||The colonial state's categorisation of land as wasteland was not based on an ecological understanding. Such lands were, rather, identified on the basis of productivity. Wastes, therefore, connoted "untapped" "idle"; items to which value had not accrued because they had not been utilised for commercial purposes. This paper observes how value addition to land was central to the thesis on private property and how the idea justified colonial territorial acquisitions and classification of population in Assam. It also led to differentiating people on the basis of their habitat and land-use patterns. The colonial classification of wasteland and the colonial idea of the indigenous Assamese as lazy and indolent lay at the root of the colonial state's encouraging peasant migrations from outside Assam into arable lands in the province.||Sarah Hilaly

They show a steady rise, despite the Domestic Violence Act coming into force in 2005. This paper studies the efficacy of the law enforcement agencies' response in dealing with the rising trend through an econometric panel data study and posits new explanatory societal variables and reports significant correlations between the explanatory variables and agency responses to reported domestic violence crimes. It questions the functioning of police force and calls for a critical analysis of the policy of employing women in police force. It also brings out key insights for a comprehensive policy review and interventions to improve the effectiveness of agencies.||Anubha Shekhar Sinha,Milind Padalkar,Sreevas Sahastranaman
15-01-2016||special articles||---------||Role of Private Sector in Medical Education and Human Resource Development for Health in India||This paper examines the growth and regional spread of medical education in India, particularly in the private sector. An important feature of the considerable growth of medical education, especially after the 1990s, has been the setting up of numerous private medical colleges in the country. Interestingly, this growth has occurred primarily in the more developed states with better health outcomes, while the low-income states with poor health indicators have lagged behind. This unequal distribution of medical colleges has had an impact on the availability of medical services and has resulted in regional differences in access to doctors in the country.||Pradeep Kumar Choudhury
15-01-2016||notes||---------||Wages and Non-wage Benefits in Organised Manufacturing : Evidence since 1981–82||It is conventionally claimed that protected by “pro-worker” labour laws, organised sector workers receive a disproportionate share of the fruits of economic growth. And these “rigid” labour laws are believed to hinder output and employment. An evaluation of wages and earnings data (1981–82—2011–12) suggests that organised sector workers’ real wages have grown slower (0.82% per annum) than per capita income growth (3.6% pa) in India— despite high productivity growth— while their non-wage benefi ts have declined at (-)0.18% pa.||Srijita Chakraborty

The Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission was the first programme to provide substantial funds for urban local bodies to improve their infrastructure and bring in better governance systems. This article tries to look at the mission from a new public management perspective. The performance of ULBs in project implementation shows delinking from the reforms agenda of the mission. The efficiency enhancement goal of the mission has not been achieved completely and uniformly across the ULBs, states and sectors. With the new government planning to invest Rs 7,060 crore in 100 smart cities across the country, the learnings from JNNURM can be instrumental in contributing towards a successful new programme.||Vidhee Kiran Avashia,Amit Garg
06-01-2016||special articles||---------||Determining Growers' Participation in Contract Farming in Punjab :||Small farmers' participation in global value chains is of prime importance for inclusive agricultural development in developing countries like India. However, the issue of inclusiveness of modern arrangements like contract farming and the determinants of participation in such arrangements is understudied in such contexts. This paper examines the issue of small farmers' participation in contract farming arrangements in Punjab, where farming is dominated by medium and relatively large farms. Based on a sample of contract and non-contract farmers, this paper examines the relationship between the farmers' resourcefulness and contract farming participation, selectivity bias, and its impact on farm income. It finds that the contract and the non-contract farmers differ in terms of education, agricultural machinery ownership, and owned and operational landholdings. Small farmers are not, by and large, part of contract farming practice in the studied crops and the selectivity bias exists in contract farming; however, it does not have any significant impact on farm income. Small farmers' participation can be improved through better institutional mechanisms, including group contracts and incentives for contracting agencies to work with small farmers.||Nivedita Sharma
08-01-2016||special articles||---------||Closing the Policy Gap : Building Energy Code Lessons from Andhra Pradesh||Buildings have significant ecological footprint. But they could also be sources of energy savings. This potential of buildings, however, remains untapped. Andhra Pradesh is among the first Indian states to adopt a mandatory building energy policy. This paper analyses the reasons for the state's success. It argues that Andhra Pradesh's success owes to the state identifying the constraints of the sector's underlying institutional and technical arrangements, as opposed to following a top-down policymaking approach. These constraints were addressed during regulatory design through a participatory process involving state and non-state actors. As a result, local solutions have bridged the gap between existing structures and policy goals. In drawing from Andhra Pradesh's example, this paper offers lessons for ways to overcome the gridlock in building energy efficiency and the need to embed policy goals in their broader implementation context.||Radhika Khosla
08-01-2016||notes||---------||Strident Politics and Grey Economics : Debating Net Neutrality||The politics over the neutrality principle revolves around issues of freedom of expression, right to equal access, innovation, and monopoly power exercised by some players in the internet market. Supporting net neutrality has become a matter of political correctness. Even actors who have been found trying to violate neutrality have vowed to protect the principle. Here, three areas in economics of the internet are explored: market structure sustainability of good networks, impact of neutrality on consumer, and investment in network infrastructure. A number of grey areas in economics are found, which show that the neutrality principle may not always be good, or effective, or may even be redundant.||Shobhna Kunwar

If past trends are anything to go by, economic growth in 2015-16 will not improve in the last quarter as some seem to hope. The movements in the GDP defl ators and the very odd behaviour of a gradual decline in the investment rate together indicate that growth in 2015-16 will not end as earlier forecast.||J Dennis Rajakumar,S L Shetty
08-01-2016||discussion||---------||Men Doing Feminism : Epistemic and Political Uncertainties||The 16 May 2015 issue of the EPW has a special section which refreshingly argues that men can be feminists and they can contribute to feminist knowledge when they make "care" an intellectual virtue and "care epistemology" their choicest mode. This affirmation is broached through an autobiographical mapping of each of the author's "towards feminism" journey. But the articles seem to have violated the same "care-epistemic" principles they had set for themselves. This review questions care epistemology's pertinence to the agenda in question. It points out that autobiography, ethnography and care could never accompany each other well.||Arnab Chatterjee
