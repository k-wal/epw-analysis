30-12-2016||special articles||---------||Contours of Access to Water and Sanitation in India : Drawing on the Right to Live with Human Dignity||Improving the access to water and sanitation for all sections of society has been a significant development priority in recent decades in India and the same has been juxtaposed with advocacy for water and sanitation to be recognised as the legal human rights. However, very limited attention has been paid to seeing water and sanitation as a legal right for the populace, despite the debate over the abysmally low indicators of hygienic parameters for the vulnerable sections of society. Whereas Article 21 of the Constitution enunciates Right to Life in its multidimensional manifestations, including the right to safe drinking water, reflections on the findings of the NSS 69th round (which looks at the conditions of drinking water and sanitation in India, among other things) critically examines the availability of the water and conditions of sanitation for Indians. The right to water does not mean mere availability of water but water of standard quality so as to ensure healthy life of an individual. This article attempts to assess the hygienic conditions from the point of view of international benchmarks as also the effectiveness of rights provided under the Constitution and in other statutory documents with regard to water and sanitation.||Pankaj K P Shreyaskar

However, the real issue--of reverting to sustainable cropping patterns and improving water-use efficiency--remains unaddressed. An improvement of 15% to 20% in water-use efficiency from the present level can provide each state with the increased water share it is demanding.||Sucha Singh Gill

Various agreements, accords, tribunals, commissions and water sharing formulas have been worked out time to time, but the problem still remains unsolved. Haryana is stressing for the completion of the Sutlej-Yamuna Link to carry its share of surplus Ravi-Beas water (3.5 million acre-feet) awarded to it in 1976, while Punjab argues that it has no surplus water to share with Haryana, and is adopting various measures to check this outflow of water. Such awards and agreements are generally politically-induced, and therefore, remain unimplemented. This study highlights the ground realities related to irrigation to evaluate the claims and counterclaims of both the states.||H S Mangat

The relevance of public hearings—underlining principles of “democratic participatory governance,” “sustainable development” and “natural justice” for people—can never be undermined. However, this single procedural step is at the centre of so many legal disputes in the Indian courts (Supreme Court and high courts), and the National Green Tribunal had to repeatedly step in and clarify its importance in public policy and the environmental clearance process.

Relations of land have been at the core of the Adivasi engagement with the law and the Constitution--both in the case of the peasant and non-peasant communities-- engagements that have signalled major victories through taking struggles into courts of law. This paper explores the fields of constitutionalism and human rights with specific reference to tribes/Adivasis in India. In doing this, the attempt has been to trace some connections that emerge from collective engagements with the Constitution and law with respect to Adivasi rights in India. Popular sovereignty has given voice to practices of sustainability, environmental protection, the nurturing of ecological systems, traditional knowledge systems and the indispensable right "to stay put"--to refuse to move.||Kalpana Kannabiran

Yet governments, communities and international agencies repeatedly appear to have been "taken by surprise" when each of these occurs.

29-09-2016||glimpses from the past||---------||A 2002 article about cancelling the Indus Waters Treaty reads like it was written today : The late Ramaswamy Iyer had argued that abrogating the Treaty defies moral, legal and practical sense||In 2002, after disputes regarding the Tulbul Navigation Project and familiar media hype about whether the Indus water treaty should be cancelled, the late Ramaswamy R Iyer decided that it might “be useful to put the [his] position down in writing”.       Even in 2002, Iyer writes in the past tense, assuming that the idea of cancelling the treaty for punishing Pakistan is past the scope of real discussion and would not benefit India on moral, legal or more importantly, practical grounds.   Since, similar arguments that Iyer dismissed 14 years ago have been now invoked to call for immediate action and revenge against Pakistan,    it is useful to look at Iyer’s argumentation about what a treaty means, whether it is right to abrogate a water treaty as a measure of punishment,    and his assertion that even if we cancel the treaty in the zeal of pronouncing a punishment to Pakistan, the hardship inflicted on Pakistan will be limited and temporary, while the retention of the waters will create trouble for India.||

Statistics may show record-breaking growth rates since 1991. Yet, the truth is that formal employment, especially in the corporate sector, has been stagnant, leading to mounting demands for caste-based reservation for government jobs. India is now, effectively, an outpost of global finance. We have preyed on our own culture and ecology, while the economy we chose to import hides our torn social fabric. Beneath the glitter that our politicians wish to plug is the ugly truth: cultural colonisation is at a historic peak, while we march confidently towards ecocide.||Aseem Shrivastava

The Supreme Court has reiterated its importance in the country's environmental legal regime. However, the jurisprudence has been criticised for framing it as a zero sum game where economic development has been repeatedly used as a justification to trump environmental violations, and therefore, rendering it as only declaratory and lacking in content and sufficient teeth to shape public action. But this has compelled policy and statutory recognition of the principle of sustainable development. The National Green Tribunal Act of 2010 recognises it too. This statutory recognition has paved the way for a robust jurisprudence spearheaded by the NGT that has actively sought to evolve a standard of review for public actions in effectuating the principle of sustainable development and in doing so has departed from the reductionist utilitarianism that had characterised the jurisprudence of Supreme Court.||Nupur Chowdhury

15-06-2016||special articles||---------||Marginalised as Minority : Tribal Citizens and Border Thinking in India||The behaviour of social groups, when confronted with modernising state power, seems akin to that of marginalised indigenous in postcolonial societies. Such resistance, it is argued, is often backed by an indigenous subjectivity that derives its strength from a knowledge system much different from the one that drives modern nation states. With Sikkim's biodiversity acclaimed as the richest in the country, the state's government has been celebrating the rich traditional knowledge of the three indigenous ethnic communities of Sikkim: the Lepchas, Bhutias and the Limbus. Discourses of Limbu literature and Lepcha traditional knowledge practices pertaining to biodiversity conservation in east Himalayas are analysed here. The paper also dwells on minority groups, whose response to modernising state power is much different from the stated positions of "benevolent recognition" or "pleas for inclusion." In doing so, it explores the possibility of a different modernity in the political position of the Adivasi Indian.||Mollica Dastider

But the impact of their complementarities on disease incidence remains understudied. This study uses state and household level data to examine the determinants of child diarrhoeal incidence. It introduces indicators of WASH quality and combined presence, both at the household and state levels. It combines them in a novel analysis to understand their roles. In the Indian states, with the worst WASH infrastructure, these variables are strategic substitutes, but as WASH infrastructure improves, they become strategic complements. Thus, resource allocation to lower diarrhoea incidence must take into account the complementary rather than individual presence of these focal variables. Further, the quality of WASH also matters. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, targeting universal sanitation coverage, is unlikely to be effective unless it breaks the Gordian knot of complementarities and WASH quality holding up the burden of childhood diarrhoea.||Arijita Dutta,Gitanjali Hajra,Shyama V Ramani

01-03-2016||special articles||---------||Blurred Boundaries : Identity and Rights in the Forested Landscapes of Gudalur, Tamil Nadu||This paper critically analyses the politics of claim-making, vis-à-vis, the Forest Rights Act by illustrating how three distinct political actors in Gudalur, Tamil Nadu, have used the FRA. In this analysis the law has not been taken as an immutable category, but rather as a political instrument that various groups use to assert their identities and political imaginaries. In doing so, these imaginaries invoke unique histories and reference multiple "genealogies of belonging." By highlighting the multiple uses and interpretations of the FRA in Gudalur, this study opens up space for a discussion around some larger concerns implicated within issues of forests, rights and conservation, particularly, the limits of seeing Adivasis as the only authentic traditional forest-dwellers by highlighting the blurred boundaries between various categories--Adivasi and non-Adivasi, forest and non-forest, legality and illegality. It is in these liminal spaces, where boundaries are blurred, this study offers an analysis informed by the analytic of governmentality to argue that local actors exercise agency in either taking on or resisting environmental subjectivities framed by the FRA.||Manasi Karthik,Ajit Menon
26-02-2016||commentary||---------||Zika in an Age of Global Health Emergencies||The only way to check Zika is by controlling breeding sites of the vector, the aedes mosquito close to human habitations. It requires clean water to lay its eggs; checking it requires meticulous control of water sources inside and around homes, as well as spraying. When even a pampered New Delhi has been unable to achieve this control, there is little ground for optimism that it can happen elsewhere in India. The best scenario is for Zika to serve as a real wake-up call for community-based and community-empowered mosquito control programmes.||Thomas Abraham
25-02-2016||congestion, pollution and solutions||---------||Transport and Health : Clearing the Air||There has been much firefighting in Delhi in the name of clean air, but very little effort in understanding the causes of air pollution. So while we know that urban air pollution poses serious health risks to people living in Indian cities, we do not have a consensus on the details regarding the sources of the pollutants. This is mainly because central and local governments have not invested in setting up and funding an adequate number of research groups in academic institutions to conduct detailed studies around the country. Such neglect leads to knee-jerk reactions like the odd-even scheme.||Dinesh Mohan
25-02-2016||congestion, pollution and solutions||---------||Vehicular Pollution Mitigation Policies in Delhi||This article discusses how the perennial focus on policies to mitigate vehicular sources of air pollution in Delhi ignores a significant contribution by sectors other than transport. This works to the detriment of framing sustainable transport policies for the city. Such policies should not be dictated by the sole objective to reduce vehicular air pollution; that should rather be seen as a co-benefi t within the larger gains of accessible and safe transportation system.||Rahul Goel,Pallavi Pant
19-02-2016||indian agriculture today||---------||Some Reflections on Agrarian Prospects||Indian agriculture is once again in a slowdown. After the spurt of 2004-05--2011-12 when growth accelerated and the variability of production declined, in recent years growth has slowed and volatility has risen. Given weak world economic prospects and looming climate change, the main objectives of agricultural policy should now be to (i) enhance efficiency of production and natural resource use, and (ii) devise appropriate safety nets to cope with risks whether from markets or climate.||Abhijit Sen

The problem is not a shortage of water, but the absence of proper mechanisms for its augmentation, conservation, distribution, and efficient use. Water management should be given number one priority in agricultural policy, particularly to prevent drought, minimise the risks due to drought and build a climate-resilient agriculture.||S Mahendra Dev

On a visit back four decades later she finds a different country where the same indomitable spirit that felled the United States has ushered in development that minimises environmental degradation and economic disparities.||Madhu Bhaduri
19-02-2016||notes||---------||Combating Dengue in India : Challenges and Strategies||The limited official data available on dengue in India fails to define its epidemiological profiles. However, it reveals how little has been done in the surveillance of this disease at the level of the states, and gives an idea of the quantum of effort required to fight dengue. The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme faces some classic pitfalls in India with its implementation not mandatory in the states. Arguments about the number of cases and hospitalisation, both with wide ranges, persist. Applying integrated action plans at the district level in the states would have helped. Improvement of the system of public health services, strengthening skills of medical personnel, active surveillance components with a well-functioning surveillance system, enhancement or creation of suitable water distribution network and garbage collection are critical components of an integrated plan.||Éric Daudé,Sumit Mazumdar

It discusses three interlinked cases surrounding Buckingham Canal area and argues that the verdicts in these cases allowed the administration to destroy sophisticated water systems. It also argues that these waterbodies could have mitigated, if not prevented, the November–December 2015 floods in Chennai.||R Seenivasan
11-02-2016||special articles||---------||Of Rasoi ka Kaam/Bathroom ka Kaam : Perspectives of Women Domestic Workers||Practices of purity and pollution have been a critical area of inquiry in paid domestic work relations in India. This paper revisits the idea of purity and pollution in the space of the home in paid domestic work, but with the intent to turn the gaze around. It shifts the focus by looking at workers as the subjects and examining their responses. It argues that the existing frameworks for looking at the space of home and the practices of purity and pollution are limiting and have to be revisited to develop a dynamic understanding of the everyday reality of domestic work and caste hierarchies at work.||Sonal Sharma
11-02-2016||special articles||---------||Coastal Ballads and Conservation Ironic : Understanding Implementation Slippages of the CRZ Law||The gap which is created due to state failure in acting as a custodian of "environmental resources" has placed the judiciary in a powerful position and given it colossal freedom while interpreting the coastal zone regulations. This has weakened the spirit of law and reduced the scope and effectiveness of regular administrative agencies expected to implement the law and conservation requirements. This paper highlights that any wavering in implementing the coastal regulation zone law will make areas in the vicinity of waterbodies vulnerable to disasters.||Amita Singh

28-01-2016||review of urban affairs||---------||Politics, Information Technology and Informal Infrastructures in Urban Governance :||Information technology is taking on an increasingly important role in Indian urban governance, both in high-level policy announcements and localised innovations. However, the material and political landscape generated by widespread informal arrangements in urban governance is a challenging environment for these kind of reforms. Without adequately conceptualising and accounting for this, "smart" technological improvements will be limited at best. This article illustrates such a necessity by discussing urban water supply in two urban local bodies in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad.||Matt Birkinshaw
20-01-2016||special articles||---------||Continuing the Forest Conservation Debate : Rhetoric and Reality of Green India Mission||The National Mission for a Green India proposal, released under the aegis of the National Action Plan on Climate Change, is a significant attempt to integrate the mechanism of ecosystem services in the overall framework of forest conservation in India. It suggests a series of strategies for improving the quality of forests and proposes reforms for strengthening joint forest management. This paper discusses the likely impact of these reforms on current forest use practice. It does so by analysing the various provisions of the mission and how they support or contradict ongoing forest uses. It also explores whether the institutional reforms proposed in the Green India Mission have adequately addressed the current limitations of JFM.||Sumana Datta
14-01-2016||special articles||---------||Evolution of Institutions for Climate Policy in India||The growing focus on climate policy in India is not matched by an equivalent level of attention to institutions . Effective institutions are also needed for the design, coordination and implementation of policy. This paper examines the functioning of institutions, organised around three periods: pre-2007; 2007 to 2009 and 2010 to mid-2014. Several key themes emerge: First, the formation of climate institutions has often been ad hoc and is inadequately geared to India's co-benefits based approach to climate policy. Second, there is a lack of continuity in institutions, once established. Third, coordination across government has been uneven and episodic. Fourth, while various efforts at knowledge generation have been attempted, they do not add up to a mechanism for sustained and consistent strategic thinking on climate change. Fifth, the overall capacity within government remains limited. Sixth, capacity shortfalls are exacerbated by closed structures of governance that only partially draw on external expertise.||Navroz K Dubash,Neha B Joseph
14-01-2016||special articles||---------||Imagining Colonial Assam : The Figuring of ‘Wastelands’ in Its Making||The colonial state's categorisation of land as wasteland was not based on an ecological understanding. Such lands were, rather, identified on the basis of productivity. Wastes, therefore, connoted "untapped" "idle"; items to which value had not accrued because they had not been utilised for commercial purposes. This paper observes how value addition to land was central to the thesis on private property and how the idea justified colonial territorial acquisitions and classification of population in Assam. It also led to differentiating people on the basis of their habitat and land-use patterns. The colonial classification of wasteland and the colonial idea of the indigenous Assamese as lazy and indolent lay at the root of the colonial state's encouraging peasant migrations from outside Assam into arable lands in the province.||Sarah Hilaly

06-01-2016||insight||---------||Climate Change Battle in Paris||To understand the outcome of the Paris talks on climate change, it is important to refl ect on the key clauses of the Paris Agreement and the processes that led to its adoption. This article offers an initial assessment and a discussion of whether the views of the developed or developing countries (or both) prevailed. The developing countries went to Paris with some clear objectives and principles. Though some aspects were diluted, they got their red lines protected but they did not manage to get all their positive demands accepted.||Meenakshi Raman
08-01-2016||special articles||---------||Closing the Policy Gap : Building Energy Code Lessons from Andhra Pradesh||Buildings have significant ecological footprint. But they could also be sources of energy savings. This potential of buildings, however, remains untapped. Andhra Pradesh is among the first Indian states to adopt a mandatory building energy policy. This paper analyses the reasons for the state's success. It argues that Andhra Pradesh's success owes to the state identifying the constraints of the sector's underlying institutional and technical arrangements, as opposed to following a top-down policymaking approach. These constraints were addressed during regulatory design through a participatory process involving state and non-state actors. As a result, local solutions have bridged the gap between existing structures and policy goals. In drawing from Andhra Pradesh's example, this paper offers lessons for ways to overcome the gridlock in building energy efficiency and the need to embed policy goals in their broader implementation context.||Radhika Khosla
