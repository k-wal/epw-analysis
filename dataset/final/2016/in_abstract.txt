This article argues that these governance reforms, though essential, are not enough to enable the paradigm shift necessary for sustainability and ecological justice. But it may be a great place to begin.||Rajeswari S Raina
09-12-2016||special articles||---------||Public Hearings in Environmental Clearance Process : Review of Judicial Intervention||A public hearing is the only medium in the environmental clearance process through which people can interact directly with government officials and the project proponents regarding project-related concerns. The relevance of public hearings—underlining principles of “democratic participatory governance,” “sustainable development” and “natural justice” for people—can never be undermined. However, this single procedural step is at the centre of so many legal disputes in the Indian courts (Supreme Court and high courts), and the National Green Tribunal had to repeatedly step in and clarify its importance in public policy and the environmental clearance process. This article reviews a series of judicial and quasi-judicial decisions on the question of the public hearing process in India.||M P Ram Mohan,Himanshu Pabreja

There were protests in Melbourne and Townsville, where Adani announced that he will set up the headquarters of the project. These groups are calling on the Australian government to invest in solar energy rather than coal, while the proponents for the mine say it will create jobs and boost the local economy. The Adani Group is also planning solar projects in Australia with a capacity of 1,500 MW within five years. The coal projects are yet to reach financial closure.||
10-11-2016||notes||---------||Today's Environmentalism : Time for Constructive Cooperative Action||Environmental activism in India comprises two streams. The first focuses on protected areas and relies on the bureaucracy that often misuses its powers against communities that live in close contact with nature. The second focuses on protecting nature to safeguard people's livelihoods and health. The environmental agenda should focus on the reassertion of people's rights over natural resources, and this should be coupled with an action-oriented promotion of nature-friendly cooperative enterprises in sectors like quarrying, and mineral and sand mining.||Madhav Gadgil
03-11-2016||commentary||---------||The Unmaking of the Forest Rights Act||Aimed at protecting the rights of forest dwelling tribal communities the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 promised much. However, over the years its implementation has been tardy and there have been concerted efforts to dilute it. In early October, conservation organisations and ecological scientists wrote to the government about this aspect.||Meena Menon

Expensive mega projects with large reservoirs such as the Ken-Betwa link take decades to plan, design, and implement, and cause enormous environmental damage.||Brij Gopal,Dinesh K Marothia
03-11-2016||special articles||---------||Constitutional Geographies and Cartographies of Impunity : Human Rights and Adivasis/Tribes in Contemporary India||The right to liberty for Adivasi communities is expressed in terms of territoriality--homelands that could be mobile or fixed, which confer a particular identity on its people, enabling distinct livelihood practices. Relations of land have been at the core of the Adivasi engagement with the law and the Constitution--both in the case of the peasant and non-peasant communities-- engagements that have signalled major victories through taking struggles into courts of law. This paper explores the fields of constitutionalism and human rights with specific reference to tribes/Adivasis in India. In doing this, the attempt has been to trace some connections that emerge from collective engagements with the Constitution and law with respect to Adivasi rights in India. Popular sovereignty has given voice to practices of sustainability, environmental protection, the nurturing of ecological systems, traditional knowledge systems and the indispensable right "to stay put"--to refuse to move.||Kalpana Kannabiran
22-09-2016||special articles||---------||Coastal Ecology and Fishing Community in Mumbai : CRZ Policy, Sustainability and Livelihoods||A critique of the Coastal Regulation Zone rules studies their implementation, and violations in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which has experienced massive growth due to rapid economic transformation and urbanisation, resulting in degradation of and damage to sensitive coastal ecologies. Mumbai's artisanal fishers, especially the Kolis, are intensely subjected to survival and livelihood pressures. Sustaining the livelihoods of the Kolis and preserving coastal ecosystems is crucial for the city's sustainability. An evaluation of the state's role in implementing CRZ rules links the politics around CRZ to larger issues of livelihood and environmental sustainability. Field research in selected sites provides insights for small-scale fishery-based livelihoods and environmental sustainability.||Hemantkumar A Chouhan,D Parthasarathy,Sarmistha Pattanaik

This article argues that it would be the repetition of the old historical mistake to approach the issue without taking into consideration the hydrological and ecological aspects. Picking up only those tanks which have water generated in their catchments would save a lot of precious money.||M Dinesh Kumar,Nitin Bassi,K Sivarama Kishan,Shourjomoy Chattopadhyay,Arijit Ganguly

This article attempts to evaluate the current status of firm level environmental information available with the regulators and suggests some measures to streamline, standardise, and strengthen the current regulatory system to enable better compliance by firms.||Shivananda Shetty,Surender Kumar
15-07-2016||25 years of economic liberalisation||---------||A-Meri-India : A Note from the Land of Frustrated Aspirants||Indian economy and society are facing a tumultuous start to the 21st century. Statistics may show record-breaking growth rates since 1991. Yet, the truth is that formal employment, especially in the corporate sector, has been stagnant, leading to mounting demands for caste-based reservation for government jobs. India is now, effectively, an outpost of global finance. We have preyed on our own culture and ecology, while the economy we chose to import hides our torn social fabric. Beneath the glitter that our politicians wish to plug is the ugly truth: cultural colonisation is at a historic peak, while we march confidently towards ecocide.||Aseem Shrivastava

01-07-2016||special articles||---------||Sustainable Development as Environmental Justice : Exploring Judicial Discourse in India||The principle of sustainable development has evolved to occupy centrality in environmental jurisprudence in India. The Supreme Court has reiterated its importance in the country's environmental legal regime. However, the jurisprudence has been criticised for framing it as a zero sum game where economic development has been repeatedly used as a justification to trump environmental violations, and therefore, rendering it as only declaratory and lacking in content and sufficient teeth to shape public action. But this has compelled policy and statutory recognition of the principle of sustainable development. The National Green Tribunal Act of 2010 recognises it too. This statutory recognition has paved the way for a robust jurisprudence spearheaded by the NGT that has actively sought to evolve a standard of review for public actions in effectuating the principle of sustainable development and in doing so has departed from the reductionist utilitarianism that had characterised the jurisprudence of Supreme Court.||Nupur Chowdhury

Engagement with the issue by nuclear abolitionists is called for, lest the impression of a consensus develops around the realist offering of "unacceptable damage" that promises nothing but genocide, a global environmental disaster and national suicide in its wake.||Ali Ahmed

05-05-2016||commentary||---------||A Half-baked Attempt at Revamping Environmental Law||The Environment Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2015 is a major policy attempt to make structural changes in environmental governance. But the bill fails in bringing any change to the institutional mechanism for enforcement of the law. Moreover, the bill attempts to introduce a monetary penalty for environmental damages, which is not in consonance with the well-established polluter pays principle.||Deva Prasad M
07-04-2016||commentary||---------||New Institutional Structure for Water Security in India||There has been no significant change in the knowledge-base and institutional structure for managing water systems since colonial rule. This makes the recent efforts of the Ministry of Water Resources for restructuring the Central Water Commission and the Central Ground Water Board significant. This article argues that the effort should be backed by interdisciplinary studies that see surface water and groundwater as ecologically connected.||Jayanta Bandyopadhyay
18-03-2016||commentary||---------||Menstrual Management and Low-cost Sanitary Napkins||The provision of low-cost sanitary napkins to women in rural areas is not an answer to the myriad problems they face in menstrual management. Apart from the need for a mechanism for ensuring the quality of the products and reducing the environmental cost of non-reusable products, the need is for a change in the attitude towards menstruation. It is because this is a taboo topic ruled by religio-cultural conventions that rural women face not only discomfort but also problems linked to reproductive health.||Nivedita Pathak,Jalandhar Pradhan
10-03-2016||notes||---------||The Environment Caught in Combat||This note traces environmentalism enmeshed in the Cold War politics of the 1970s and discusses its growing relevance in India. Moving away from military strategies and elite political leadership, it examines the environmental movements that had taken off, not only in the Western world, but significantly, in the many colonies of the Empire. The disruption of the relationship between local societies and the natural environment is also critiqued in the context of the expansion of the modern Indian state; arguably one of the foremost legacies of colonialism.||Urvi Desai
01-03-2016||special articles||---------||Blurred Boundaries : Identity and Rights in the Forested Landscapes of Gudalur, Tamil Nadu||This paper critically analyses the politics of claim-making, vis-à-vis, the Forest Rights Act by illustrating how three distinct political actors in Gudalur, Tamil Nadu, have used the FRA. In this analysis the law has not been taken as an immutable category, but rather as a political instrument that various groups use to assert their identities and political imaginaries. In doing so, these imaginaries invoke unique histories and reference multiple "genealogies of belonging." By highlighting the multiple uses and interpretations of the FRA in Gudalur, this study opens up space for a discussion around some larger concerns implicated within issues of forests, rights and conservation, particularly, the limits of seeing Adivasis as the only authentic traditional forest-dwellers by highlighting the blurred boundaries between various categories--Adivasi and non-Adivasi, forest and non-forest, legality and illegality. It is in these liminal spaces, where boundaries are blurred, this study offers an analysis informed by the analytic of governmentality to argue that local actors exercise agency in either taking on or resisting environmental subjectivities framed by the FRA.||Manasi Karthik,Ajit Menon

On a visit back four decades later she finds a different country where the same indomitable spirit that felled the United States has ushered in development that minimises environmental degradation and economic disparities.||Madhu Bhaduri
11-02-2016||special articles||---------||Coastal Ballads and Conservation Ironic : Understanding Implementation Slippages of the CRZ Law||The gap which is created due to state failure in acting as a custodian of "environmental resources" has placed the judiciary in a powerful position and given it colossal freedom while interpreting the coastal zone regulations. This has weakened the spirit of law and reduced the scope and effectiveness of regular administrative agencies expected to implement the law and conservation requirements. This paper highlights that any wavering in implementing the coastal regulation zone law will make areas in the vicinity of waterbodies vulnerable to disasters.||Amita Singh
14-01-2016||special articles||---------||Imagining Colonial Assam : The Figuring of ‘Wastelands’ in Its Making||The colonial state's categorisation of land as wasteland was not based on an ecological understanding. Such lands were, rather, identified on the basis of productivity. Wastes, therefore, connoted "untapped" "idle"; items to which value had not accrued because they had not been utilised for commercial purposes. This paper observes how value addition to land was central to the thesis on private property and how the idea justified colonial territorial acquisitions and classification of population in Assam. It also led to differentiating people on the basis of their habitat and land-use patterns. The colonial classification of wasteland and the colonial idea of the indigenous Assamese as lazy and indolent lay at the root of the colonial state's encouraging peasant migrations from outside Assam into arable lands in the province.||Sarah Hilaly
08-01-2016||special articles||---------||Closing the Policy Gap : Building Energy Code Lessons from Andhra Pradesh||Buildings have significant ecological footprint. But they could also be sources of energy savings. This potential of buildings, however, remains untapped. Andhra Pradesh is among the first Indian states to adopt a mandatory building energy policy. This paper analyses the reasons for the state's success. It argues that Andhra Pradesh's success owes to the state identifying the constraints of the sector's underlying institutional and technical arrangements, as opposed to following a top-down policymaking approach. These constraints were addressed during regulatory design through a participatory process involving state and non-state actors. As a result, local solutions have bridged the gap between existing structures and policy goals. In drawing from Andhra Pradesh's example, this paper offers lessons for ways to overcome the gridlock in building energy efficiency and the need to embed policy goals in their broader implementation context.||Radhika Khosla
