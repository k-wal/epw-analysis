However, the demonstrations reflect a deep divide in Thai society according to class, region and ideology, a divide which has developed over the past half century as growth has centred on Bangkok while the rural north and east have been left behind.

Examining this question, this paper makes an attempt to decompose changes in the domestic prices of select agricultural commodities by using a decomposition model. This allows separating the factors responsible for changes in domestic prices and quantifying their effects. The key variables in the model are trade prices, the exchange rate, and agricultural trade policies.

This paper points out that they range from the very large number of beneficiaries to volatile fertiliser prices, necessitating market price indexation of cash transfers and controlling the market power of dealers, especially in remote areas. The imbalance in the use of different fertilisers is also a growing problem. If designed properly, a DCT should be accompanied by significant investment in soil testing and the payment should be tied to balanced use of fertilisers, including micronutrients.

These crops possess high nutritive and fodder value and are primarily consumed by their producers. On the supply side, there has been a large shift in the area under cultivation to rice and wheat and other commercial crops. On the demand side, the distribution of rice and wheat at subsidised prices through the public distribution system has led to a fall in the consumption of sorghum and millets. The decline in cultivated area could result in a problem for the livestock sector in many regions. It is crucial that the sorghum and millet sector be supported by strong government policies and programmes for food, fodder, and better nutrition through value addition and demand creation.

Major attractions of the MGNREGA work include local availability through the year, it being perceived as relatively "easy" work with fixed, regular, gender equal wages, and free from caste-based relations of subordination and discrimination. The gendered impacts of MGNREGA are partly due to the universal, right-based and women-friendly nature of the policy, and partly to the specific ways in which this policy is implemented in Tamil Nadu, where it has received significant cross-party political support.

Agricultural and livelihood vulnerability indices developed showed reduction in vulnerability due to implementation of works under the Act and resulting environmental benefits.

In order to bring transparency and to make medicines more affordable while providing industry with enough incentives, we need to know the manufacturer's selling price and add-on costs as the medicine moves along the supply chain till it reaches the consumer. The findings of this paper indicate that the patient does not benefit from trade schemes, marketing strategies, or the free pharmaceutical market. Brand loyalty and marketing strategies do not allow "real" competition. The paper makes a number of recommendations to make medicines affordable to the common citizen.

The CDP was, however, funded by the Ford Foundation of the United States. This study argues that the major agenda behind the sentimental approach towards India by the Ford Foundation and the US was little more than an attempt to resist the spread of communism in Asia, and India was considered a major strategic location in south Asia. This paper discusses why Ford Foundation funded the CDP and village studies, and what benefits they got from it.

It looks at the various elements that constitute the organisation of economic life of Pardhis in this enclave. It also reflects on the social embeddedness of the Pardhi's economic life by analysing the relationship of their economic life with sociocultural institutions of the community, particularly the kinship system. There are tendencies of forced adaptation to the plurality of forces unleashed by the urban setting or urbanism that has not resulted into significant changes in their traditional institutions and practices. Structures and normative orientations of the traditional order still persist among them and on many occasions get reinforced due to the interplay of different urban situations.

A mass movement that has revolution as its ultimate goal will, almost inevitably, necessarily assume a violent form in the face of state repression. But cruelty and brutality must never be a part of the means of revolution. We educators need to be educated, and our best education can take place only in struggle, for correct knowledge is also a struggle, and can be a deep one at that.

In a country where hunting is illegal, it is not the final elimination of the animal, but the process of hunting which is a method of territorialising the animal and human audiences. As seen in two recent incidents of hunting man-eating leopards in north India, this process invokes anachronistic hunting imagery. Elimination of problem animals should be done without fuss and spectacle, so that larger wildlife conservation aims are not obfuscated.

It not only espouses values that go against normative constructs of Indianness but also questions cinematic conventions.

Vol. 48, No. 51 (DECEMBER 21, 2013)||special article||The Nature of Economic Development and the Economic Development of Nature||PARTHA DASGUPTA||This paper reviews and in part extends an emerging literature that integrates development and environmental thinking. It focuses on a small part of the literature: economic evaluation, and goes on to develop the notion of sustainable development and construct a unified language for sustainability and policy analyses. It is shown that by economic growth we should mean growth in wealth - which is the social worth of an economy's entire set of capital assets - not growth in gross domestic product nor the many ad hoc indicators of human development that have been proposed in recent years. The concept of wealth invites us to extend the notion of capital assets and the idea of investment well beyond conventional usage. The author also shows that by sustainable development we should mean development in which wealth (per head) adjusted for its distribution does not decline. This has radical implications for the way national accounts are prepared and interpreted. The author then provides an account of a recent publication that has put the theory to work by studying the composition of wealth accumulation in contemporary India. The study reveals that the entire architecture of contemporary development thinking is stacked against nature. These are still early days in the measurement of the wealth of nations, but both theory and the few empirical studies we now have at our disposal should substantially alter the way we interpret the progress and regress of nations.

This paper argues that contrary to conventional knowledge, UP has a substantial population of tribes who were "excluded" from constitutional and administrative category of scheduled tribes and wrongly placed in the "lower/lowest categories" of the Hindu social hierarchy. From a zero population of the scheduled tribes until 1970 to a population of one lakh in 2001 to an estimated 26 lakh plus in the 2011 Census is a bizarre story of tribal "annihilation" and upsurge in the state that warrants revisiting tribal issues.

For that, agriculture will have to grow at least 4% annually to support gross domestic product growth rates in excess of 8% if we are to constrain imports at slightly higher levels than at present. Such agricultural growth can be attained with a total factor productivity growth rate of 2%, along with developing the net irrigated area to 90 million hectares. But in the past two decades, agricultural growth has been less than 3% and productivity growth has been lower than 2%. Surface irrigation has not grown and groundwater is being overexploited in many parts of the country. Achieving the required agricultural growth for double-digit growth of the economy is a significant challenge.

In fact, it is often seen as a subset of or engulfed within secularism, which has been central to academic and political debates about democracy, nationalism and contemporary politics. In this special issue, we focus on both in their mutual interaction. It provides a mix of theoretically informed pieces with detailed, contextualised research adding granularity to the discussions by asking: Can secularisation happen without secularism? Or vice versa? What kinds of secularisation have specific versions of secularism promoted? Have there been reversals in secularisation, or has it been a largely linear process in south Asia?

Vol. 48, No. 50 (DECEMBER 14, 2013)||revisiting secularisation||Defining Self and Other: Bangladesh's Secular Aspirations and Its Writing of Islam||SAMIA HUQ||Bangladesh's experience with secularism has been chequered. Beginning with a strong constitutional mandate and political rhetoric, the word "secularism" has been changed, removed and restored, while Islam remains the state religion. Aspirations to the principles of secularism â€“ tolerance, peaceful coexistence, and equal treatment of all religions by the State â€“ have been battled at the level of constitutional amendments and political affiliations. These aspirations also undergird a certain epistemic ground, framed by hermeneutic approaches, which produces particular ways of understanding the self as Muslim and its non-Muslim others. This article examines that epistemic ground, tracing the changes in constructions of the self and the other brought about by the manner in which the Islamic Foundation has approached the Quran, methods for reading it, and the manner in which it has advocated attachment to the Islamic tradition. The article highlights how an increasingly muted understanding of power has led to an ever expansive gap between Muslims and the non-Muslim others they share the nation state of Bangladesh with.

The public visibility of Islam has been analysed through multiple and overlapping lines of scholarly inquiry, which draw attention to the poverty of the "secularisation theory" â€“ the thesis that modernisation leads to a decline of religion in individual minds and social institutions. The case of Pakistan, analysed in this article, is particularly suggestive for highlighting one historical modality of the relationship between religion and politics. Through focusing on concrete instances of exclusion of religious minorities across time, this article proposes the conceptual usefulness of desecularisation as a historically contingent, instituted process for analysing how distinct notions of politics, citizenship and national identity have become embedded in Pakistan. It argues that desecularisation has led to the slow exit of religious minorities from organised political life, an increase in the cultural power of religious parties in dictating the religious content of state policies, and the entrenchment of both politics of expediency and politics of fear in the way state authorities respond to physical and symbolic violence against religious minorities.

The monument is also privy to two kinds of publics â€“ a congregation that offers prayers at the mosque, paying no attention to the central building, and a "public", which stays at the central building and seems to follow the given official meanings of the Taj as a world heritage site. Is it possible to look at the Taj merely as a secular historical monument? If yes, how can we respond to the religious meanings embedded in the very architectural composition of the buildings? Are Muslims, as a religious minority, entitled to use spaces such as the mosque in the Taj Mahal to offer congregational prayers? This article explores these questions to understand the practice and politics of "secularism" in postcolonial India.
Vol. 48, No. 50 (DECEMBER 14, 2013)||revisiting secularisation||Reimagining Secularism: Respect, Domination and Principled Distance||RAJEEV BHARGAVA||It is widely recognised that political secularism, virtually everywhere in the world, is in crisis. It is also acknowledged that to overcome this crisis, secularism needs to be reimagined and reconceptualised. This article takes the first few steps towards doing so. It argues, first, that we need to move away from the standard church-state models of secularism and begin to focus instead on secularism as a response to deep religious diversity. Second, it claims that diversity must be understood as enmeshed in power relations, and therefore the hidden potential of religion-related domination must be explicitly acknowledged. Third, these two moves enable us to view secularism as a response to two forms of institutionalised religious domination, inter-and intra-religious. This way of conceiving secularism rebukes the charge that secularism is intrinsically anti-religious. Secularism is not against religion; it opposes institutionalised religious domination. Finally, the article argues that this conception entails that a secular state shows critical respect to all religious and philosophical world views, possible only when it adopts a policy of principled distance towards all of them.

This article focuses on the latest period in the development of the idea of secularity in India, from the 1990s onwards, while providing some context from the previous ones. A key argument is that modernity and tradition are not doctrinal positions, but alphabetic "languages", through the elements of which quite dissimilar doctrinal positions can be fashioned.
Vol. 48, No. 50 (DECEMBER 14, 2013)||revisiting secularisation||Secularism and Secularisation: A Bibliographical Essay||MOHITA BHATIA||Tracing the trajectory of "secularism" studies, this essay brings out a critique of the evolutionary perspective that pronounced a waning of the "religious" in a predominantly "secular" "modern" world. In the face of global and local realities that negate any strict boundaries between the "secular", "religious" and "political", many western and non-western debates on secularism have creatively re-envisaged the concept and highlighted its variegated meanings. Yet, these have been unable to locate secularism in lived phenomenological realities. This bibliographical essay discusses works that may not be categorised as "secularism" studies and yet offer insights into the interaction between religious, cultural, political and secular aspects of society, while attempting to unentangle the different, but related, processes of "secularism" and "secularisation". It is the secularisation process that needs academic attention to understand the complex interaction between the "secular" and the "religious".

Yet, his central philosophical concern was how to bring about democracy in a society so riven by caste hierarchy and communal division. His detailed consideration of the case for Pakistan was seen by many at the time as contradicting the goals of Indian nationalism. However, his support for Pakistan fits within his philosophy of democracy. This paper presents a close reading of Ambedkar's positions on nationalism, Pakistan, and the protection of minorities. While he saw Pakistan as a logical extension of a demand for protection against the "tyranny of the majority", it considers why he believed Muslims were not simply one among many of India's minorities.
Vol. 48, No. 50 (DECEMBER 14, 2013)||special article||Intermediary Liability in India||PRITIKA RAI ADVANI||In its attempt to regulate content on the internet the Indian state is increasingly making demands on intermediaries to monitor and screen content. This will lead to private, invisible censorship, thereby severely endangering the exercise of our right to freedom of speech and expression. India, like most jurisdictions recognising the role of intermediaries in providing platforms of free speech, has incorporated a safe harbour provision in order to limit their liability. But legislative ambiguities, coupled with the onerous obligations imposed on intermediaries, threaten to defeat the purpose of providing safe harbour protection. Further, a recent spate of judicial decisions that endorse overbroad filtering without taking into account its chilling effects on free speech, highlights a need for immediate changes in the legislative and judicial approach towards intermediary liability in India.

In the case of honour killings, the right to have and, more importantly, access legitimate fundamental and legal rights is under severe doubt. A universal standard framework â€“ such as a reading of "right to have rights" would have it â€“ justifies the very purpose of human rights itself. The origin of human rights, thus, shifts from the matter of "being human" to a matter of social, political and legal constructivism.

The male gender role generates violence by castigating men if they are not violent, and rewarding them with honour when they are. The existence of laws which criminalise men's sexual assault on women have not deterred male violence because it has become merely another ground on which men can prove their masculinity.

Are children from less well-off sections also able to rise to higher paying positions, or are these positions going mainly to established elites? This survey of more than 1,500 recent entrants to a variety of engineering colleges, business schools, and higher civil services finds that class and caste continue to make an important difference. Factors that stand out as significant barriers to entry include rural upbringing and parents' lack of education. Individuals who have succeeded in surmounting these obstacles have almost invariably been assisted by a teacher, relative, or friend who motivated and inspired them. A way out of the conundrum can be explored by investing in role models and information provision.
Vol. 48, No. 49 (DECEMBER 7, 2013)||special article||Child Health in West Bengal: Comparison with Other Regions in India||PUSHKAR MAITRA and RANJAN RAY||There are few areas where the statistics are as dismal as child health in India. This paper analyses four interrelated child health indicators in West Bengal â€” child malnourishment (measured by the rates of stunting and wasting), prenatal, infant, and child mortality rates. It also provides evidence on how these rates vary with the gender of the child, parental education, and the wealth status of households. West Bengal does not fare badly on child health in relation to the all-India figures and does better than the rest of east India, but lags behind south India. Its performance on mortality rates is much better than India as a whole, and, quite significantly, compares favourably with those in south India. However, effective policy interventions are required to delink maternal health from child health and the importance of this cannot be overstated.

Some reports claim that Hyderabad contributes a mind-boggling 74% of the state's total revenues.

This article compares various provisions of the bill with a 2011 draft as well as a bill introduced in the Maharashtra legislature in 2012. It also provides a brief overview of the regulatory mechanisms in different countries for governing the real estate industry. It finds that the bill has serious deficiencies and will do little to help either customers or builders. It will only add one more layer of bureaucracy to an already tedious real estate development process.

Land use planning has not enabled the lower-income groups to live closer to work, road use is more dominated by private vehicles, and there is little money to improve facilities for pedestrians and bicyclists. This paper notes that though much of the basic data on urban transport in India is unreliable, there is enough to show that the challenge is to keep the share of non-personal transport at 70% as incomes increase in our cities. For this, walking and bicycling have to be made safer and public transport more attractive by making it readily available.

Urban transport finds mention in its chapters on sustainable development, environment, and urban development, which focus not only on aspects of public transport, but also urban planning and governance. Identifying the three main themes that emerge from the Plan's recommendations, this paper takes a critical look at them. It comments on what appears to be a significant divergence from the policy recommendations in the Plan and the Plan outlays, both in the first phase of the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission and what is proposed in the second phase, before going on to make specific recommendations on how matters could be improved.

This paper shows that while catering to latent transport demand, Janmarg has not promoted inclusivity or encouraged a shift away from private motorised transport. It has also given short shrift to non-motorised transport systems, which are important for inclusivity and for reducing the city's carbon footprint. The study raises the pertinent question of whether public transport ought to be viewed as a technological fix or as part of a wider solution of urban or social issues.

Public-private partnerships have not been very successful, and the Delhi Metro, which is considered to be the most successful project despite falling far short of its projected number of users, enjoys numerous tax benefits not offered to the bus system, which carries at least five times more trips. Metro projects around the country are planned and implemented in isolation without any concern for feeder trips and other modes of transport. In short, the current regime seems to be biased towards the magnitude of capital required for construction of a metro system, rather than the magnitude of its benefits.

Road accidents are the sixth leading cause of death in the country, and there were nearly 1,40,000 deaths from road accidents in 2012. Despite being a major public health issue that affects the most vulnerable and also the most productive sections of society, road safety has not received the attention it deserves. This paper discusses how the government has not recognised road safety as a key mobility, health, and equity issue, and has been slow in enacting legislation to establish the institutional mechanisms to promote it.

But it is unlikely to succeed if it asks courts to give directions to the government on a wide range of road safety policies, or if it asks for amendments to the law, or if it asks the judges to direct the government on desired legislation. It has a fair likelihood of success in a high court if the petitioners focus on aspects of road safety for which laws are already on the books but are not being enforced properly. The Supreme Court is likely to consider the issue favourably only if the petitioners make a convincing argument that unsafe roads have a negative impact on a fundamental constitutional right.

Illustrating the politics of privileging car users over the vast majority that uses public transport like buses, this paper points to the vicissitudes the bus rapid transit system in Delhi has gone through from its introduction in 2005 to the present. Given that there is already little space and energy for more cars in India's cities, and the social and political problems they engender, the vicious cycle within which the system is trapped has to be broken. But that is easier said than done.

The central government announced the National Urban Transport Policy in 2006, a policy which aims to provide the appropriate framework for addressing transport-related challenges in India's cities. This paper examines the policy document and compares it with the policy regime now prevailing. Observing that the new policy has almost as many weaknesses as strengths, it points to the huge gap between the NUTP and the reality on the country's urban roads. It also suggests what could be done on the policy front to streamline urban public transport systems.

Following these developments, alongside other post-liberalisation regulatory reforms, in 1998 the central government published its biomedical waste (management and handling) rules. In Chennai, the implementation of the rules has simultaneously, if inadvertently, consolidated and intensified the commoditisation of biomedical waste. This paper argues that this traffic in medical garbage is not a product of neo-liberalism in India. Instead, it is through innumerable stories like this that the "Indian neo-liberal" gains meaning.

However, the reality was that while the princes appeared superficially to enshrine an exotic Oriental past in their courtly and private life, the general development was carried out on the line of the colonial model. The ideological boundaries between the princely states and British territories were fluid and there was visible cross-pollination between the sociocultural and political issues and movements of the two territories. In fact, the colonial state used a number of methods to produce the effect of colonial power in the princely states. The coastal Andhra ruling class has continued a similar strategy after the formation of Andhra Pradesh state in order to subordinate the people of Telangana.

Each is an event on its own, but each telescopes into the other to give an intriguing picture of a multifaceted man. The letters that Tagore wrote and received from the two scientist-intellectuals are also analysed. Tagore was no ordinary nationalist and went beyond the tired categories of the modern nation state. He wanted India to smell the West, taste it and understand the differences within it. He realised that imperialism is only one phase of the West, that there were other Wests that one could talk to and conspire with.

Those problems can be traced to the autocratic narcissism and ineptitude of former Chief Minister B S Yeddyurappa. The Congress thus owes a great debt to its adversaries.

Econometric analysis using a simple calorie demand function confirms the significance of variables relating to public distribution system access, controlling for other covariates, in its contribution to calorie intake. Results also suggest that the calorie-elasticity of PDS transfers is twice as large compared to additional out-of-pocket income equal to the cash equivalent of PDS transfers. These are also confirmed by non-parametric analysis of calorie intake of various consumer groups. Although preliminary, these results suggest caution in advocating cash transfers as substitute of in-kind transfers. Finally, the paper evaluates concerns about the financial implications of the minimum support price-PDS system in light of the recently enacted National Food Security Act.

Moreover, the relationship between disease and food intake is multiplicative rather than additive, and omission of disease conditions from the discourse biases any arguments made about income, caloric intake and nutrition. A holistic view shows that there is room to hope that the nutritional status of children in India will improve with the right policy emphasis.

The central government's decision to create a new state is seen as an official recognition of the people's aspiration for identity and self-rule. Interrogating such perceptions, this article examines the process by which a Telangana identity has been constructed and throws light on different factors that contributed to it. The Telangana identity is built partly on fact, and partly on half-truths, prejudices, and false hopes. Apart from intellectuals, the resurrection of the regional identity has been facilitated by the opportunism of political parties, in particular, the unjustifiable inaction of the left.

Part I outlines the dimensions involved, in terms of reach, transfer content and physical leakages, and deals with the impact of these transfers on poverty as officially measured. Part II reports the impact of these transfers on calorie intakes and also discusses some issues regarding the financial cost of these transfers. Contrary to the view that food self-sufficiency and income growth have reduced the need for direct food interventions, the paper reports a significant increase in contribution of in-kind transfers to both poverty reduction and nutrition. Moreover, much of this increased impact is attributable to improved public distribution system efficiency. The first part, presented here, was motivated by some issues that arose in the context of the Tendulkar method of estimating poverty as regards its treatment of food prices. This method treats food prices differently from the earlier Lakdawala method and is sensitive to treatment of in-kind food transfers. The paper suggests a decomposition method that modifies the Tendulkar poverty lines and distinguishes between household out-of-pocket expenditures and transfers received from the PDS and mid-day meals. The poverty reducing impact of these food transfers is found to have increased over time and is more pronounced in the case of distribution-sensitive measures of poverty.

A prolific writer about India's place in the world and the nature of interstate relations, Sarkar was (and is) widely considered an "internationalist" and anti-imperialist. By focusing on Sarkar's fundamentally ambivalent outlook on the rise of a powerful Japan, this article argues that his internationalism and anti-imperialism were both compromised by a particular historical location, which had to do with the gendered concerns of the Indian nationalist elite, and his infatuation with a model of nationhood and power indebted to right-wing European ideologies and political developments.

India's coal reserves are smaller than estimated and the flurry of coal-based power plants that have been approved in recent years has seen a frenetic rush to tie up coal resources, which at this rate would last no more than 20 years. Auction of mines is by itself no solution to the problems created by private allotment; auctions need to be carefully crafted and there should be production-sharing contracts monitored by a statutory regulator. Last but not the least, there is the issue of pollution and environment degradation caused by the mining and burning of coal. India needs a strategy based on demand management of energy, including introducing efficiency improvements in both the coal and the electricity sectors. It also needs to make a decisive shift in favour of renewable sources of energy. The country needs to move away from coal as quickly as possible.

But they make it possible for policymakers to officially acknowledge the prevalence of exclusionary practices in schools and the urgent need to address them. One of the overarching insights from this study is the need to view inclusion and exclusion from different vantage points: from the outside (who goes to what kind of school); from the inside (what happens inside the school); and in society (who is visible and who is not visible; for example, seasonal or new migrants are often invisible in data on out-of-school children). Equally significant is the influence of the larger society and social norms on what happens inside a school, the attitude and behaviour of teachers and the involvement or lack of involvement of parents and community leaders. Political and social assertion of the rights of dalits and adivasis also influences practices and attitudes.

It takes a spatial approach to analysing markets for urban domestic work, where issues of location, distance, travel, and timings are found to determine the opportunities for employment. In addition, it looks at domestic work against the background of larger employment markets for low-skilled female workers, and the range of options and preferences that frame it.

Given the specificity of paid domestic work in urban employment, this study argues that both the supply of labour and negotiation of the wage are as much influenced by ideologies of feminine domesticity, performance of work in familial spaces and the social construction of skill, on the one hand, as by competition and lack of alternative opportunities and social security, on the other. In exploring the process of bargaining, it critically examines the role of recruitment agencies and unionisation. While the former becomes simply a "middleman", the latter moves at a slow pace caught between the dual role of organiser and employer.

Minimum wages for domestic workers in the few states where it is mandated are among the lowest in the informal sector, reflecting the undervaluation of housework even when it enters the market. Better statutory minimum wages for domestic workers would not only help protect their rights, but could also shake the social and political foundations of household work, leading to a new valuation of it.

Responses to the play have been split largely along caste lines, with upper-caste audiences and critics regarding it as an expose of liberal reformism, and dalits either ignoring it or regarding its depiction of dalit masculinity as offensive. But few have commented on how the play pits its version of female agency against a particular vision of dalit masculinity. This paper sets the play in the context of Tendulkar's particular engagement with Dalit Panther literature, but argues that it also speaks to ongoing debates on sexual violence and on the literary representation of transgressive passion. It shows how Kanyadaan both unravels and embodies the most troubled aspects of the relationship between caste and gender in postcolonial India.

The most worrisome aspect is the high inflation in a majority of food articles in the last six years or so despite a favourable domestic food supply situation and low global food prices. Based on the analysis of the food expenditure pattern during 2004-12, this article points out that rising domestic demand pressures have contributed to a surge in the prices of six high-value food commodities â€” pulses, milk, egg, fish, meat and edible oil. Another possible reason for stubborn food prices is the rising cost of production of food commodities.

This is an innovative conditional cash transfer programme to provide monetary incentives to women to deliver in medical facilities. This study evaluates its functioning by using a unique data set covering eight districts spread across seven "low performing states" in the country. It shows that JSY is working reasonably well, judging by the proportion of women receiving incentives after delivering in a government facility, location of receiving incentives, mode of payments and payment of bribes. But the accredited social health activists, an important component of JSY, play a limited role in facilitating delivery in a medical facility. Importantly, even though the proportion of women delivering in a medical facility has improved considerably, a significant fraction of women continues to deliver at home. These women are more disadvantaged than those who deliver in government facilities.

The incidence of tenancy there has been found to be extensive, virtually all of which is informal and concealed from the law. Concealed tenancy is an unwarranted outcome of certain restrictive provisions in the tenancy law prevailing in the state as much as the shortening of the duration of tenancy contracts. Both outcomes have adverse implications for efficient, sustainable and equitable use of agricultural land under lease. Given the fact that supply of land for lease is expected to increase in the future as suggested by the present study, reforms in the tenancy law are required in order to ensure efficient and equitable utilisation of these lands. This, in turn, will involve relaxing the restrictive provisions of the law enabling separation of the user right of land from the right of ownership.

Given Indian society's insatiable hunger for gold and that nearly all of it has to come in through imports paid for by savings that now cannot be used for productive purposes, these were bound to hit the wall sooner or later. Though stopping people from buying gold is not going to happen, public policies have to discourage gold purchases through the promotion of financial products, fiscal measures, and administrative controls.

Evidence from Special Economic Zones in Gujarat||AMITA SHAH||Gujarat, which till recently was known as a relatively hassle-free state for industrialisation, is now experiencing increasing resistance to the conversion of farmland for industry-infrastructure development. While the growing unrest could be attributed to a complex mix of economic, political and cultural factors, a substantial part of it is also the result of the virtual absence of an information-sharing process and an almost complete denial of meaningful dialogue between the state and local communities. Though the new law on land acquisition and rehabilitation tries to address this critical gap, how it actually plays out will depend on how affected people perceive the gains and losses from mega projects. This paper examines the experiences of local communities affected by three major special economic zones in Gujarat.

This result must be seen in the context of neo-liberal policy, the financial crisis and consequent global recession affecting export production, the rapid rise in food prices, declining employment growth, the drought of 2009-10, and in spite of a positive development like the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. It is argued that the decline claimed in the official poverty ratios is spurious.

The author of this paper outlines another way of thinking about pedagogy guided by his own experience as a teacher.

A Statistical Note||R NAGARAJ and SHRUTI PANDEY||In the popular and media imagination, fed by economists and columnists, Gujarat and Bihar have both recorded an extraordinary economic performance in the past decade. But a careful analysis shows that Gujarat, always one of the richest states, has done no better than before. In neither industry nor agriculture has its position radically changed. The only dramatic difference has been the emergence of import-dependent and export-oriented petroleum refining, which has few linkages with the state economy. As in the past decades, Gujarat's social development continues to lag behind its economic development. Likewise, Bihar's position at the bottom of the league has not changed dramatically. Change seems to take place very slowly at the regional level.

The overarching narrative appears to be that cities are violent spaces that women are better off not accessing at all. This paper attempts to make a case for women and others accessing a city which is perceived as hostile, and to do so without being censured. It argues that loitering offers the possibility of rewriting the city as a more inclusive, diverse and pleasurable one.
Vol. 48, No. 39 (SEPTEMBER 28, 2013)||special article||Caste in a Casteless Language? English as a Language of 'Dalit' Expression||RITA KOTHARI||This paper focuses on a new archive of dalit writing in English translation. The "archive" has a forced homogeneity imposed by the term "dalit", which embraces an urban middle-class dalit and a member of a scavenger caste; the homogeneity is consolidated by the fact that the translated texts are in an international language. The questions asked concern the relationship between caste and the English language, two phenomena that represent considerably antithetical signs. Dalit writers accept English as a target language, despite the fact that local realities and registers of caste are difficult to couch in a language that has no memory of caste. The discussion shows how English promises to dalit writers (as both individuals and representatives of communities) agency, articulation, recognition and justice. The paper draws attention to the multiplicity of contexts that make writing by dalits part of a literary public sphere in India, and contribute to our thinking about caste issues in the context of human rights.
Vol. 48, No. 39 (SEPTEMBER 28, 2013)||special article||Nagaland's Demographic Somersault||ANKUSH AGRAWAL and VIKAS KUMAR||After two decades of very high growth, Nagaland's population declined between 2001 and 2011 though there were no epidemical diseases, wars, famines, natural calamities, political disturbances, or any significant changes in the state's socio-economic characteristics. This decline is unprecedented in the history of independent India. It has been shown that the census estimates of the state's population for 1981-2001 are internally inconsistent. In the light of this, this paper uses information from the Sample Registration System and National Family Health Surveys to examine the reliability of the census figures in Nagaland between 1971 and 2011. It suggests that the census estimates are inconsistent with these sources of information.

Though it has been rising, it is at a lower level than that observed for 2001-05. This has been accompanied by shifts in the relative ranking of different districts across the income distribution. Data does not point to the convergence of per capita incomes across districts. The historical composition of incomes, in particular the share of the tertiary sector in GDP, is an important predictor of divergence in district per capita incomes.

This combination of outcomes then feeds a downward spiral, of which rupee depreciation aggravated by speculation is one symptom. Unwilling or unable to address these structural weaknesses, the government is seeking a solution in enhanced foreign capital inflows and is therefore desperately wooing foreign investors. While the logic and potential success of that effort is uncertain, its cost is likely to be a turn to austerity that can convert a difficult macroeconomic situation into one of crisis.

What is public knowledge could not be proved in the court of law. It is now over a year since the high court judgment in the Bathani Tola case of 1996 was challenged in the Supreme Court. The hearings are yet to begin. A closer look at this massacre, and the everyday criminal activities that preceded it, shows how absence of timely intervention enhances predisposition to crime and paves the way to repeated massacres. As this case illustrates, the tardy and often biased functioning of the Indian judicial system undermines its basic purpose. Where justice fails, vengeance prevails.

Lived experience, on the other hand, foregrounds the experience of racism, exclusion and difference. This paper seeks to understand the typical immigrant's desire to migrate out of India and the experience of migration in a region of northern Italy. It attempts to do so by understanding the aspirations of potential immigrants in terms of what Europe signifies and the lived experience of immigrants of Indian origin in northern Italy. The analysis is based on interviews with potential migrants in New Delhi and in the region of Emilia-Romagna in northern Italy, more specifically in Fidenza and Parma.

Even if the crisis in the North is resolved, developing countries are likely to encounter a much less favourable global economic environment in the coming years than they did earlier. If they wish to repeat the spectacular growth they enjoyed in the run-up to the crisis, they need to improve their own growth fundamentals, rebalance domestic and external sources of growth, and reduce their dependence on foreign markets and capital. This requires abandoning the Washington Consensus, and seeking strategic rather than full integration with the global economy.

It emphasises the importance of locating cultures of resistance within the paradigms of social history. Alongside, it stresses the importance of seeing resistance as an interactive process involving a host of complexities. While highlighting the importance of the way the oppressed invented survival strategies, the article discusses the interrogations and contestations through which the marginal sections challenged the colonialist and the internal exploiting classes. It argues that these features need to be seen holistically in order to grasp the diversities of popular resistance.
Vol. 48, No. 37 (SEPTEMBER 14, 2013)||special article||Death and Desire in Times of Revolution||SARMISTHA DUTTA GUPTA||This paper engages with the choices made by Pritilata Waddedar (1911-32), a member of the Chittagong-based Indian Republican Army, who died on 24 September 1932 after successfully leading a siege on the Pahartali European Club in Chittagong. Pritilata has long been accorded iconic status as a virangana in nationalist historiography. Her dying statement has been studied by historians to understand whether and how the politicisation of women in anti-colonial struggles resulted in a reordering of gender relations. This article engages with the complexity of Hindu women's participation in militant anti-colonial struggles by problematising the choices made by them. It attempts a decentring of knowledge by exposing to scrutiny areas of "private" experience of women in "public"/"political" movements through a reading of the writings of Pritilata, Kalpana Dutt and Surya Sen.

The new CTs account for almost 30% of the urban growth in the last decade. The estimated contribution of migration is similar to that in previous intercensal periods. Further, the data indicates a dispersed pattern of in situ urbanisation, with the reluctance of state policy to recognise new statutory towns partly responsible for the growth of new CTs. A growing share of India's urban population, living in these CTs, is being governed under the rural administrative framework, despite very different demographic and economic characteristics, which may affect their future growth.

This paper proposes overhauling the methodology of planning from below to put the experiment back on track. This will involve demystifying and debureaucratising the planning process and strengthening participatory spaces. However, the enthusiasm for maximising participation should not be at the expense of the right to be critical. People's participation is not a substitute for expertise in development planning. Participatory planning has to make maximum use of the expertise within the government and outside it without compromising on accountability and responsiveness to the people.

Even so, the number of titles granted to tribal households is small compared to their total number in the state. Effective and comprehensive implementation of the FRA will have a significant impact on the livelihood of forest dwellers and the conservation of forests.

As a result, both countries today have an excess of males and a shortage of females. Much of the work on adverse sex ratios until now has largely dealt with the identification, patterns, and causes of skewed sex ratios, and not their consequences. This review examines the emerging literature on the social consequences of the gender imbalance, and the five papers that follow explore the relationship of sex ratios with other social dimensions.

Sex Ratio Imbalance and Shifting Social Practices in Northern India||MATTIAS LARSEN and RAVINDER KAUR||Attempting to ascertain whether the skewed sex ratio in three northern districts of India has led to a change in sex-selective behaviour and related practices, this study finds that a shortage of brides is associated with willingness to compromise on rules of clan exogamy, and with a reduced demand for dowry. There is also a shift in inheritance patterns and increased societal acceptance of husbands living with their wives' parents in uxorilocal residence. In addition, more women are likely to be aware of their legal entitlement to a share of their parents' property, and to give less importance to the cultural construct of a son preference. It has to be seen whether all this will bring about a long-term change in patriarchal social structures.
Vol. 48, No. 35 (AUGUST 31, 2013)||consequences of gender imbalance||The Effect of a Male Surplus on Intimate Partner Violence in India||SUNITA BOSE, KATHERINE TRENT and SCOTT J SOUTH||Theories of the social consequences of imbalanced sex ratios posit that men will exercise strict control over women's behaviour when women's relationship options are plentiful and men's own options are limited. Using data from the third National Family and Health Survey, this paper investigates the effect of the community sex ratio on women's experience of intimate partner violence in India. Multilevel logistic regression models show that a relative surplus of men in a community increases the likelihood of physical abuse by husbands even after adjusting for various other individual, household, and geographic characteristics. Further evidence of control over women when there is a sex ratio imbalance is provided by the increased odds of husbands distrusting wives with money.

This paper uses the concept of ecology of choice in mate selection to demonstrate how different social processes and practices have ramifications on who can marry, who they can marry, and under what circumstances. It points to the historical and cultural practices of patrilineage, hypergamy, and concubinage, which contributed to a marriage squeeze long before the sex ratio at birth became an issue. It also examines how the policies of the Chinese Communist Party have affected social institutions related to marriage, reinforcing the marriage squeeze, and discusses the implications of this.

This paper points out that such unions are accepted locally in the face of necessity. Although apprehensions have been raised about cross-region brides and their children facing caste discrimination, several studies have found this to be largely untrue. In cross-region marriages, the caste difference between the spouses is an important factor, not in terms of it being a ground for discrimination, but in terms of the adjustments that cross-region brides have to make to follow new caste practices after marriage.

The Indian economy grew at unprecedented rates during the Tenth (2002-07) and Eleventh (2007-12) Five-Year Plan periods, but it has been characterised by jobless growth and informalisation of jobs in the organised sector between 2004-05 and 2009-10. However, findings from the latest employment and unemployment survey of the National Sample Survey Office (2011-12) seem to suggest a reversal of joblessness with a significant increase in non-agricultural employment. The paper tries to assess the employment intensity of output growth through an examination of employment elasticity, and potential for employment generation during the Twelfth Five-Year Plan (2012-17).

In fact, the economic concerns that are motivating people are themselves inextricable from political problems, persecution and other forms of discrimination and injustice.

It finds that despite substantial increase in absolute credit deployed through the banks, the share of credit to MSEs in general, and manufacturing MSEs in particular declined, picking up only over the past few years. Within the manufacturing sector, bank credit went mainly to large and medium sized manufacturing units. The evidence is indicative of structural retrogression of credit to MSEs and contradicts the notion of price signals in the credit market allocating credit to sectors like MSE at higher interest rates, thereby generating additional income, employment and demand for goods and services, and in turn, supplementing the National Manufacturing Policy's objective of high growth in the manufacturing sector to generate 100 million jobs in the next five years.

It points out that at the heart of the present stimulus-austerity debate is the effectiveness of Keynesian stimulus policies during episodes of growth falling below potential, and classifies growth crises into three different types for analytical clarity. Analysis shows that though the growth crisis in advanced economies has spilled over into developing ones through trade and investment channels, its nature is different. The focus in these countries should therefore be on addressing supply shocks and structural reforms, including investment in infrastructure, through a change in the fiscal mix.

Conceptualising the displacements in rhythmic terms, it first details the subversion of progressive land reforms and the reassertion of caste-based oppression, followed by the clash between the dharma of the spirits of the land and the neo-liberal dharma of capitalistic development. Finally, it looks at life in a resettlement colony where families that have been uprooted from the agricultural production cycle are closed off from the urban life they are expected to adopt.

It is reasonable to expect that these understate the prevalence of crime, since victims may choose not to report crime to the police, and when they do, police may choose not to record crime. In this article, police-recorded crime is compared with victim-reported crime and an estimate of the magnitude of under-recording is developed. Even if understated, police statistics could still be informative of crime patterns if regions with high victim-reported crime also have high police-recorded crime. This article explores whether victim-reported crime is a predictor of police-recorded crime and finds that police records do contain valuable information about actual crime.

Yields are driven by numerous factors, and there will be variance â€” field-to-field, season-to-season. Despite this, Bt cotton has been agro-economically successful because of the lower cost of production per unit and thus higher net returns â€” facts that are consistent with the near universal adoption of Bt technology by farmers.

These policy debates, while important, tend to obscure the strong methodological and theoretical consensus in the economics profession today. All major schools of mainstream macroeconomics are committed to a vision of the economy in which rational agents choose the optimal path over time, and in which any sources of instability are fully offset by a benevolent central bank, at least in normal times. These core intellectual commitments of modern economics have contributed to the weakness of efforts to reduce unemployment in the US and Europe. This paper first describes the intellectual failure of the most prominent arguments for austerity, and then argues that the deeper consensus in macroeconomics has nonetheless made it difficult to make consistent arguments for sustained deficit spending or for making lower unemployment a high priority relative to other macroeconomic goals.
Vol. 48, No. 32 (AUGUST 10, 2013)||special article||Stereotypical Occupational Segregation and Gender Inequality: An Experimental Study||SAVITA KULKARNI and NEERAJ HATEKAR||This paper attempts to distinguish "trust in cooperation" and "trust in ability" with respect to gender in an experimental trust game. "Trust in ability" with respect to gender is explored in the context of hands-on mechanical ability where females are stereotypically believed to be inefficient. Such stereotypes govern, directly or indirectly, women's access to education and employment, resulting in occupational segregation of the labour market. All this further intensifies gender inequality. We observed higher probability of exhibiting stereotype among men and women paired with other women, despite a statistically insignificant gender gap in actual mechanical performances. This indicates that "trust in ability" can be governed by such stereotypes and affect economic outcomes. We seek causes of the prevalence of gender stereotype in evolutionary psychology. We also describe the demotivating psychological process women suffered from, due to endorsement of such stereotypes by society.
Vol. 48, No. 32 (AUGUST 10, 2013)||special article||Marginal Occupations and Modernising Cities: Muslim Butchers in Urban India||ZARIN AHMAD||On 29 October 2009, the Supreme Court of India passed a judgment ordering the final closure of the 95-year-old Idgah abattoir in Delhi. The abattoir was shifted to a mechanised modern plant in the eastern fringes of the city. Using the issue of relocation and modernisation as a starting point, this essay addresses the impact of planning and transformation of urban spaces on traditional and marginal occupations. Located in a multi-sited ethnography of the working lives of people in the meat sector, it emphasises the complexities of understanding an entangled reality. Butchers live and work in an intricate web of social, spatial and occupational relations. Hence, spatial and technological relocation is not only about losing skill sets and livelihoods. It challenges the very access to labour and uproots people from social and emotional spaces critical for stigmatised and marginal occupations who draw strength and support from familiar landscapes.

Vol. 48, No. 31 (AUGUST 3, 2013)||special article||Missing Labour or Consistent "De-Feminisation"?||VINOJ ABRAHAM||"Missing labour force in India"â€”the recent fluctuations in the labour participation of women â€” is probably due to short-term shifts in activities responding to favourable economic conditions. Such fluctuations need to be placed in the context of a structural change in labour participation wherein the share of women in the labour force as well as labour participation rate of women has been declining for the last quarter of a century. Upward social mobility in Indian patriarchal society in the wake of growing incomes is probably symbolised by women's withdrawal from paid labour and their confinement to unpaid domestic activities. Even under such adverse conditions employment growth of women is not stagnant. Those who do enter and remain in the labour market are women from the most vulnerable households, as marginalised informal paid labour, thus feminising the most precarious forms of labour in the country.

It is argued that the growing trade deficit and the changed nature of recent foreign direct investment inflows already throw up industrial policy and financial regulatory challenges before India for developing dynamic competitiveness and reducing financial fragility in the economy. The investment provisions in the recent comprehensive trade agreements compound the dissonance between India's development needs and industrial and macroeconomic policies by putting World Trade Organisation-plus constraints on the country's regulatory ability.

Delays at different levels owing to improper and multiple referrals by facilities, absence of easily accessible and quality emergency obstetric care, lack of transport facilities and high out-of-pocket expenditure seem to be the main non-medical factors for the high maternal mortality rate.

Simultaneously, monetary policy has been loaded with several additional onerous responsibilities. In such a situation, the single instrument of the repo rate (supplemented with the cash reserve ratio) exhibits considerable strain in striking a balance between the conflicting objectives of growth, inflation control and financial stability. The interest rate also turns out to be a blunt instrument, leading to blunderbuss and debt footprint effects. To overcome the imbalance between targets and instruments, a maverick suggestion has emerged, viz, shifting the reserves from the liability to the asset side of financial institutions' balance sheets. Asset-based reserve requirements share some similarities with capital requirements and dynamic loan loss provisioning, but differ from these in important details. This paper examines the implications of ABRRs for monetary policy, together with their limitations and difficulties of implementation in an emerging market economy like India.

It finds that the per capita total cereal consumption (i e, direct plus indirect) has a very strong association with per capita real income, though of course there are other factors which influence it too. The association is so strong that one would not be wrong in taking cereal consumption as a proxy for real income as has been suggested in the ongoing poverty debate in India.

This article holds that plans for higher densities in cities such as Mumbai should include urban peripheral nodes and not just the urban core and central business district. Managing land uses and supplying infrastructure is easier in emerging urban nodes, which can encourage a balance between housing and jobs, and help establish an efficient use of expensive transportation infrastructure. To make this a reality, the development focus should equally be on improving institutional capacity.

Through this decision as with a similar one in 2009, the government has compromised economic reasoning at the altar of crony capitalism and political expediency.

Instead, a Group of Ministers has taken a decision which could transfer up to Rs 26,000 crore a year to producers, especially one private company.

It finds clear and persistent caste and gender disparities throughout. Scheduled caste and scheduled tribe businesses are under-represented, except in the north-eastern states. However, the share of female-owned and managed enterprises is significantly greater among SC-ST owned enterprises. Also, there is evidence of homophily in Other Backward Classes and upper-caste owned firms, suggesting that the rise in dalit entrepreneurship is crucial to increasing dalit employment in the small business sector.

Vol. 48, No. 26/27, Supplement: Review of Rural Affairs (JUNE 29-JULY 6, 2013)||----||The Stunted Structural Transformation of the Indian Economy: Agriculture, Manufacturing and the Rural Non-Farm Sector||HANS P BINSWANGER-MKHIZE||India's economy has accelerated sharply since the late 1980s, but agriculture has not. The rural population and labour force continue to rise, and rural-urban migration remains slow. Despite a rising labour productivity differential between non-agriculture and agriculture, limited rural-urban migration and slow agricultural growth, urban-rural consumption, income, and poverty differentials have not been rising. Urban-rural spillovers have become important drivers of the rapidly growing rural non-farm sector, which now generates the largest number of jobs in India. Rural non-farm self-employment is especially dynamic with farm households diversifying into the sector to increase income. The bottling up of labour in rural areas means that farm sizes will continue to decline, agriculture will continue its trend to feminisation, and part-time farming will become the dominant farm model.
Vol. 48, No. 26/27, Supplement: Review of Rural Affairs (JUNE 29-JULY 6, 2013)||----||Drivers of Non-Farm Employment in Rural India: Evidence from the 2009-10 NSSO Round||MANOJ JATAV and SUCHARITA SEN||This paper attempts to understand the processes of growth in rural non-farm employment based on the 2009-10 employment and unemployment round of the National Sample Survey Office. The rural non-farm sector has undergone major restructuring which has led to an increase in the share of casual labour in the non-farm sector accompanied by a continuous decline in the share of self and regular employment. On the basis of multivariate analyses at two levels, this study concludes that though non-farm employment in rural areas is primarily distress-driven, there are some significant entry barriers for rural workers in the non-farm sector in terms of education, age and gender. Considering the overall deceleration of rural employment until 2009-10, the paper emphasises the importance of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in rural employment generation and the consequent process of feminisation of casual workforce in the non-farm sector that has emerged in the last five years. The results indicate the crisis of joblessness would have been more acute without the scheme. The overall quality of rural employment, driven by distress factors, has deteriorated in 2009-10 over 2004-05 in a significant way.
Vol. 48, No. 26/27, Supplement: Review of Rural Affairs (JUNE 29-JULY 6, 2013)||----||Agrarian Structure and Land Lease Arrangements: An Investigation in Nine Villages in Andhra Pradesh||R VIJAY and Y SREENIVASULU||The Indian rural economic structure has been undergoing changes. One aspect of this is the growth of households who own land but do not cultivate it themselves. An implication of this is the potential for tenancy acquiring increasing importance in the rural sector. This study uses data from nine villages in Andhra Pradesh to present the relative significance of these households and analyse the resource adjustment process in the land lease market. The presence of non-cultivating peasant households in rural areas and tenancy contracts becoming the dominant institution for resource adjustment can act as a shackle on agricultural growth and development of the economy.

It examines the reasons for this and also looks into how farmers have been responding to lowered groundwater tables. Besides identifying some factors that have not changed since the mid-1980s, it emphasises that there are wide regional variations in the country's groundwater economy and management strategies need to be crafted accordingly.
Vol. 48, No. 26/27, Supplement: Review of Rural Affairs (JUNE 29-JULY 6, 2013)||----||An Inquiry into the Composition of Farm Revenue Risk: The Case of Six Vidarbha Districts||THIAGU RANGANATHAN and SARTHAK GAURAV||In a liberalised economy, a fundamental understanding of the components of farm revenue risk through the relationship between yield and price risk is imperative. This study decomposes the changes in revenue risk over two decades of cotton cultivation in six districts of the Vidarbha region in Maharashtra into changes in price risk, yield risk, and the natural hedge. Examining data in two periods, 1991-2002 and 2003-11, it shows that though there has been a reduction in price variances, the increase in covariance between yield and price and the change in yield variance have caused increased riskiness in cotton revenues. It also indicates directions for future policies.
Vol. 48, No. 26/27, Supplement: Review of Rural Affairs (JUNE 29-JULY 6, 2013)||----||A Future Orientation to Agrarian Livelihoods: A Case Study of Rural Telangana||TANYA JAKIMOW, LIANA J WILLIAMS and CHIRANJEEVI TALLAPRAGADA||This paper argues that a future orientation to livelihoods research is needed which pays explicit attention to the trends and dynamics of household livelihoods. An analytical framework is presented that consider: dispositions of different groups, the influence of sociocultural environments, the different role of actors in reinforcing or transforming sociocultural environments, and the broader structural conditions including exclusion and terms of incorporation. This framework is applied to the analysis of different groupings of farmers in two villages in the Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh to highlight processes that result in upward and downward mobility for different social groups. The paper concludes that a future orientation to livelihoods research provides a more nuanced picture as compared to economic calculations of farm viability and the ability and willingness of different household groupings to invest in agriculture. Second, by employing this approach, the identification of groups that will suffer chronic poverty, or alternatively, those at the risk of downward mobility is enhanced. Finally, a future orientation to livelihoods helps to identify institutional and structural conditions that adversely shape livelihoods, and therefore where priority investments could be made.

The same was said at the 1992 Earth Summit as well. The only thing added in 2012 was the concept of the "Green Economy" to reduce the impact of the Brown Economy model of growth the world over. The Green Economy model is portrayed as an opportunity to enhance ecosystem services, and enable growth and sustainable livelihoods for the poor. But this well-intended vision is without a design to enable green investments to reduce carbon intensities and a framework for creating global Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) market opportunities without jeopardising the basic right to livelihood. The 2012 report reveals a total disjoint between a vision and the operational feasibility of a Green Economy.

While angry customers exacerbate worker stress and intensify the need for training, they also serve a "productive" purpose in the everyday creation and perpetuation of western nationalism. The western state and public discourses on offshoring sanction customer aggression on calls; these calls provide opportunities for customers to exercise citizenship rights over jobs which are assumed to have been stolen, and in so doing, continually define and then protect assets (jobs) which belong to the nation. In essence, customers in the west enact patriotism through their anger.

Estimating the average level of ownership in 2025 at 35 per 1,000, this article points out that the growing number of cars has serious implications for energy security, air pollution, road safety, and equitable allocation of road space, and argues that there is an urgent need for India to learn from the experiences of cities that have decoupled car ownership from economic growth, and reduce the rate of growth of car ownership in India.

This literature has not, however, constructed a convincing history of the non-violent method. Most have depicted it as a timeless phenomenon, found in all historical societies in one form or another. Rather, it is, as this essay suggests, a method rooted in modernity, arising out of a particular strategic reaction to the coercive and legal apparatuses of the modern state.

Bodos and the non-Bodo indigenous people, who were fighting with each other for space and identity till 1998, have arrived at a tactical alliance. The crisis in Bodoland is a reflection of the abdication of responsibility by the Indian state. It has failed to address the structural issues that confront the indigenous tribes (the Bodos), like the encroachment of their land. It has also failed to address the multicultural, multi-linguistic and multi-ethnic composite culture of the region.

Due to the absence of reliable vital statistics for Indian districts, fertility levels are assessed using a set of indirect methods. Using mortality estimates and the child population aged 0-6 years to estimate the number of births during the seven years preceding the census, figures for crude birth rates and fertility rates are derived for all Indian districts. The results are compared with those derived from the 2001 Census. Our analysis points, in particular, to the significant population overcount in Jammu and Kashmir during the 2011 Census and the continuous but extremely slow process of fertility decline in India.

Two differences are notable, however. First, while in 1970 they voted the Pakistan Peoples Party to power, this time they came out in droves to boot it out. And second, while 1970 was a time of great hope and optimism, this year their cynicism was palpable even as they voted. This was understandable as all the main contesting parties appeared committed irrevocably to the same market liberalism that has characterised Pakistan's governments for the last three decades. In the end, people followed the only path open to them in most democracies: vote the incumbent out, even if the alternatives promise more of the same!

In this paper, we propose and develop a methodology for operationalising a co-benefits approach to climate policy formulation. We use the technique of multi-criteria analysis, which requires making choices between and examining trade-offs across multiple objectives of policy, such as growth, inclusion and environment. In addition, we develop a framework for consideration of implementation issues. We focus on policies related to energy; but we believe the approach can also be modified to address adaptation concerns. The structured tool of the sort proposed here would hopefully contribute to more informed and deliberative decision-making on climate-related issues.

While migration for domestic work is an opportunity, in the absence of social protection, it also renders such workers more vulnerable. This essay takes its cue from how the feminist movement has approached the contradictions within domestic work and the various problems that domestic workers face. It throws light on the multiple hierarchies that the domestic worker is confronted with, as also the peculiar problems that the Indian domestic worker confronts. It explores a whole lot of different aspects of the domestic employer-employee relation within the context of the near absence of state intervention and the lack of legal protection. It also delves into the attempts that some trade unions, NGOs and church-affiliated organisations have made to bring protective measures and organise domestic workers to win labour rights.

The results show that (a) the size of plots acquired were non-negligible; (b) the majority of those affected were marginal landowners engaged in cultivation; (c) the government's compensation offers were approximately equal to the reported market values of acquired plots on average, but the inability of the official land records to distinguish between plots of heterogeneous quality meant that a substantial fraction of farmers were under-compensated relative to market values; (d) those under-compensated were significantly more likely to refuse the compensation offers, as were those whose livelihoods were more dependent on agriculture; (e) incomes and durable consumption of affected owners and tenants grew slower between 2005 and 2010 compared with unaffected owners and tenants; (f) earnings of affected workers fell faster than unaffected workers. Therefore, land acquisition resulted in substantial economic hardship for large sections of the rural population, for many of whom compensation offered was inadequate.

Agrarian changes having considerably lowered the level of economic achievements of farmers, the disproportion between achievement and aspiration is greatly felt by those who experienced egoism. This study argues that anomie is an effect of egoism. The latter, a structural characteristic of modern agrarian economy and society, is the prerequisite for emergence of the former.

The economy grew at a rate close to 9% per year, until it was punctured by the financial crisis of 2008. What explains that boom? Did the sustained liberal reforms finally pay off? Or was it a debt-led, cyclical boom, coinciding with an exceptional phase in the world economy? This paper contends that it was the latter case, driven by private corporate investments, financed by rising domestic savings, and topped by unprecedented inflows of foreign capital â€” leaving behind heightened corporate leverage, and frothy asset markets. As the global economy faces a semi-slump and precarious macroeconomic balance, how to reverse the current slowdown is at the crux of the discourse on India's policy paralysis. With the corporate sector mired in over-leverage, perhaps the most credible policy options now available are to step up public infrastructure to boost investment demand, and expand bank credit on easy terms to the informal sector and agriculture â€” which were throttled during the boom years â€” so as to ease supply constraints.

It takes a close look at how their identity is shaped by the resistance of those at the margins, by politics, and by interventions on the part of external agencies. The research deconstructs (i) the everyday resistance of the Musahars, as evident from their songs and poetry; (ii) the talk of state officials and state policies about Musahars; and (iii) the discourse of social activists, organisations and donor agencies. Armed with this information, the paper attempts to view the world from the perspective of the Musahars and focuses on how they negotiate diverse discourses to their advantage in order to transgress the boundaries of marginality, and how this process changes the notion of marginality for them.

This is best done by targeting the structural rather than the cyclical fiscal deficit. There should also be a sharp shift in the composition of the deficit from consumption to addressing supply-side bottlenecks through public investment in infrastructure. Unlike public consumption which can crowd out private demand, public infrastructure investment has higher fiscal multipliers and can crowd in private investment.

This paper discusses the doctrine of eminent domain in the context of dispossession and emergent land and resource conflicts in India. The origin of the doctrine in pre-constitutional colonial law, the legal mechanisms of land reform and acquisition laws through which it finds expression, and the recently proposed mechanisms for acquisition that expand its power and conflate public purpose with private capitalist interests are discussed. The paper examines the dual nature that lends itself to redistributive justice and the dispossession of already marginalised citizenry. It then examines the vexatious concept of sovereignty animating the doctrine, discusses existing substantive limits to its power that need to be given primacy and the uneven jurisprudence around the doctrine. It argues for contextualised rights to land- and resource-use regimes, concluding with observations on the implications of the doctrine's continuing and expanded scope.

Using data on the availability of inputs from a nationally representative survey of primary health centres, a composite measure of structural quality of care for primary health centres was developed with a view to examine its geographical variation, associations with mortality and healthcare utilisation, and the determinants of better quality, giving particular attention to the role of management. The mean quality score was 52%, with large differences across regions, states and districts. Quality of care was the worst and the variation greatest in states designated by the government as low performing. Good management practices in a facility were highly correlated with better quality of care. The majority of primary health facilities in India fall far short of government minimum standards, in part explaining why most people in rural areas use private providers for outpatient care. Future research should explore the causal relationship between management practices, quality of care and patient outcomes.

They play a pivotal role in experiences and negotiations of the traumatic processes of displacement and resettlement, often involving uprooting, erasure of memory, loss of livelihoods and kinship, and coming to terms with a compromised and limited social life. While this may be true of all affected populations equally, nevertheless, it is significant to recover nuanced voices of these experiences from the caste and gender perspective to understand the emerging complex spaces on the city's periphery and new forms of urban exclusion. A large number of women who are not networked to non-governmental organisations and/or civic authorities end up becoming the most marginalised and excluded category, deprived of rights and citizenry.

This paper addresses a complex and vexed question that has been evolving and changing, especially in recent decades, namely, how to approach and understand the specificities of dalit women activists' experiences in the context of Kerala's politics and social movements. This enquiry attempts to understand the apprehensions and conflicts within public life for dalit women in Kerala and to show how the "public" itself differs according to one's location.
Vol. 48, No. 18 (MAY 4, 2013)||review of women's studies||The Mathammas: Gender, Caste and the Politics of Intersectionality in Rural Tamil Nadu||ANANDHI S||There has been hardly any scholarly engagement with patriarchal practices that link caste, gender and land relations in the case of dalits. The ways in which consideration of caste status or honour partake in patriarchy in the context of dispossessed and socially excluded communities may not be similar to the invocation of brahmanical patriarchal values. This paper attempts to capture the complexities involved in conceptualising the caste patriarchy among the dalits through their narratives and that of the upper castes, women social activists and the state on a ritual practice prevalent among the Arunthathiyars, a dalit sub-caste in rural Tamil Nadu â€” the dedication of Arunthathiyar girls and women to the goddess Mathamma.

This paper examines the manifestation of patriarchal and caste honour beyond the moment of choosing one's romantic or sexual partner. The daily codes of conduct as they operate in a rural setting are explored here through a gender-caste matrix. It argues that subordinated women can collectively challenge strictures of brahminical patriarchy, especially when our interventions address the intersectionality of caste and gender.
Vol. 48, No. 18 (MAY 4, 2013)||review of women's studies||Cultural Gandhism: Casting Out the Dalit Woman||SWATHY MARGARET||This article argues that Gandhian cultural nationalism is not just an ideology but an ideological consensus, and that it turns even opposing ideological positions like Marxism into variations of its own practices and certainties. It is the caste question that provides the ground for developing this ideological consensus, and it arises from the depoliticisation of untouchability in such a way that a dalit political subject becomes impossible to imagine. Telugu social reformers attempted to translate this logic into the cultural realm, especially through films. The paper critically analyses Gudavalli Ramabrahmam's popular Telugu social film, Malapilla, made in 1938. This film portrays untouchables in a negative light, and issues of inter-caste marriage and love constitute an important undercurrent of the narrative. Malapilla is the inaugural moment of popular cinema's investment in Gandhian nationalist politics and history.

It throws light on the contributions of those who take on the burden of social reproduction, and whose labours continue to be devalued. It also addresses the relationship, if any, between stigma/the stigmatised body and the devaluation of labour. Finally, it locates a quest related to notions of autonomy and emancipation, which perhaps has led the mainstream women's movements to distance themselves from the burden that caste places on the lives and labours of women.

This paper argues that this narrative, nearly universally accepted around the world, is false. It is the artefact of a faulty methodology that the World Health Organisation has pushed and the United Nations has supported. If appropriate corrections are applied, in all likelihood, India will be found to be ahead of Sub-Saharan Africa in child malnutrition, just as in other vital health indicators.

It examines the State's approach to women's issues through the evolution of national mechanisms as also through an understanding of the engagement of women's movements with the state, both by way of challenging and participating in its institutions. It argues that the willingness to intervene on behalf of women is determined by the interests of the state and political actors in securing and maintaining power. The questions that women's movements face are: to what extent do these national machineries effectively address the issues for which they had been created and to what extent are they able to bring in changes in the culture and practices of the bureaucratic structures of the state.

The deeper implication of the judgment is that it is not only justified to deny patents when incremental innovation is trivial as in the Glivec case. The judgment has linked the entire question of patenting with net benefits to society and has highlighted the relevance of specific conditions of a country for deciding the appropriate patent regime. What the judgment says and what it implies has tremendous significance for the patent regimes in developing countries beyond the secondary patenting issues.

Using comparable international data, this paper shows that urban prices are significantly higher than is commensurate with income and that the peaks of these prices are extraordinarily high. Similarly, rural prices in several regions are very high by international standards.

All of which means this is no mere bubble.

But, compared to China, where is the commitment to R&D? India's innovation potential is grossly underutilised. The small and medium enterprises in the industrial clusters are yet to be effectively served by the formal R&D institutes. The universities as centres of advanced learning and research suffer from official neglect. There has been little effort to set up technology parks linked to them in their vicinity.

Most studies examining the risk and protective factors of marital violence have used cross-sectional data to understand the determinants of physical and sexual marital violence. To identify determinants of recent experiences of physical and sexual marital violence, this survey collected data from 4,880 rural women of four states â€” Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Bihar â€” drawn from the National Family Health Survey-2 conducted in 1998-99 and a follow-up study for a subgroup of women carried out in 2002-03. The findings underscore the need to support programmes that aim to increase the education level of women and girls, make parents aware of the effects parental violence has on their children's well-being and improve married women's financial autonomy by increasing their financial literacy and awareness regarding various savings and asset-building options. Further, programmes and laws targeting dowry exchange and alcohol consumption need to be simultaneously developed.

Cities, like living organisms, depend on external metabolic flows to keep them alive. Among all the metabolic flows of matter and energy none is more important than water â€” especially water used for meeting basic drinking water and other domestic consumption needs. This paper develops a metabolic framework for domestic water use in Bangalore, one of the fastest growing urban agglomerations in India. Our urban metabolism framework treats the city as a tightly-coupled social-ecological system and shows that a spatially explicit understanding of consumption patterns is crucial to addressing three central aspects of the water conundrum â€” equity, ecological sustainability and economic efficiency.
Vol. 48, No. 15 (APRIL 13, 2013)||special article||Has India's Growth Story Withered?||PRACHI MISHRA||This paper analyses the growth performance in India over the past two decades. It uses several statistical and economic methodologies to estimate the growth rate of potential output. The annual growth rate of potential output is estimated for 2011 to be in the range of 7.7-8.2%. All the estimation techniques suggest that there was a big boost to potential growth between 2002 and 2007, but since then it has not increased significantly. Based on statistical approaches and conditional on moderate annual growth forecasts of 7-7.5% between 2012 and 2014, there is some evidence that the recent decline in growth is likely to be driven by structural factors. Most of the methodologies indicate that the output gap continues to be positive, suggesting caution in further loosening of the monetary policy stance. Overall, while the Indian growth story may/may not have withered, the evidence does give indications that the growth story may have faltered.

However, they have significant influence on the choices that their children make. The research finds that the real bottlenecks are the hierarchical nature of society, the lack of entrepreneurial talent and risk-taking ability in these women.

The nation and its state could not be viewed separate from the critique of political economy and the crisis of capitalism.

This perspective has, however, been largely lost in the century since, with a certain valorisation of the nation-form cut off from the global political economy, but situated within culture. This article engages with the debates initiated by Marx, Lenin, Luxemburg and Hilferding to critique the dominant terms of theorising the nation and attempts to foreground a revived Marxist understanding of nationalism.

The fiscal consolidation proposed in the Union Budget for 2013-14 is a combination of a marginal reduction in aggregate non-Plan expenditure and buoyant revenue growth. If revenue targets are not met, fiscal consolidation can go off the track as the scope for expenditure contraction is limited.
Vol. 48, No. 13 (MARCH 30, 2013)||budget 2013-14||Revealed Allocation Priorities in the Budget||ACHIN CHAKRABORTY||Looking at some aspects of the Union Budget for 2013-14 that have implications for the social sector, this article points out that there is a disturbingly large gap between budget estimates and actual expenditure on social services and rural development in several years. The trends in expenditure on these two sectors also imply that rural development has had to compete directly with social services to raise its share in allocation. In addition, the projected public expenditure on health indicates that there is a disconnect between the wishes of the Planning Commission and what is reflected in the budget.

It presents evidence to show by looking at the relationship between various measures of fiscal deficit and growth that it is the quality of the deficit that matters for growth. It is important to take into account the quality of expenditure that is reduced to curb the fiscal deficit, and avoid the tendency to create capital account surpluses for reducing the gross fiscal deficit. The United Progressive Alliance government has followed this short-sighted strategy all through and the budget for 2013-14 is no exception.

While the former is captured in detail in the budget-making exercise, the latter is not. This is the genesis of the attempts to measure the impact of tax provisions. In India, the government has been publishing a revenue foregone statement since the 2006-07 Union Budget. While there is some discussion on the revenue foregone statement as highlighting the giveaways by the government, this article draws attention to the limitations with the data presented â€” both in terms of provisions that are included and those that are excluded.

This article examines the issue of TRCs from the time of the opening up of the economy. It examines the observations of the courts and joint parliamentary committees, and international jurisprudence and argues that the Government of India in a very non-transparent manner is allowing treaty shopping to continue unabated.

The violence is now open with many observers arguing that Pakistan will need the Shia-killing non-state actors for the Afghan civil war expected to start after the US and NATO forces leave Afghanistan in 2004.
Vol. 48, No. 13 (MARCH 30, 2013)||perspectives||Cauvery Dispute: A Lament and a Proposal||RAMASWAMY R IYER||The Cauvery dispute has been adjudicated but remains unresolved. The reason is that there has been an all-round failure: confrontationist state governments, an ineffective central government, a somnolent Inter-State Council, a creaking adjudication machinery, a Supreme Court that has not been supportive of the Tribunal, the silence of the intellectuals, and alas, the failure of the "Cauvery Family". The Award now notified has to be operated, but that will not happen unless Karnataka's strong sense of injustice is assuaged to some extent. This article proposes a voluntary transfer of some part of its allocation by Tamil Nadu to Karnataka. Such an action on Tamil Nadu's part will transform the situation.

Analyses suggest that at least 218 evictions have occurred between 1990 and 2007 in the capital, covering at least 60,000 households. Using analytical and geospatial data on the evictions that took place in this period, this paper seeks to answer some key questions and argues in support of policies that favour in situ upgrading over resettlement. The political challenges to this are discussed, particularly in the light of findings that evictions occur with similar intensity regardless of which political party is in power.

While the reforms rapidly transformed the circuits of e-waste recycling in the city, the outcomes have been less than ideal for informal recyclers. This article charts the changing role of informal e-waste recyclers in the wake of the introduction of reforms and shows how reforms disconnected a majority of informal recyclers â€” who have historically underwritten the costs of disposing the city's e-waste â€” from newly modernised circuits of e-waste recycling. In sum, it reveals that the reforms provided an impetus to "corporate privatisation" and undermined the extant network of "informal privatisation" of e-waste in Bangalore.

This paper shifts the focus to examine the implementation of the UID project in sites of urban marginality. A study of homeless citizens demonstrates that the usages of UID have not shifted the goalposts but are developing along the lines of established citizen-state relationships in both the empowering and excluding dimensions of the UID. To capture the social impact of UID, debates must move beyond the notion that the transformative potential rests in technology or abstract policy and study the ways it is made available to people in their everyday life.

It finds that they perceive the state to be unresponsive to formal, contained means of making demands, and see disruptive action as the quickest means to force it to deliver on its promise of good governance. The contentiousness is often highly politicised â€” bound up with political ambitions and rivalries, electoral expectations, and patronage relationships with political figures. There is also a strong element of assumed class privilege in the outrage that they bring to the street.

As a result, metropolitan regions, which are complex entities with multiple municipal and non-municipal institutional arrangements, have become mere creatures of state governments with neither the necessary strategic flexibility nor political legitimacy. In part, this is because the 74th constitutional amendment of 1993 has failed to visualise the dynamics of large complex urban formations. This paper suggests both a need to confront this blind spot in the 74th constitutional amendment for long-term durable solutions and to creatively work through available legislative and institutional arrangements in the short to medium term.

Though cities globally face similar competitive pressures in an era of footloose capital flows, there were few readymade models of metropolitan governance on offer. Instead the international experience suggests that democratic processes matter as much as getting institutions right. Although questions of sustainability and resilience remained an intriguing but underexplored theme in the workshop, the increasing urgency of environmental governance agendas for India's megacity regions emerged as a key area for future research and policy.

Realising the demographic dividend brings to the fore the very serious challenge of skilling our labour force. But before devising the skill development strategy for these coming years, a task of great importance is to estimate the magnitude of the challenge and to assess the skill gap. This paper tries to estimate the skilling requirements, sector-wise, under different scenarios to arrive at a realistic and desirable target. No matter which scenario one ends up believing, the challenge of skill development â€” both in quantitative and qualitative terms â€” is enormous and requires a careful policy stance.
Vol. 48, No. 13 (MARCH 30, 2013)||special article||Healthcare Inequity and Physician Scarcity: Empowering Non-Physician Healthcare||ABHISHEK SHARMA, ELISSA LADD and M K UNNIKRISHNAN||The massive scarcity of physicians in India, mainly in rural areas, prompted the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to propose a three-and-a-half year Bachelor of Rural Health and Care degree designed exclusively to serve rural populations. The fierce opposition by powerful medical lobbies forced the proposal to fade away. This paper emphasises the importance of "task shifting" and "non-physician prescribing" in the global context and argues that non-physician healthcare providers would not only increase availability and accessibility to rural healthcare, but also provide an empowered second line of authority, adding to the checks and balances to the exploitative prestige-based hierarchy that pervades this knowledge-intensive service.
Vol. 48, No. 13 (MARCH 30, 2013)||special article||Why Were Some Indian States So Slow to Participate in the Turnaround?||CHETAN GHATE and STEPHEN WRIGHT||In earlier research we identified the start of the growth turnaround in the late 1980s. This is consistent with the pattern of (particularly trade) policy liberalisation at the time. Since then there has been a remarkable improvement in per capita incomes. But a puzzle remains. The change in policy should have had a symmetric effect across India. Yet the participation of different states in the turnaround has been very uneven. In this paper we examine whether the relative size of shifts in growth across states could have been predicted from data on state characteristics, measured before the turnaround. We use the "robustness" techniques first proposed by Sala-i-Martin. As might be expected, higher initial literacy, urbanisation and access to ports all predicted stronger growth. But we also find that relatively high shares of both agriculture and registered manufacturing predicted weaker growth across all sectors of a given state, suggesting negative externalities. We guess, along with some other evidence, that this reflects the negative impact of state intervention.

Vol. 48, No. 12 (MARCH 23, 2013)||commentary||IMF's New View on Capital Controls||KEVIN P GALLAGHER and JOSE ANTONIO OCAMPO||In the 1970s the International Monetary Fund became an advocate of capital account liberalisation, and in 1997 it tried to change its Articles of Agreement to include capital account convertibility among its mandates. In contrast, the IMF embraced in December 2012 a new "institutional view" on this issue. While it remains wedded to eventual financial liberalisation, it now acknowledges that free movement of capital rests on a weak intellectual foundation. This article claims that this is a step in the right direction, but that the new institutional view still suffers from a number of shortcomings.

Four decades on, Bangladesh has re-initiated a domestic war crimes trial process that contains its own power dynamics, exclusions and silences. This article weaves through divergent layers of the complex politicisation of memory by various actors. It provides a brief background of the current impasse, the fractured process and the hierarchical nature of various international discursive interventions delegitimising the trials and considers popular protests in Shahbag, Dhaka, through which collective remembrance becomes a distinct and disputed social and political practice.
Vol. 48, No. 12 (MARCH 23, 2013)||special article||Equity in Climate Change: A Suggested Approach||PRODIPTO GHOSH||The Rio Declaration of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change emphasises that human beings are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development and are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with nature. This principle affirms that considerations of human well-being should guide policymaking for sustainable development and that conservation of natural entities must be reckoned as part of such well-being. This paper suggests an equity approach for all candidate ethical principles to be subject to identical tests of invalidation, either by means of the present methodology or some other agreed methodology. Those that survive may then form the bases of climate change policymaking. The point of this paper is to start a debate.

To examine the situation in India, the use of public and private sector hospital services by economic class was analysed and the relationship between utilisation and public spending on health services and the reported out-of-pocket payments were assessed. Not surprisingly, hospital services in the private sector were found to be significantly pro-rich. In contrast to previous studies, it was found that India's poor report using hospital services in the public sector at a higher rate than the wealthy, particularly in urban areas. However, this varied across states. High OOP expenditure correlated with higher degrees of inequity, and was a likely barrier to accessing care for the poor. Further work is required to explore the significant variation seen between states and to understand the history of its development. A number of policy options are discussed to reduce inequities in access to public health services in India.

Evidence from the Capital Goods Sector in India||ADITYA MOHAN JADHAV and V NAGI REDDY||This paper investigates if foreign direct investment contributes to the growth of industry by examining the spillover gains in the capital goods sector. It compares the performance of foreign and domestic firms in the sector between 1994-95 and 2009-10 by using the asset turnover ratio (ATO) and the return on capital employed (ROCE). The results indicate that except during the high growth period 2004-08, there is no significant difference between the ATOs of domestic and foreign firms and the ROCE of foreign firms is significantly higher than that of domestic firms. However, during this high growth period, the ATO of domestic firms is significantly higher than that of foreign firms and ROCE of foreign and domestic firms are same. Thus, the spillover effects are very slow to be realised and higher benefits from FDI have accrued to foreign firms. We do not find support for FDI as one of the key drivers for industrial growth in capital goods sector as claimed by the industry captains.

The differential is significantly higher for those residing in rural areas, staying longer in hospitals, utilising private health facilities and suffering from chronic diseases. The difference is due to physicians in private hospitals prescribing more expensive drugs, subjecting patients to more clinical tests and higher charges on utilisation of amenities and facilities. The findings support the absolute income hypothesis that the economically better-off spend more on healthcare and the end-of-life care hypothesis that healthcare expenditure on efforts to save life is high.

Using survey data from Sangli district in Maharashtra, it finds that the availability of basic public services is significantly higher in female sarpanch villages compared to the male sarpanch villages when the former have been in the job for three to three-and-a-half years. Indeed, reservations have had a significant positive impact on the democratic participation of women in female sarpanch villages though the positive effects in terms of service delivery and democratic participation will take some more time to materialise.

Together these make sharecropping and rural labour extremely unviable sources of livelihood. This article looks at the agrarian crisis and the proletarianisation of the peasantry stuck halfway between the countryside and the city.
Vol. 48, No. 9 (MARCH 2, 2013)||special article||How Autonomous Are the Branches? A Study of Narendra Modi's BJP||SYLVIE GUICHARD||How are political parties organised in multilevel political systems? What are the links between the national party (or the central leadership) and its regional branches (or state units)? How much autonomy do the branches have? These classical questions of the study of political parties in federal states have found a new resonance after the recent development within the Bharatiya Janata Party. Some commentators have even considered that the party is now not more than a collection of separate state units. Along this line and focusing on Gujarat, the author argues and shows how over the last 10 years the Gujarat branch of the BJP has become an autonomous regional party.
Vol. 48, No. 9 (MARCH 2, 2013)||special article||Expansion of Social Assistance: Does Politics Matter?||SONY PELLISSERY and ARMANDO BARRIENTOS||This paper examines the significance of politics in the rise of social assistance programmes in developing countries in the last decade on the basis of case studies of India, Brazil and South Africa. Most of the literature on social assistance is focused on design and outcomes, but ignores the politics of it. Politics influences social assistance programmes in a two-way process. Politics is crucial to the adoption, design and implementation of social assistance programmes, but the latter also have a feedback effect on local and national politics. A comparative perspective helps identify some key parameters in the politics of social assistance.

The stakes, value, frequency, and costs of corruption have become exceptionally high in modern India. This is partly because some of the tenets of the free-market mechanism are implemented without the necessary underlying institutional conditions for an efficient and fair functioning of the market mechanism. This paper brings forth the relevance of the insights of new institutional economics to the functioning of the Indian economy.

The institutions themselves are many and diverse and they do not remain fixed for ever but evolve over time. The course of their evolution cannot be the same for all nations because each nation has its own distinctive social order. Democracy changes that social order to some extent but it is also changed by it. The institutions of democracy cannot be the same for all nations because the social institutions with which they become intertwined vary enormously from one nation to another.

This was because of the successful growth of industries such as pharmaceuticals which the earlier planning strategy helped to develop. The reforms nevertheless changed the structure of demand in favour of capital goods such as new types of telecom equipment. But they did not help the domestic manufacturing of these goods. Indeed, the underdevelopment of such industries is the main reason why the manufacturing trade deficit has worsened since the early 2000s.

Rice Intensification Practices in 13 States of India||K PALANISAMI, K R KARUNAKARAN, UPALI AMARASINGHE and C R RANGANATHAN||Can the System of Rice Intensification be the answer to meet the country's future rice demand? A macro-level study covering 13 major rice-growing states indicates that fields with SRI have a higher average yield compared to non-SRI fields. Out of the four core SRI components typically recommended, 41% adopted one component, 39% adopted two to three components, and only 20% adopted all the components. Full adopters recorded the highest yield increase (31%), but all adopters had yields higher than those that used conventional practices. They also had higher gross margins and lower production costs compared to non-SRI fields. Though the rice yield of the country can significantly increase under SRI and modified SRI practices, there are major constraints that have to be tackled before this can be achieved.

In a majority of these studies, it is found that subjects tend to cooperate if they are allowed to communicate and make their own rules of use. In the context of the Forest Rights Act, 2006, a number of questions are being raised at public forums. Are communities capable of managing a valuable resource like a forest? Will transfer of authority not result in large-scale deforestation? Are traditional norms of sustainable harvesting still effective even after increased access to markets and commercialisation? This paper reports on the findings of four field experiments that evolved in the course of a study conducted in two indigenous communities in Maharashtra. Both of the communities have had past traditions of shared norms and mutual trust, and their behaviour in the experiments shows that the communities still tend to be non-exploitative, non-commercial, and cooperative for prioritising, planning, and managing resource sustainably.

It is time the central bank accepts once again that one of its main roles is to maintain the flow of credit to the productive sectors.

The international image of the military as a force of untrammelled power within Sri Lanka and the image being constructed within Sri Lanka of the military as capable of winning all battles are both flawed and undermine progressive politics. The need is for serious analysis and a far-reaching debate on militarisation which can enable dissent and contribute towards post-war democratisation.
Vol. 48, No. 7 (FEBRUARY 16, 2013)||insight||India's External Sector: Do We Need to Worry?||C RANGARAJAN and PRACHI MISHRA||The deterioration in India's current account has led to a series of debates in the policy arena relating to sustainability, the importance of exchange rates in influencing the trade balance, and the role of high and rising inflation. Against this background, this article takes a step back and analyses the performance of the external sector in India since 1990. It estimates the sustainable current deficit to GDP ratio to be 2.3%. Importantly, even to sustain a 2.3% CAD, India would need net capital inflows of the order of at least $50-70 billion annually over the next five years. Given the uncertainty around both the push factors (e g, rising global risk aversion) as well as the pull factors (slower growth in India) that determine capital flows, attracting such magnitudes of flows could very well be an uphill task.

Compared with literature, history's relationship with memory appears complicated, primarily because of its institutionalised modernisation. This paper underlines the need to expand the horizons of history by approaching memory more constructively than Indian historians usually do. In India, this means analysing the memory of the majority who remain excluded from academic constructions of knowledge. Several modes of remembering have flourished in the pre-literate, literate and post-literate contexts of Indian society since the early 20th century outside professional history. This paper suggests that written history and unwritten memory must both be used critically by the historian. The historian must begin by interrogating his vocation to examine why history, once a popular discipline, has steadily lost social importance since 1947. This paper favours histories appropriate to present and future Indian conditions; it tries to offer possible solutions to the "problem" of history with reference to Indian conditions.

Without a paradigm shift, especially on the part of banks, financial inclusion is bound to fall short of expectations. It proposes that the banking sector should look at efforts to expand inclusion not as a capital cost or as a charitable expense, but as a long-term investment in the future. The soundness of such an investment is borne out in the success of individual business correspondents in some districts of the state.

This is inevitable since new forces have not consolidated power and learned how to re-establish effective new states. With the economies in a shambles, job creation â€” a major popular demand â€” has had to be put on hold, thereby making an expectant population ever more frustrated and angry.

Has there been a corresponding change in the economy? Using comprehensive data on enterprise ownership from the Economic Census of 1990, 1998 and 2005, this paper shows there are substantial caste differences in entrepreneurship across India. The scheduled castes and scheduled tribes are significantly under-represented in the ownership of enterprises and the share of the workforce employed by them. These differences are widespread across all states, have decreased very modestly between 1990 and 2005, and cannot be attributed to broad differences in access to physical or human capital.

This paper attempts to understand the reasons underlying such dismal performance by focusing on the role of the financing factors in manufacturing. The study argues that liberalisation measures were inimical to competition. This, along with the diminishing role of development finance institutions, risk-averse behaviour of the banks, lacklustre performance of the new issues market, concentration of stock market activity and the minuscule size of the corporate debt market have increased the effective cost of debt. Remedial measures in terms of devising suitable derivate instruments, increasing reliance on the corporate debt market, expanding the reach of the mutual funds industry and better corporate governance and accounting standards are proposed so as to instil buoyancy in the sector.

This paper proposes a new metric, crowding, defined as the number of persons per hectare for a particular urban use. Thus we have indoor crowding, park crowding, and amenity crowding. How the new metric of crowding might be used in planning or replanning urban areas in general and the major policy changes that need to be made if Mumbai's housing shortage is to be seriously addressed is also discussed.

This calorie threshold approach suffers from many problems. An alternative revealed preference-based approach has been provided by Jensen and Miller. In the JM approach, the staple calorie share reveals whether a household is calorie deprived. We use this approach to estimate the extent of poverty in India. Though our poverty estimates are very close to the Tendulkar Committee estimates for the urban sector, for the rural sector our estimates are considerably lower. We also find by our method a remarkable rise in urban poverty between 2004-05 and 2007-08.

While tobacco's ill effects on health are well studied, private expenditure on tobacco remains hidden and neglected. This study shows that personal as well as government efforts towards development have been more than neutralised by the free reign of tobacco in Gadchiroli district, Maharashtra. Since the expenditure on tobacco is likely to result in worsening of poverty in addition to adverse health consequences, the government should strongly consider stricter implementation of the tobacco control policy as an important strategy.

In a medieval war economy the smelter shared a relationship of mutual interdependence with the feudal state as a provider of critical raw material for weapon manufacture. This, however, changed with the advent of the colonial state, interdependence giving way to competition over resources. It is through this multilayered perspective of environmental and military history intertwined with the anthropology of iron smelting that we can unearth one of the roots of statutory forest laws.

The originality of Indian scholarship lies in establishing multilateralism as a temporally and spatially contingent concept, the normative and institutional dimensions of which vary in time and space. Indian scholarship views multilateralism as more regional than universal, more dynamic than static and more normative than institutional.
Vol. 48, No. 5 (FEBRUARY 2, 2013)||special article||Regulating Microfinance Institutions||RENUKA SANE and SUSAN THOMAS||Recent events in India have brought a fresh focus on the appropriate regulatory stance towards microfinance. This paper analyses the puzzles of financial regulation in this field from first principles and argues that mainstream mechanisms of consumer protection and micro-prudential regulation need to be modified. From this perspective, it suggests regulatory strategies that need to be adopted for dealing with microcredit and financial distribution that focus on the poor. This conceptual framework also helps analyse two policy responses, viz, the Malegam Report and the draft Microfinance Bill, 2011.

The state has definitely benefited from the anti-caste movements in the past and the dalits are experiencing upward mobility. The violence is a desperate acknowledgement of the dalit reality and the inability of the intermediate castes to exercise caste power over them as in the past.

Instead of addressing the problems encountered by the present system, policymakers are again attempting to resort to another version of targeted provisioning. By assessing important implications relating to various dimensions of the proposed National Food Security Bill 2011, this article focuses on the issues of financing for ensuring reasonable food security for all in the country.

It aims to read outside the "received frames" and ask the right questions about perceptions, impressions and understandings of a violent act in the state. Even though Kashmir has always lived with violence, the two bomb blasts in Srinagar in July 1988 changed everything. Violence from thereon became an assertion, its forms changing but continuing to hold sway.
Vol. 48, No. 4 (JANUARY 26, 2013)||special article||The Killing Fields of Assam: Myth and Reality of Its Muslim Immigration||VANI KANT BOROOAH||Assam has been in turmoil since the 1970s over the issue of illegal immigration from Bangladesh. This has frequently manifested itself in attacks on the state's Bengali-speaking Muslims who are accused of not only occupying land belonging to the native population but also diluting and debasing the traditional Assamese Hindu culture through the instrument of a foreign language (Bengali) and an alien religion (Islam). Since the issue of immigration into Assam raises several questions like what is the scale of the problem, what is the division of immigrants between Hindu and Muslim, and how many illegal migrants are there in the state, this paper attempts to look for answers by applying community-specific reproduction rates to the Muslim and non-Muslim sections of Assam's population and comparing the derived numbers with the actual number of Muslims and non-Muslims in the state. It also evaluates the contribution of Assam's immigrants to its polity and its economy.

As a colonial power, Britain ruled India primarily for its own benefit; at the same time, it had to address all the usual issues of urban governance, such as control of space, provision of water, sewerage, roads, street lighting and police. Naturally enough, the British often viewed Indian problems through the lens of Britain's experience in its own first era of rapid industrialisation, urbanisation, and popular democracy. India's conditions were, however, quite dissimilar and the immense size and diversity of India produced divergent policies in different regions and at various times. Even where policies may have been similar, their implementation and reception frequently varied. In England, efforts to plan towns effectively lacked sufficient funding and personnel; in India, these shortcomings were far more severe. Nevertheless, British planning bequeathed to India enduring legacies â€” positive and negative â€” in urban architecture, physical planning, and the administrative mechanisms of governance.

The labyrinth of centrally sponsored and assisted schemes and their rising share in the centre's support for the plan through gross budgetary support are important factors. The element of discretion in centre-state transfers and the bypassing of state machinery in the flow of funds add to the complexity in this sphere. This paper deliberates on the recommendations of the Planning Commission's 2011 Chaturvedi Committee on restructuring of centrally sponsored schemes and discusses some of the larger issues that emerge from centralisation of social sector expenditure.

The present clamour for a censored caste history has a right-wing Hindu character to it. If memories of degradation are an enabling resource in producing alliances against continuing forms of oppression, in this instance erasure of such memories is what is being sought by an upwardly mobile caste.

Vol. 48, No. 3 (JANUARY 19, 2013)||special article||Whither Secularism: Is It a Problem of Definition?||RATNA NAIDU||This essay proposes a move away from the "dyad" conceptualisation of the secular and the sacred. The source of contestation against the secular is not only religion but also other institutions in society. The binary conceptualisation of the secular and the sacred derived from the reality of fused institutions of an earlier era is of limited value. It is argued here that the secular is multifocal as is the secular agenda. The enemies of the secular include entrenched interests in the economy and polity which, in today's highly differentiated societies, are not guided exclusively by religion. Further, the conditions that define the secular, namely, the separation of the state from religious authority, neutrality of the state towards all religions, the establishment of a procedural republic, are all "ideal types" to be used as a Weberian research tool, but, collectively, these do not encompass the secular problem in its entirety. In this essay the secular is defined as a value, a preferred way of life rooted in secular philosophy. Secularism is the ideology which motivates action towards implementing secular values. The essay presents the difficulties with the traditional definition of the secular with illustrations from past and current events, and presents an alternate approach.

However, per capita consumption of textiles has increased significantly from the early 1990s. This study analyses the reasons for this increase in demand and the resulting revival of the Indian textile industry by examining whether the determinants of textile demand identified by previous studies aiming to explain the deceleration in the industry are important in the more recent context. The intention is to assess whether movements in the variables that explained the deceleration in demand for textiles since the mid-1960s are relevant for explaining the growth since the early 1990s.

Yet, a close examination of the report suggests a flawed methodology and inexplicable changes in assumptions. As a result, the two primary benefits claimed for the POSCO project â€” employment and revenues to the state â€” seem to be grossly incorrect. The privatisation of base data used in some of the projections not only makes the task of verification arduous, but also puts it beyond the reach of democratic oversight. The issues in applied economic research in this case can be seen as symptomatic of structural problems in neo-liberal policymaking.

There are also other connected issues that require urgent attention including the description of a rape as a "state worse than death", making out certain acts of violence to be rare aberrations when they are depressingly routine, ignoring the sexual violence within families and the need to make the legal system accountable to the female citizenry.

This article makes an attempt to analyse the teachers' manual for class sixth to eighth. The premise of such an evaluation framework is sound but the manual actually goes against its very spirit.

Vol. 48, No. 2 (JANUARY 12, 2013)||special article||Music in the Balance: Language, Modernity and Hindustani Sangeet in Dharwad||TEJASWINI NIRANJANA||The paper examines the social role of Hindustani music in the Dharwad-Hubli region, situating the music's early 20th century emergence and proliferation against and within the debates on language that were central to cultural transformation in that area. What was the problem of Kannada and more broadly the language question in the mid to late 19th and early 20th centuries? What might have been the role of vocal music in negotiating the language conflict? The paper suggests that Hindustani music is part of the cultural labour undertaken in the region during the rise of Kannada "nationalism". The phrase draws attention to the nature of the work involved in cultural practice and performance, and the nature of performers' activity, through teaching, singing, playing, evaluating and arguing about music. Cultural labour references a visible aspect of social transformation and social process, the latter to be seen as marked by elusive shifts in ways of living, thinking and creating. The formation of the taste for Hindustani sangeet in Dharwad is one result of such shifts.

Though the latest method aims to improve upon previous methods, its empirical implications and precise justification are not yet clear. This paper empirically examines the Socio-Economic Caste Census methodology and compares it empirically with alternative proposals to show the choice of a particular methodology matters. It also points out how state-level BPL poverty caps will vary if they reflect multiple deprivations such as malnutrition and housing rather than only expenditure-based poverty rates.
Vol. 48, No. 2 (JANUARY 12, 2013)||special article||Inequality Matters||RADHICKA KAPOOR||If economic growth was the only factor that mattered for poverty reduction, we should have witnessed greater poverty reduction. Also, states with the highest growth rate should have performed the best in terms of poverty reduction. The pace of poverty reduction is influenced both by changes in income distribution over time and by the shape of the initial distribution. This empirical analysis shows that the task of poverty reduction in India is seriously challenged by rising inequality. In addition to the one-shot instant impact on poverty from a pure redistribution effect, improvements in distribution of income have a long-run effect derived from an increase in the growth elasticity of poverty. This gives us a strong case for prioritising distribution and making income distribution more equal before embarking on a high growth path.

Since many of the practices of the Heraka are derived from Hinduism, the Sangh parivar has declared them to be vanvasi (forest-dwellers) and sought to assimilate them into the Hindu fold.

The crisis was widely perceived as an outcome of some of the faulty policies implied by the NCM. This prompted a serious re-examination and criticism of the theoretical foundations of the NCM from four distinct schools of thought, viz, the post-Keynesian, Austrian, Structuralist and Marxist. The dominant critique seems to be the post-Keynesian and most of the revisions in post-crisis macroeconomic policy have also been along these lines. This paper delves into the theoretical structure as well as the policy implications of the post-Keynesian critique of the NCM. Certain implications are drawn for macroeconomic policy and cautionary caveats are entered for the process of financialisation currently under way in several emerging market economies.

However, even though basic individual needs are intrinsic to human nature regardless of historical and social contexts, the issue of defining poverty in a universal manner may be impeded by the network of interrelations that is specific to the social background of poverty. Examining micro-level evidence from two slums in Delhi, this paper explores the differences in practice of different definitions of poverty â€” monetary poverty, primary good deprivation and lack of capabilities â€” to measure the extent of poverty according to each approach. The results show little evidence of a perfect match between the three definitions of poverty.
Vol. 48, No. 1 (JANUARY 5, 2013)||special article||The Material and the Symbolic: Intersectionalities of Home-Based Work in India||SARASWATI RAJU||Capital has an overarching logic of accumulation in general and yet the economic rationale, intercepted by national and local configurations of social power, makes capital unfold differentially in different spaces. The labour market provides an ideal site to interrogate such processes. In India, regional specificities are stark when it comes to the presence of women workers in the public domain, which get significantly obliterated if they are in home-based work. This is because home-based work hinges upon responsibilities of social reproduction and more importantly upon all-pervasive social norms that continue to embed women in traditional constructs of domesticity. It can be argued that in a situation where the market has to become extremely competitive and cost effective, the concept of flexible and cheap labour â€” the bandwagon of expanding capital â€” is best articulated through work that is carried out at homes for it can gel comfortably well, in sync with social codes, that assign women to the confines of home even if their status is that of workers.
