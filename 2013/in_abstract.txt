Agricultural and livelihood vulnerability indices developed showed reduction in vulnerability due to implementation of works under the Act and resulting environmental benefits.
Vol. 48, No. 51 (DECEMBER 21, 2013)||special article||The Nature of Economic Development and the Economic Development of Nature||PARTHA DASGUPTA||This paper reviews and in part extends an emerging literature that integrates development and environmental thinking. It focuses on a small part of the literature: economic evaluation, and goes on to develop the notion of sustainable development and construct a unified language for sustainability and policy analyses. It is shown that by economic growth we should mean growth in wealth - which is the social worth of an economy's entire set of capital assets - not growth in gross domestic product nor the many ad hoc indicators of human development that have been proposed in recent years. The concept of wealth invites us to extend the notion of capital assets and the idea of investment well beyond conventional usage. The author also shows that by sustainable development we should mean development in which wealth (per head) adjusted for its distribution does not decline. This has radical implications for the way national accounts are prepared and interpreted. The author then provides an account of a recent publication that has put the theory to work by studying the composition of wealth accumulation in contemporary India. The study reveals that the entire architecture of contemporary development thinking is stacked against nature. These are still early days in the measurement of the wealth of nations, but both theory and the few empirical studies we now have at our disposal should substantially alter the way we interpret the progress and regress of nations.

Two cases presented in this article demonstrate that activists and experts, even high court judges, cannot change the situation, if the authorities do not want to play ball.
Vol. 48, No. 42 (OCTOBER 19, 2013)||special article||Family Migration in India: 'Push' or 'Pull' or Both or What?||D JAYARAJ||In this paper an attempt has been made to provide an account of family migration which is a relatively under-researched phenomenon, in India. The analysis, while suggesting the importance of factors related to both growth theory ("pull") and Third World urbanisation ("push") versions in explaining family migration, also brings out the importance of evolving a framework that incorporates the complex interplay of social, political, environmental and development-related factors for a more comprehensive understanding of family migration in India and in other parts of the developing world.
Vol. 48, No. 41 (OCTOBER 12, 2013)||commentary||The Case of Sacred Groves in India||ANWESHA BORTHAKUR||Sacred groves have survived very long without human interference, and thus are of anthropological, cultural, economic, and ecological significance. In India, these groves are concentrated in the North-East and along the Western Ghats, both globally recognised hotspots of biodiversity. Unfortunately, their size and number are now shrinking at an alarming rate, and it is high time a workable solution is found to sustain them.
Vol. 48, No. 39 (SEPTEMBER 28, 2013)||commentary||A New China Engages India||ZORAWAR DAULET SINGH||The new China that has emerged in the aftermath of the global financial crisis of 2008 is no longer passive or timid, but sees itself as a big power with a more strategic approach to its external environment. Retracing the ideological contest between reformers and leftists in China on the nature of the post-Maoist system, this article points out that New Delhi has to reassess the type of relationship it wants to build with its stronger and more self-assured northern neighbour.
Vol. 48, No. 36 (SEPTEMBER 7, 2013)||commentary||Keeper of Maharashtra's Conscience||LINA MATHIAS||Narendra Dabholkar (1945-2013) who was shot dead on 20 August not only campaigned relentlessly against the chicanery of unscrupulous godmen but also the ramifications of blind beliefs like the exploitation of women, the ill-treatment of the mentally ill under the guise of exorcism and environmentally unfriendly rituals. He did this by building an excellent network of activists, conscious citizens and progressive writers, theatre and film personalities.
Vol. 48, No. 35 (AUGUST 31, 2013)||consequences of gender imbalance||Marriage Squeeze and Mate Selection: The Ecology of Choice and Implications for Social Policy in China||LISA EKLUND||The marriage squeeze in China, whereby the sex ratio imbalance leaves many males without a marriage partner, is not only about numbers, but also about how the institution of marriage is socially, economically, and politically underpinned. This paper uses the concept of ecology of choice in mate selection to demonstrate how different social processes and practices have ramifications on who can marry, who they can marry, and under what circumstances. It points to the historical and cultural practices of patrilineage, hypergamy, and concubinage, which contributed to a marriage squeeze long before the sex ratio at birth became an issue. It also examines how the policies of the Chinese Communist Party have affected social institutions related to marriage, reinforcing the marriage squeeze, and discusses the implications of this.
Vol. 48, No. 34 (AUGUST 24, 2013)||commentary||A Global Green New Deal for Sustainable Development||JOMO KWAME SUNDARAM||The protracted global economic slowdown and the deep ecological crisis that the world finds itself in both call for a Global Green New Deal, similar to the New Deal of the United States that tackled the Great Depression. The 21st century New Deal must include developing countries and has to be economically, socially and ecologically sustainable.
Vol. 48, No. 32 (AUGUST 10, 2013)||commentary||Restoring Normalcy in Uttarakhand||RAVI CHOPRA||In their anxiety to restore normalcy in Uttarakhand, both the central and state governments are refusing to face the real reasons behind the devastation caused after the recent floods. These include misplaced development priorities that ignored the ecological fragility of the region. To reduce the possibility of such disasters repeating themselves, the entire Himalayan region needs to adopt a different developmental model that is sensitive to the environment and the survival needs of its people.
Vol. 48, No. 30 (JULY 27, 2013)||commentary||India and the Challenge of the Melting Arctic||B K SIDHU||The recent acceptance of India's bid for an "observer" status in the Arctic Council has brought many issues to the fore, including India's position and role vis-à-vis the geopolitics of this ecologically fragile region. India needs to develop a long-term resource strategy coupled with the quest for scientific knowledge in the Arctic.
Vol. 48, No. 30 (JULY 27, 2013)||special article||Development and Ecological Sustainability in India: Possibilities for the Post-2015 Framework||ASHISH KOTHARI||This paper is aimed at policy-level discussions, as well as an aid to civil society to push for necessary changes to take Indian economy, society and polity towards the goal of human well-being with ecological sustainability as one fulcrum. A possible post-2015 framework of implementation of the Millennium Development Goals that combines sustainability and human well-being that could be applied globally, including its key principles, is attempted at here.
Vol. 48, No. 29 (JULY 20, 2013)||commentary||Hydropower Projects in Uttarakhand: Displacing People and Destroying Lives||RAKESH AGRAWAL||There has been an unthoughtout rush to build hydroelectric power projects in Uttarakhand without assessing the ecological, social or economic costs of their implementation. the government is not even sure of how many projects are planned and of what capacity. Written well before the recent destructive floods hit the state, this article shows the extent and nature of the developmentalist disease which has afflicted our planners and policymakers. It will provide some background to the debates on the link between the damage to the environment and the destruction caused by the floods.

Although the finance minister claims that this growth will be sustainable and equitable, this article argues that the development route proposed in the budget and the current pattern of economic development clash with the requirements of ecological sustainability and wildlife conservation.
Vol. 48, No. 15 (APRIL 13, 2013)||commentary||Nuclear Power at What Cost?||MANU V MATHAI||The environmental movement, as it increasingly grapples with the ecological impossibilities posed by the commitment to open-ended economic growth, needs to move beyond its general silence in matters of realpolitik and engage more concretely in that sphere. The ongoing contests in India over the future of nuclear power — seen in Jaitapur and Koodankulam — are part of a fight over two broad visions of the future.
Vol. 48, No. 15 (APRIL 13, 2013)||special article||Social Ecology of Domestic Water Use in Bangalore||VISHAL K MEHTA, RIMI GOSWAMI, ERIC KEMP-BENEDICT, SEKHAR MUDDU and DEEPAK MALGHAN||The rapid growth of urban India has added new saliency to the resource conflict between the burgeoning cities and village India that continues to be the home for vast majority of Indians. Cities, like living organisms, depend on external metabolic flows to keep them alive. Among all the metabolic flows of matter and energy none is more important than water — especially water used for meeting basic drinking water and other domestic consumption needs. This paper develops a metabolic framework for domestic water use in Bangalore, one of the fastest growing urban agglomerations in India. Our urban metabolism framework treats the city as a tightly-coupled social-ecological system and shows that a spatially explicit understanding of consumption patterns is crucial to addressing three central aspects of the water conundrum — equity, ecological sustainability and economic efficiency.
Vol. 48, No. 13 (MARCH 30, 2013)||review of urban affairs||Urban Multiplicities: Governing India's Megacities||ASHIMA SOOD||A recent two-day international workshop on the "Governance of Megacity Regions in India" in Mumbai revealed the multiple conceptions and contestations that drive metropolitan growth in India and around the world. Though cities globally face similar competitive pressures in an era of footloose capital flows, there were few readymade models of metropolitan governance on offer. Instead the international experience suggests that democratic processes matter as much as getting institutions right. Although questions of sustainability and resilience remained an intriguing but underexplored theme in the workshop, the increasing urgency of environmental governance agendas for India's megacity regions emerged as a key area for future research and policy.
Vol. 48, No. 5 (FEBRUARY 2, 2013)||special article||Unearthing the Roots of Colonial Forest Laws: Iron Smelting and the State in Pre- and Early-Colonial India||SASHI SIVRAMKRISHNA and AMALENDU JYOTISHI||This paper repositions iron smelting and the smelter at the centre of a revised narrative of pre- and early-colonial forest history and policy. In a medieval war economy the smelter shared a relationship of mutual interdependence with the feudal state as a provider of critical raw material for weapon manufacture. This, however, changed with the advent of the colonial state, interdependence giving way to competition over resources. It is through this multilayered perspective of environmental and military history intertwined with the anthropology of iron smelting that we can unearth one of the roots of statutory forest laws.
