The role of knowledge in contemporary education needs in-depth examination and debate to usher in a system that includes all those who are now marginalised.

It argues that the public food supply chain for market intervention has a favourable impact on the cost-benefit ratio, poverty reduction, calorie consumption by the poor and productivity-led agricultural growth. The paper proposes reforms for the six pillars of the public food supply chain. These include: an alternative poverty line concept that is linked to the minimum "norms" for calorie intake enabling a reduction of the exclusion and inclusion errors, procurementjustforthe PDsand buffer stocks to be purchased at a farm price that is fully cost-based, fair price shops with fixed and adequate time of operations; "indent" of the demand, doorstep delivery, and so on.

Theoretically, futures are expected to aid price discovery and risk mitigation. But empirical analysis shows that speculators drive the markets and, by virtue of their domination, abduct the price discovery process in certain commodities. The deceptive price discovery leads to suboptimal forecast of future prices. So futures markets fail to offer an effective hedge against price risk. In addition, the current public-private partnership regulation is a deterrent to the sustainable growth of futures markets.

The state government provides free electricity for agriculture and a high minimum support price and yet recommends a shift away from rice to curb groundwater depletion. This paper analyses the trends and turning points in irrigation development in the state, its shifts in cropping pattern, and trends in electricity consumption. It further examines the real-world feasibility of the long-pending recommendation to shift the cropping pattern from water-intensive rice and wheat to less water-intensive maize and wheat.

The tendency of low-productivity states to catch up with high-productivity states is studied through the unconditional β-convergence approach, and the operation of Galton's fallacy through growth-terminal productivity-level regressions. The diminution of variance in productivity levels is tested using the σ-convergence approach and the robustness of the results is tested using alternative test statistics. The results reveal that states are converging in terms of land productivity, but not in terms of labour productivity.

However, the pace of growth of this industry has shown a remarkable upswing only after 1991, and particularly after 2005. The introduction of pharmaceutical product patents brought new business opportunities. But the increase in competitive pressure has possibly induced the exit of small and inefficient firms and plants from the market. Against this backdrop, it is necessary to assess the performance of the pharmaceutical industry and find the factors responsible for the variation in industry efficiency and productivity. In this paper, stochastic frontier analysis has been used to estimate the efficiencies of plants using unit-level panel data (2000-05). An analysis of the forces of variation in the efficiencies and productivities of these industrial units has been conducted. Plants with low efficiencies have not survived – they have either merged with other plants or been compelled to discontinue their operations. Managerial skill and wage rates have had a significant positive effect on the performance of these plants. Some of the newly identified areas, with special facilities, are conducive to better performance.

These investments have been triggered by market reform, investment subsidies, and better overall public service provision and governance. Almost all potato farmers, small and large, participate in cold storage and the availability of cold storages is associated with improved efficiency in value chains because of lower wastages even as a number of these cold storages have become involved in input, output, and especially credit markets. The increasing availability of modern cold storages has therefore led to important changes in potato value chains, with significant implications for smallholders.

This article examines whether mining in Goa meets Hartwick's rule, and finds that the state government captures only a small fraction of the value of the iron ore extracted from mines it has leased out. It also finds that most of the value of the iron ore is cornered by mining leaseholders, resulting in a significant redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich. It points to national and sub-national entities that follow Hartwick's rule, and says there are many best practices that can be easily adopted by India.

Using National Sample Survey data it follows the change in the hierarchy of participation within a binary probit framework over the years. Since being eligible for higher education is found to be the key factor in participation, it also explores the role of supply-side constraints by controlling for the distance to a secondary school. Econometric estimations for rural and urban areas indicate a vast rural-urban divide in the role of socio-religious affiliations. Eligibility seems to be the key factor in participation, and a better understanding of the constraints on school education is critical if participation in higher education is to be increased.

Evidence from Longitudinal Research in Andhra Pradesh||D D KAROPADY||Internationally, considerable research has been carried out on the subject of school choice or school vouchers. Recent evidence in other countries is mixed but increasingly pointing towards school choice not adding value in terms of curricular learning achievement. This paper presents findings from a large-scale five-year longitudinal research based on the randomised control trial methodology that was conducted in Andhra Pradesh. It finds that private schools add no value to children in terms of learning outcomes as compared to government schools. Children shifting to private schools under a scholarship programme perform no better than their government school counterparts even after five years of private schooling.

A Political Economy Reading of India's Growth Experience, 1993-2013||KUNAL SEN and SABYASACHI KAR||India's post-reform growth experience can be separated into three distinct growth episodes. The first growth episode was from 1993 to 2002 and was characterised by a set of predictable informal relationships ("ordered deals") between political and economic elites, which were relatively open as well. The second episode was from 2002 to 2010, and deals in this period became increasingly closed, leading to negative feedback effects along with structural retrogression of the economy. The third episode, beginning in 2011, was one of an incipient growth deceleration, and was characterised by increasingly disordered deals. This paper argues that this deceleration is the outcome of two separate phenomena: (1) increasing political delegitimation of the growth process that was seen as highly predatory and corruption-intensive; and (2) the pushback from accountability institutions in the post-2010 period. For growth to return, more than economic reforms or infrastructure spending, it is necessary for a realignment of the relationships between political and economic elites and between elites and non-elites such that there is a return to "open ordered deals".

Energy as a resource and electricity as an amenity are no exceptions. In this context, this paper questions the relevance of promoting solar photovoltaic systems for lighting in rural areas. It asserts that the basic electricity needs of rural areas are no different from urban ones, and there is a willingness to pay for reliable supply of electricity. Studies show that solar PV's failure in villages is primarily due to glitches in maintenance, arising from lack of money, materials, and skilled humanpower. The answer would be to give these systems an urban focus, bringing in a more balanced use of solar energy for electrification.

Leadership, measured in terms of export shares, appears to have moved from the United States, United Kingdom and Germany to Ireland and then to India. India has been trying to maintain her leadership through improvements in technological capability and in the process has also become a base for multinationals to set up operations. These multinationals have been increasing their innovative activities in India as revealed through increased patenting, and domestic Indian enterprises have followed, although very slowly, in improving their technological capability. Two conclusions can be drawn. Leadership in CIS is basically a function of the availability of highly trained software engineers. But the sustainability of leadership depends on whether the industry is domestic or foreign owned.

This paper finds a structural break in the post-reform period corresponding to the introduction of LAF in 2000. Using Vector Auto Regression techniques on monthly data from April 1993 to March 2012, the paper also assesses the changing importance of various transmission channels of monetary policy in the pre-LAF and post-LAF periods. It is found that the bank lending channel remains an important means of transmission of monetary policy in India, but it has weakened in the post-LAF period. The interest rate and asset price channels have become stronger and the exchange rate channel, although weak, shows a mild improvement in the post-LAF period.

They have also failed to address the problem of lack of facilities for women and differently-abled people. With the Swacch Bharat Mission, the way forward must involve a careful rethinking of public toilet governance, including revision of planning norms, providing statutory backing to these norms, and creating effective regulatory institutions. This is essential to alleviate the intensifying everyday contestations between those who desire a "clean city" and those who are forced to defecate in the open.

Real estate, infrastructure, tourism, and urban beautification plans are putting unprecedented pressure on the coastal commons. Fisherfolk, whose everyday life and survival is rooted in the commons, are at the centre of these processes of coastal urbanisation. Faced with the prospect of losing access to these spaces, fisherfolk are drawing upon their customary knowledge and new satellite mapping techniques to assert their rights to land and livelihoods.

Urban growth boundaries the world over are typically known to drive land prices higher in the inner city area by artificially limiting the supply of land. Bengaluru has witnessed significant increases in land prices over the last decade. This paper examines whether the green belt in Bengaluru has had a significant effect on land prices through an analysis of price differentials inside and outside the growth boundaries. It also debates the relevance of a green belt as an urban containment tool in regimes characterised by ineffective provision of infrastructure and lax implementation of zoning regulations.

This paper presents findings from case studies of two transport infrastructure projects in Dehradun city to demonstrate that the reasons for the unexpected outcomes were of a more complex nature. Instead of local governments, all proposals were drawn up by consultants operating under unrealistic deadlines. Project proposals were prepared with an excessive focus on target expenditure and infrastructure creation. The paper emphasises that implementing such programmes requires an effective institutional design that bridges the gap between local governments in small cities and grant-making agencies at higher levels.

This article examines the town's uneven spatial and economic development by focusing on the fishing and tourism sectors, highlighting the historically generated and socially produced contradictions and contestations within and between them. It argues that the very instruments of spatial planning meant to address uneven development end up reinforcing and exacerbating existing spatio-social and political inequalities. It goes on to trace the processes by which spatial planning becomes an arena where regulations are bent and flouted by directly influencing local and state-level actors through a negotiated approach to planning.

Microfinance institutions have increasingly focused on financial performance and have neglected their declared social mission of poverty reduction and empowerment. Loan officers in the field are under enormous pressure to achieve individual financial targets and now routinely mistreat clients, especially poor women. The values of neo-liberal mainstream finance in the rich world have spread to microcredit in the villages of Bangladesh and India. This situation is hidden from western publics who are fed the lie of "the magic of microfinance" by their media, guided by the needs and interests of mainstream finance seeking to provide some "good news" about the financial sector as scandal after scandal unfold. Urgent action is needed, particularly from the leaders of the microfinance industry, to refocus their organisations and workforce on achieving both financial and social performance targets.

State Climate Change Planning in India||NAVROZ K DUBASH and ANU JOGESH||In 2009, the Government of India requested states to develop State Action Plans on Climate Change. Based on a detailed analysis of five state climate plans, this article finds that climate plans provide an important institutional platform to mainstream concerns of environmental sustainability into development planning but fail to update ideas of sustainability to include climate resilience. There are shortcomings in approach, process, formulation of outcomes, and implementation efforts. These shortcomings are united by a common thread – a tendency to prematurely view state climate plans as vehicles for generating implementable actions rather than an opportunity to redirect development towards climate resilience. However, if state plans are viewed as the beginning of a complex process of updating sustainable development planning rather than as an end in themselves, they provide a foundation upon which climate concerns can be more effectively mainstreamed in local development planning.

Eliminating existing forensic biases to rape and the neglect of healthcare needs of survivors, the model uses gender-sensitive protocol for medico-legal documentation of sexual violence, which focuses on informed consent, documentation of the nature of sexual violence, and collection of relevant forensic evidence. It uses standard treatment guidelines for the provision of treatment, and ensures psychosocial support to the survivor. The results indicate that a sensitive response by health professionals can play a crucial role in healing from sexual abuse.

Aided by infighting in the Congress and the ineptness of the Indian National Lok Dal, the BJP's strategy was to sell the benefit of having the same party in power at the centre and in the state. Barring Jat-dominated west Haryana, the Narendra Modi factor and a social coalition of brahmins, other upper castes and dalits saw it win support in all regions, especially in urban constituencies and among educated and upper-class voters. Yet, it is still early days, and the Congress could prove worrisome if the BJP does not make good on its promises.

The National Family Health Survey 2006 showed that the prevalence of violence is much higher against women belonging to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes as compared to women outside these categories. This article is based on fieldwork done in parts of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Among the causes for domestic violence against dalit women were male alcoholism, the man's suspicious nature, dowry demands, husband's extramarital relations and the complex social situations related to inter-caste marriages. Dalit and tribal women, thus, end up facing caste discrimination and harassment outside the home and domestic violence inside.

In the process we have lost out on something that is rather important, teaching our children that our imaginations and our energies have to be harnessed to the cause of the oppressed all over the world, that closed-in societies lead to stagnation if not to certain death, and that societies that turn their back on Nehru's radical cosmopolitanism circumscribe imaginings and truncate visions of their members.

Vol. 49, No. 47 (NOVEMBER 22, 2014)||special article||Masculine Spaces: Rural Male Culture in North India||PREM CHOWDHRY||In rural north India, there are thriving and exclusive all-male spaces in the villages which play an important role in constructing gender identities. These extend from the home to the public domain. Reserved and used almost exclusively by the male population, these are spaces where the power and legitimacy of masculinity are displayed and cemented and where men are at a distinct advantage in terms of deployment of power. Masculinisation of space means an access to and control over resources of various kinds – material, sociocultural, political and ideological. Signifying both the symbolic and the material dimension of male power, these spaces validate men's control at home, in the village, community, and wider society while asserting the caste and class hierarchies which are under attack in post-Independence India. Circulating ideals of gendered separateness, they make the presence of males and the absence of females seem "natural". This masculinisation of spaces goes totally unacknowledged and unchallenged even by those most affected. It has merited little comment, discussion or condemnation from any quarter.

It presents the rationale for the approach and demonstrates its use, based on a primary household survey carried out at the district level. Discussing the strengths and limitations of the approach, it points to how these measures could be further refined. The effort is to find a method of measurement that will apply to any of the alternative ways of progressing towards universal health coverage, however defined and implemented.

The contention in this note is that apart from some changes in matters of detail, the analytical basis of the identification methodology proposed in the report displays an essential (and unfortunate) loyalty to the flawed methodology advanced in the reports of its distinguished predecessor committees and expert groups. This is a particular pity, in view of (a) the critiques of extant procedures which are numerously available in the literature; (b) the fundamental importance of the problem of poverty in our society; and (c) the fact of yet another missed opportunity to lend some useful direction to the assessment of money-metric deprivation in India.

Often the debate is couched in terms of anti-trafficking lobbying/campaigns. The debate needs to be framed differently. Equating trafficking with sex work does a great disservice to both sex workers and to anti-trafficking campaigns, and only ends up infantilising women. The most powerful weapon to deny sex work the status of work is that of stigma. Stigmatising sex work has ensured keeping sex workers out of the legitimate political space and sections of the left and the women's movement seem to have acquiesced in that.

This article points out that contrary to popular perception, Odisha gradually improved its relative economic position in the second half of the post-reform period. This is evident both in terms of per capita income and key socio-economic indicators. A household survey undertaken to assess the situation at the grass-roots level also corroborates this. An analysis of the information from the survey also suggests that good irrigation facilities, road connectivity, and proximity to vibrant economic activities, such as mining and industry, facilitate more earning and a better standard of living.

This paper suggests an alternative method of inflation control which uses transfer payments to the working population to bring down the rate of inflation by increasing aggregate output. Indeed, real wages and employment go up and post-tax profits do not suffer, even as the government balances its budget by taxing the capitalists to obtain the additional revenue to make the transfer payments. The method however requires capital controls to be in place.

The killing of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old African American, by a white police officer in St Louis is symptomatic of this malaise afflicting American society.

Our very conception of victims and victimhood is based on this hopeful axiom. But not all wounds heal, some remain in a constant state of decay, degenerate, and ultimately risk turning into waste too. It is this possibility of waste that this article explores. The 1984 violence is one of those historical wounds that has neither faded from public memory nor fully healed. At the heart of this unhealing wound is the question of justice that has long been denied to the victims. The judicial affidavits prepared in early 1985 not only narrate the violence that unfolded systematically, but three decades later testify to the inability of the state apparatus to help heal its wounded citizens.

This article will address these assumptions by investigating the evolution of women's activism in a conflict-ridden district of Assam, where "mothers" have appeared on the political stage. It asks what the new appeal to "motherhood" actually means, and whether "motherhood" is a vehicle for women's empowerment. How do the "mothers", as political activists, relate to conventional gender roles; how do they interact with previous generations of women's organisations; and how do they relate to other political actors?

History has left behind social tension, masculinisation lumpenisation of society and crimes against vulnerable groups. Among the last, women are primary victims and crimes against them are on the rise. Even the gender-neutral left government in Tripura has consistently enforced draconian measures. These forgotten and lost stories of violence need to be brought to wider attention.

Even as these former combatants cope with the messy politics of disengaging from the outfit that continues to patronise them, it does not always redress their needs and grievances in post-conflict rehabilitation. This article examines the former rebel's possible foray into peace-making and the legal/juridical and social impasses in the matter of her rehabilitation and reintegration into civil life. It also exposes the shrinking democratic space available to these former rebels who negotiate the tricky path beyond conflict.

When communal animosity spreads across society, it corrodes the social conscience and (directly or subliminally) produces a genocidal consensus. In the aftermath of 1984 we also witnessed the decay of a reliable criminal justice system,the effects of which are still unfolding. It is time for us to see beyond parties, and pay attention to the functions of communal ideology. The reality today is that extremism is a mainstream phenomenon.

Almost 50% of BPL households were found to be non-poor and only 30% of them were aware about RSBY. More importantly, the effect of rsby on catastrophic health expenditure was not found to be statistically significant. Since commercial insurance companies and their third party administrators have limited interest in awareness generation and enrolment, their role may be reviewed and instead an independent public agency should be given responsibility for enrolment of unorganised sector workers. This would be a key step towards achieving universal population coverage. However, in the long run, the government should strengthen the resource-starved public health system.

These reactions have raised fundamental questions about the provision of elementary education as a public good and the role of the State in it. In this article an attempt is made to do a historical review of elementary education policies, placing them in the context of the constitutional objective of "equality of opportunity" and the fundamental right to education now guaranteed through the 86th amendment operationalised in the Act. The policies are reviewed with the lens of inclusion, as that has been, and continues to be, perhaps the most challenging issue in the education sector, even today. To what extent have the government's policies, and their modes of implementation, addressed the concerns and constraints faced by children from marginalised and excluded families in accessing their right to education as equal citizens? What are the implications for the future role of the State in the provision of basic education?

The Indian Army plunged into rescue work, and did a creditworthy job, though it is debatable whether its efforts matched the high praise the media showered on it. It was the local people who helped themselves and their neighbours when outside assistance was slow in coming, and they were undoubtedly the heroes in this cataclysm, which was worsened by a history of neglect and an unresolved conflict.

It draws upon local histories of these two places which trace the intertwined histories of land, politics, domestic life, and work since the early-mid-20th century. The slum emerged as individuals from different communities and faiths collected there and set up homes and families but did not automatically generate social bonds that transcended individual interests. In sharp contrast, in the fishing hamlet, contrary to the widespread belief that collective empowerment of the poor, civil and political, requires a breaking down of caste-community identities, the resistance to exploitation and dispossession was and is rooted in invocations of the "community" even as several fisher castes organised around the worker identity.

Through a detailed analysis of the history of medical jurisprudence textbooks and their use in case law, this paper argues that these textbooks undermine legal reforms in India. It establishes that medical manuals promote the collection of prejudicial and legally irrelevant evidence and reinforce the notion that Indian women frequently bring false charges of rape. Courts regularly cite these textbooks as authority in rape cases, based on the perceived objectivity of medical science as a form of evidence. For legal reforms to be effective, this article argues that changes must be made to textbooks of medical jurisprudence, medical syllabi, and to protocols of medical examination and assessment of rape victims. Further, courts must be more critical in their use and acceptance of these medical manuals.

However, they mostly compare Arthashastra with the works of Western scholars who are sympathetic to the notion of "realpolitik", thereby permanently locating Arthashastra within the confines of Political Realism. This article aims at situating Kautilya on a broader intellectual plane that moves beyond the realpolitik. In order to do so, the article maps the overlap between Arthashastra and a contemporary academic stream in IR — Social Constructivism. It concludes that "eclecticism" or the combination of ideas from a diverse range of sources is an innovative methodology to display the contemporary relevance of Arthashastra.

Second, focusing on the writings of S N Balagangadhara, it explores how a narrative of Hindu hurt emerges. Third, it explores how Wendy Doniger's understanding of Hinduism is organised quite differently – around disciplinary history's concept of context.

The BJP's success was made possible, among other factors, due to its electoral strategy of reinventing social engineering in what may be termed as its second transformation. As a result, it secured significant support among the Other Backward Classes as well as scheduled caste and scheduled tribe voters to gain a winning edge. Besides this, its promise of development and the projection of Modi as a strong and decisive leader attracted support among the lower and middle classes. This will have far-reaching implications to the structure of party competition in the coming years and shape the post-Congress polity. However, enthusiastic over-readings of the mandate would pose a challenge to the BJP even as it searches for ways to entrench itself as a dominant national party in India.

We argue that the BJP built this coalition, in addition to energising its traditional base of social conservatives, by mobilising voters who favour less state intervention in the economy. Narendra Modi's anointment as the BJP's prime ministerial candidate aided this strategy, as Modi is widely perceived to be a socially conservative, pro-market leader. The sclerotic performance of the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government over the past few years compounded the BJP's own efforts. Though the BJP's support base remains Hindu, upper caste, and Hindi-speaking, these other two factors helped the BJP break the social and geographical barriers necessary to secure an outright Lok Sabha majority.

Most social sections had deserted the party (barring the Muslims) as its long-term decline from being India's grand old party was evident in these elections. The lack of adequate leadership and confusion in its ranks played an important role, but there were other systemic reasons for the Congress's defeat.

To explain this variation, it makes a distinction between regionally-located parties and regionalist parties. While both are regional parties in the sense that they have territorially limited arenas of operation they are different in terms of their programme and agenda. In the 2014 elections, the regionally-located parties fared relatively poorly compared to regionalist parties. This paper argues that success and failure often depend on the efforts, strategies and tactics of competitors. It concludes that the strategy of the Bharatiya Janata Party was favourable to the electoral fortunes of regionalist parties and disadvantageous to the regionally-located parties.

Apart from purely numerical effects, the middle class is electorally more impactful relative to its size because of its human capital and opinion-shaping character. The pro-BJP swing among the middle classes, indicated by the Lokniti post-poll survey, cannot be attributed to an anti-minority shift in middle-class opinion nationally, nor to simple economic dissatisfaction, or to a broader attitudinal shift towards economic liberalisation; we have to search for more complex explanations.

The response of the electorate provided important indications of the effect of leadership on the outcome of elections in India. The effect of the leadership issue needs to be viewed in the context of a United Progressive Alliance government that was on the defensive and a Congress leadership that looked ineffective and directionless. These added weight to the BJP's projection of Narendra Modi as a decisive, effective and experienced leader.

First, in the last two decades, Indian electorates have been more exposed to the media than ever before. Second, in the 2014 elections, electorates with higher media exposure were more likely to vote for the Bharatiya Janata Party. Third, voters with higher media exposure were more likely to vote for the BJP in previous Lok Sabha elections as well, and, in that sense, the 2014 elections were no different. Fourth, media exposure influenced the political preferences of people. It also finds that electorates with higher media exposure were more likely to support economic liberalisation, but that it made no difference on social conservatism.

While the 71 seats won in UP significantly contributed to the BJP securing a majority in the Lok Sabha on its own, it is significant that the party made electoral gains across all castes and communities and across all regions in the state. This victory signalled a paradigm shift in voter behaviour, with a preference for good governance and development pushing out the identity politics of caste and community.

With the example of Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh in the 2014 general elections, and using an innovative booth-level ecological inference model, we show that Muslims might indeed vote en bloc for or against certain parties, but they tend to do so in a much more localised way than previously assumed. While public Muslim support for the Bharatiya Janata Party did not translate into electoral support in most places, there are important exceptions to this trend – and at least in the case of Uttar Pradesh, their support for competing parties followed a fairly complex spatial pattern. We further explore this spatial variation in Muslim vote pattern by looking at the moderating impact of minority concentration, violent communal history, and ethnic coordination and conclude with a call for more disaggregated research.

Further, the rate of technical progress in an underdeveloped economy is not exogenous but varies directly with the share of domestic production geared towards exports (or the rate of growth of exports). Exports, through the demand generated by more discerning users/consumers in high-income economies, induce domestic producers into embodying new technologies in machines of a later vintage.

An important departure in the Rangarajan method is to compute the poverty line commodity basket by combining items from two fractile groups to address the relatively higher expenses for some essential non-food items. This, while being statistically plausible, poses a behavioural dilemma, as there will be no fractile group that will satisfy both. As an alternative, we suggest dual poverty lines where the first is computed on the basis of average calorie, protein and fat requirements which are region- and state-specific and the second uses the combined median fractile group after adjusting the distribution with price differentials.

We present evidence from new survey data collected in Bihar, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. Many survey respondents' behaviour reveals a preference for open defecation: over 40% of households with a working latrine have at least one member who defecates in the open. Our data predict that if the government were to build a latrine for every rural household that lacks one, without changing sanitation preferences, most people in our sample in these states would nevertheless defecate in the open. Policymakers in India must lead a large-scale campaign to promote latrine use.

This study on India shows that competitiveness is more likely to be achieved with the presence of foreign firms rather than by simple purchase of foreign technology. Absorptive capacity of firms and institutional factors (namely, competition in the industry) induce competitiveness among firms. It is seen that both the degree of competition and the absorptive capacity of firms have strong effects on indirect benefits from FDI in enhancing competitiveness.

The quotas have imposed a debate on issues of social integration and equity in education that private actors had by and large escaped so far. However, the idea of an egalitarian education system with equality of opportunity as its primary goal appears to be outside the well-meaning space that private school principals inhabit. Therefore, the imposition of the quotas has led to resistance, sometimes justified. But the essential arguments against it are based on the logic of markets that the leadership in private schools has imbibed. This leads them to not only resist the idea of integration, but also devalue the enormous effort put in by children and parents from the weaker sections.

A clearer understanding of the issues in agriculture vs the issues in trade facilitation would enable a better appreciation of what is at stake.
Vol. 49, No. 36 (SEPTEMBER 6, 2014)||commentary||U R Ananthamurthy: Writer, Iconoclast, Public Intellectual||M S PRABHAKARA||U R Ananthamurthy (1932-2014) was the quintessential public intellectual, combative on matters of public interest and unafraid to run counter to popular opinion and prejudices. He won the admiration of many and the hatred of regressive forces and one suspects the latter would have pleased him. His most lasting legacy was in focusing public attention on the perils of political Hindutva.

Even as the bacteria mutates and there is urgent need to deal with the many inadequacies of the present treatment regimen, new drugs backed by innovative research are conspicuously absent. A new candidate anti-TB drug proposed to be tried by the Open Source Drug Discovery initiative with the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research offers a ray of hope.
Vol. 49, No. 36 (SEPTEMBER 6, 2014)||special article||Migration and Precariousness: Two Sides of the Contract Labour Coin||ANIBEL FERUS-COMELO||This study seeks to contribute to a better understanding of precarious employment, highlighting its association with migration through the prism of the private security industry in Goa. In light of rising social anxiety about poor, disenfranchised migrants in India, this article explores the political-economic conditions that give rise to their precarious employment, highlighting the prevalent practice of subcontracting and the associated lax regulation, which render workers vulnerable to exploitation. The research illustrates the power that the state wields, not only in regulation and law enforcement, but also as a principal employer. It concludes with recommendations for policy and action that can lead to greater protection of workers in precarious employment.

This paper spans his lifetime of work, from his involvement with the Master Plan in the Nehruvian period, to being the Delhi Development Authority chairperson during the Emergency, and to the politics behind the creation of Qila Rai Pithora in the post-liberalisation phase, which helps to understand the planner as well as the relationship between urban planning and the shifting poles of political economy and accumulation.
Vol. 49, No. 36 (SEPTEMBER 6, 2014)||special article||The Conservation Question: Inspired by the Kāṇi Tribes of Southern Western Ghats||P MADHU, HARSHA OOMMEN and SHYNU V C||In this paper the idea of conservation is revisited through capturing the erstwhile pre-capitalist lifeworld of the Kāṇis of Shenduruney and Agastiya Malai regions of the southern Western Ghats within Kerala. The essence of conservation is traced through ecosophical meditations of Uexküll, Heidegger, Merleau-Ponty, Deleuze and Guattari. We open up the thinking on conservation towards enhancement of ecology and propose minority politics which may de-singularise the ego-logical schizophrenia towards re-territorialisation of the eco-logical assemblage of human incorporeality.

It has proven to be an effective method of putting social pressure on defaulting borrowers. However, it is argued that the act of publishing details and photographs of borrowers in public fora is not only extrajudicial, but that it fundamentally violates the rights of borrowers.

Tax-funded insurance for poor families is the method chosen for attaining this objective. The Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana was rolled out in 2008 for households below the poverty line, enabling them to access health services in the public and private sectors. However, experience from different countries shows tax-funded insurance systems work well only in settings where public provisioning of healthcare services prevails. State-funded targeted insurance schemes do not seriously mitigate inequitable access to health services in a fundamentally private healthcare delivery market.

Exploring alternative facets and formulations of children's rights though has yet to find space in policy discourse.

They play an important role in the urban transport system and are a significant provider of employment. However, despite their proliferation, they remain unregulated and this has become the subject of loud and often antagonistic debate in the media and considerable confusion amongst the judiciary, transport department and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways. This article attempts to explain the conundrum behind this regulatory confusion and discusses the attitudes of battery rickshaw drivers to regulation.

The immediate background to the 2014 elections and the making of the nexus between the capitalist classes and Modi's BJP is recounted. The essay also looks at the extent and limits of Modi's electoral achievement and concludes with reflections on the possibilities of resistance.

This article analyses the government's share of financial resources for health across different agents, with particular focus on resources for health coverage. An attempt is made to separate spending for health in general and health coverage in particular, and to examine the issue of equity. The analysis indicates that the present health coverage system is inadequate and iniquitous, with various systems running at different costs. It suggests consolidating finances and moving towards a more unified system to realise the benefits of efficiency gains.
Vol. 49, No. 35 (AUGUST 30, 2014)||special article||Measuring Well-being and Accounting Prices of Environmental Resources||M N MURTY||Along the non-optimal sustainable developmental paths of the economy, the choice between benefitbased or cost-based accounting prices for measuring wealth assumes importance from the point of empirical feasibility and tractability. In the context of depletion of environmental resource stocks in the development process, compensatory afforestation of one hectare of forestland or reduction of a tonne of particulate matter emission at margin could be regarded as marginal investment projects. The account price of the resource could be either the present value of costs or the present value of benefits of this marginal investment project. The presence of irreversibility in resource use could be a problem in using cost-based accounting prices. Therefore, an empirically feasible method of measuring wealth of a nation could be to use the cost-based accounting price in general and the benefit-based measure in the special cases where irreversibility is present.

The article provides empirical evidence from India that suggests that the ICP practice of providing economy-wide PPPs that treat all countries (large and small) as single entities severely limits its usefulness. It also provides evidence that questions the usefulness of multilaterally determined PPPs in the context of bilateral comparisons between countries far removed from the numeraire country, namely, the United States. This note also argues that the lack of price information that is relevant for the poor severely limits the usefulness of the ICP PPPs in the poverty comparisons. Some suggestions are provided for improving the relevance and usefulness of the ICP.

This article points out that the Order leaves out much that should have been included, while including much that should have been left out. Its provisions have made the playing field more uneven, with multiple ceiling prices, which is very unfair to consumers already dealing with an irrationally priced market.

India's planners have focused too much on gross domestic product growth and too little on how it has not translated into more jobs. With the largest population of young persons in the world, merely providing youth with skills will not be sufficient. More urgent attention is required to promote the growth of enterprises, especially smaller ones that provide more employment. An understanding of the real constraints on growth of enterprises and a rapid resolution of them requires a collaborative approach between employers, employees and other stakeholders.
Vol. 49, No. 34 (AUGUST 23, 2014)||special article||On Capital, Not-Capital, and Development: After Kalyan Sanyal||VINAY GIDWANI and JOEL WAINWRIGHT||The late Kalyan Sanyal's masterwork, Rethinking Capitalist Development, offers a profound meditation on the essence of contemporary capitalism in India. This review essay summarises the book's most novel qualities and then subjects Sanyal's arguments to a formal critique. It concludes that Rethinking Capitalist Development offers a provocative theory of postcolonial capitalism, one that advances the debate by forcing us to sharpen our conception of what Sanyal calls the "capital – not-capital" complex, a term he uses to characterise the entire complex of capitalist and non-capitalist production activities which coexist in contemporary political economy. While Sanyal's text remains generative to think with, its limitations – particularly concerning its engagements with Marx's theory of capitalism – merit critical scrutiny.
Vol. 49, No. 34 (AUGUST 23, 2014)||special article||Botched-up Development and Electoral Politics in India||PRAKASH KASHWAN||The debates about the general election campaign in India have often pitted "development" against secularism. In the process, questions about the emergence of alternative political formations have been pushed to the sidelines. This article argues that a development versus secular polarisation of national debates reflects a gross simplification of the politics of development in independent India. Through an examination of the historical antecedents of the contemporary dominance of the political right in Gujarat and by drawing on recent research, this article makes two interrelated arguments. First, it shows that the success of the right is inextricably linked to the botched-up development priorities of the past several decades. Second, it points to the inadequacy of the pro-poor policies and programmes promoted by the left-of-the-centre political coalitions.

The findings indicate that the R&D landscape is equally divided into centre-for-globals, executing arms of the global headquarters, and local-for-globals, equal partners in technological collaborations. The linkage between R&D centres and local actors appears to be weak. The knowledge spillovers are enabled by the circulation of labour pool in the industry. Based on this study, the paper offers some policy suggestions.

The amendment bill, introduced in Parliament on 29 August 2013, aimed to promote rational regulation of safe and effective allopathic drugs. That bill would have been yet another patch on an Act which has already been stretched beyond breaking point. It would have done little to provide a rigorous foundation for putting safety, effectiveness, rationality and need at the heart of the country's drug regulatory system. It is to be hoped that the government will make a complete overhaul of the Act one of its highest priorities.

This article, which draws attention to the refashioning of the conventional cinema in the aftermath of the demise of the parallel-mainstream division in India, focuses on two questions. Does the idea of the "popular cinema" itself survive the end of the "great divide"? Can it really assimilate the political charge of the oppositional cinema?

This article compares three biographies of Anandibai and argues that her persona, especially her relationship with Gopalrao, needs to be revisited by postcolonial feminist scholarship in order to unravel the tremendous intellectual and imaginative adventure that Anandibai's journey was and to explore the thoroughgoing radicalism that informed the shaping of Anandibai's life.

Far from being above and outside of politics as its exponents would have us believe, anti-corruption narratives are in fact inextricably mired in political struggle. Corruption's meanings and the uses to which they are put have changed with the liberalisation of the economy in India. This article traces the way in which India's increasingly assertive middle-classes have co-opted the anti-corruption discourse and used it as a tool to discredit their political opponents – the political class and the poor.

In conclusion, the paper suggests policy and practice measures for women's economic empowerment that may facilitate the process of closing gender gaps.

It is found that levels or changes in market structure are not exactly consistent across various measures. However, as compared to additive measures, inequality indices give more consistent results, and hence can be used to examine the structure of markets in different industries. Nonetheless, since there are inconsistencies across different inequality indices, efforts should be made towards formulating a suitable criterion for selecting the most appropriate measure.

But the path that leaders of the Palestinians have chosen, of violent resistance to the coloniser and occupier, has not yielded freedom from Israeli control. "Revolutionary" violence, first from Al Fatah and then Hamas, ultimately devolved into rent-seeking by a narrow Palestinian elite with a final settlement indefinitely deferred as per the design of a brutal, vicious and utterly immoral Israel. When faced with a test of violence it knows it cannot win, a people could simply choose not to play that particular game. If the Palestinians were to foreground non-violent political tactics, it will democratise the question of national strategy by showing everyday people that they too are soldiers of freedom. The Palestinian people now have to reclaim their half-state and refashion it into a real weapon of resistance.

While much of the media coverage has focused on the poverty lines recommended by the Committee, this article evaluates the methodology adopted and discusses some wider issues that were flagged in the terms of reference set for this Committee. It argues that the Committee missed an opportunity to mark a significant departure from previous approaches (especially in widening the measure of poverty) and provides illustrative empirical evidence in support of this assertion.
Vol. 49, No. 32 (AUGUST 9, 2014)||special article||Explaining Employment Trends in the Indian Economy: 1993-94 to 2011-12||SANTOSH MEHROTRA, JAJATI PARIDA, SHARMISTHA SINHA and ANKITA GANDHI||This paper explores employment trends in India since the mid-1990s based on study of various rounds of National Sample Survey unit level data. The major findings are of a structural transformation with an absolute fall in agricultural employment and a rise in non-agricultural employment, increasing participation in education, decline in child labour, mechanisation of agriculture and rising living standards in rural areas due to a growth in real wages which led to a decline in workforce, most of which was of women leaving the workforce. A fall in demand for manufacturing exports and increasing capital intensity also resulted in a decline in manufacturing employment during 2004-05 – 2009-10. The paper estimates that approximately 17 million jobs per annum need to be created in non-agriculture during 2012-17. Based on these estimates, the paper makes policy suggestions to increase non-agricultural employment in India.
Vol. 49, No. 32 (AUGUST 9, 2014)||special article||The Colonial Origins of Indian Foreign Policymaking||VINEET THAKUR||This paper looks at three aspects of India's foreign policymaking. First, it argues that the institutional history of the foreign office in India is as old as the colonial project. Second, that the first world war was a major tipping point in Indian diplomatic history as the country gained a quasi-international status. While internationally it meant that India's status was closer to that of a dominion than a colony, domestically it catapulted more and more Indians into positions of influence in foreign policymaking. On major strategic issues Indian foreign policy was still conducted from the India Office in London. However, on a number of other important, even if normative, issues, Indians increasingly determined the agenda. Third, the paper discusses how in its post-Independence foreign policy India projected itself as a continuous international entity, rather than a new one, thus choosing to continue rather than close the colonial legacy of foreign policy.

This study examines, with a critical perspective, the crucial role played by the home-school overlap in the lives of Muslim girls. It describes and analyses the ethos surrounding their impoverished lives and education. A hermeneutic interpretation is offered for a stock phrase they frequently use to represent their lives and aspirations. This analysis takes us to deeper, hidden layers of the girls' own discourse. By focusing on the learner's perspective, the study captures a conceptual inadequacy of prevailing policies dealing with girls' education.
Vol. 49, No. 32 (AUGUST 9, 2014)||discussion||Political Future of Caste in West Bengal||ARVIND KUMAR and AYAN GUHA||Contributing to the ongoing discussion (Sinharay 2012, 2014; Chandra and Nielsen 2012; Bandyopadhyay 2012; Chatterjee 2012; Samaddar 2013) in the EPW on the role of caste in Bengal politics, this article argues that the present tendency is to envisage a larger political role of caste on the basis of a faulty exercise of equating the electoral defeat of the left parties with the decline of the left ideology. The argument overlooks the deep hangover of a secular-leftist-political culture in Bengali society and therefore fails to understand the limited scope of caste politics in modern Bengal.

The purpose of the discipline of political studies is to inform us about a political community, while "applied political studies" reduces it to a functional utility.

Vol. 49, No. 31 (AUGUST 2, 2014)||special article||Social Welfare and Household Consumption Expenditure in India – 2004-05 to 2011-12||BHASKAR DUTTA and MANOJ PANDA||This paper uses a modification of the well-known statistical concept of the Lorenz curve – the Generalised Lorenz curve – and its associated social welfare properties to measure changes in well-being of households in India during the last decade using the National Sample Survey data on household consumption expenditure for 2004-05, 2009-10 and 2011-12. The paper shows that at the all-India level, there has been an unambiguous fall in poverty during these years. This pattern is also observed in most (but not all) states. It also compares the rate of growth of per capita consumption expenditure of the bottom four deciles and that of the population as a whole. The scatter diagram of the rates of growth for these deciles and of average consumption shows an upward trend, providing some indication that the trickle-down hypothesis may have worked.
Vol. 49, No. 31 (AUGUST 2, 2014)||special article||The Last Sahibs: Governors in British India, March-August 1947||RAKESH ANKIT||Little has been written about the role of provincial governors in the closing period of British rule in India with all the emphasis being on the Viceroys. This article instead considers the sahibs in the provinces. When British India came to an end on 15 August 1947, it had 11 provinces under 13 governors (11 Britons, two Indians). These last governors of British India, located in a subjective space, found themselves straddling the dichotomy of the coloniser and the colonised. Based on the hitherto unused private papers and correspondences of Mountbatten and the governors, this article seeks to throw a different light on the engagements of the last days of the British in provincial India, where the rulers of the past (British governors) and rulers of the future (Indian ministers) jostled with each other.

The Congress Party opted for land reforms as that would transform India into a progressive nation. As the 1949 Constitution decided in its favour, the responsibility of implementation was left to the states. One state which emerged as the leader in agrarian reforms was Jammu and Kashmir, led by Sheikh Abdullah. This article reviews the land relations and agrarian reforms in Jammu and Kashmir and suggests implications this had for the politics of the state.

It is commonly assumed that Tagore spent this entire sum on the asrama school in Santiniketan, and later for setting up his dream project – the Visva-Bharati University. The truth, however, is quite different. This note attempts to revisit the "will" of the poet, arguing that his decision regarding the investment of the substantial sum reveals a complex story in which the need of the peasants of his zamindari and that of the community in Visva-Bharati were held in a delicate ethical balance.

The Government of India too has announced its decision to amend important legislations and has called for public comments.

When faced with evidence of a poor conviction rate, instead of inquiring whether the prosecution was poorly conducted, the Court assumes that the "disgruntled wives" filed false cases. Ironically, while the courts convict husbands and their families in cases of dowry deaths, the woman's invocation of Section 498A when she fears for her life or demands her share of the matrimonial home, earns her the accusation of being a "disgruntled wife".
Vol. 49, No. 30 (JULY 26, 2014)||oral history||Speaking of the Past: Perspectives on Oral History||INDIRA CHOWDHURY||This collection of five papers presents some key issues in understanding oral history, not only as a resource but also as an interpretative apparatus that opens up new ways of understanding the past. The range of work included here presents insights into the role played by memory, language and politics within oral history scholarship. Is it possible that these insights can encourage thinking in a new direction that takes orality, oral traditions and oral history seriously, and forms the first steps towards a new discipline?
Vol. 49, No. 30 (JULY 26, 2014)||oral history||On the Uses of Memory: As Monument, As Reflex, As Disturbance||ALESSANDRO PORTELLI||Memory is often discussed as an asset or a liability. Memory can function as "monument" in the form of commemoration and celebration of a proud collective identity, and a foundation on which individuals build their own identity. The function of memory, however, can be that of making us uneasy about ourselves and our history. This paper discusses in these terms the memory of two events that have shaped Italian national memory and identity: the Risorgimento (the war of national independence and unification) and the Resistance (the war of liberation from Fascism and Nazism). While both episodes are often celebrated in (literally) monumental terms, oral histories reveal hidden contradictions.

After the Velvet Revolution, oral history became desirable for the purposes of democratisation, and also became necessary as there was a lack of "official" written documents. The current "boom" in oral history has had both negative and positive impacts: there exists a misuse of oral history for political purposes and the "hunt for sensation" on the one hand, and "giving voice" and democratisation of history on the other.

Beginning its investigation with a performance and painting tradition that is still living, this article asks in what ways oral traditions — songs and performances — can be used as resources to understand the relationship between history and memory. It demonstrates the ways in which oral tradition and oral history might converge and map out a distinct relationship between experience and memory, and thus point towards a different understanding of events and their interpretations.

In this paper, we link the memories of a group of South Asian overseas doctors, working in an elite profession with a distinctly non-elite group of patients, to an earlier set of archived interviews with the founders of the geriatric specialty. Our analysis identifies muted voices, generates recognition, and acknowledges ways of understanding and using the polyphony of difference. We argue that the value of reusing archived oral history data lies in the possibility for multiple interpretations of old and new data, and with this, new ways of hearing and listening to voices in interviews.
Vol. 49, No. 30 (JULY 26, 2014)||oral history||Listening to Silence, Reading between the Lines and Creating Archives: Why Is Oral History Not an Independent Discipline?||SUROOPA MUKHERJEE||This paper moves away from definitions of oral history as a purely research methodology or secondary source material for mainstream disciplines, by concentrating on the variables it offers as a pedagogical device, and more importantly, as study material for arts and activism. It argues that oral history needs to become an independent discipline in central/state universities, with a well-defined curriculum in place. India has a wide repertoire of oral forms in the domain of cultural practice, but what is missed out are the ways in which voices get silenced. The reformulation of oral history methods of perception and understanding have to come from within systems of education, which stretches from primary to higher levels.
Vol. 49, No. 30 (JULY 26, 2014)||special article||Should Real Wages of Workers Go Up in Indian Manufacturing?||T MURALIDHARAN, BINO PAUL G D and ASHUTOSH BISHNU MURTI||This paper argues why it is important for real wages of workers in Indian manufacturing to go up. During 1998/99-2010/11, the growth in nominal wages appears to have been crowded out by a consistent increase in the consumer price index for industrial workers, rendering a scenario of temporally stagnant real wages in the manufacturing sector. There appears to be a discernible disparity between wage rates of directly employed and temporary workers. Moreover, trend growth rates of wages of supervisory and managerial staff, notwithstanding variation across industries, are significantly higher than that of workers, indicating that the stagnation of the real wage is presumably a stylised fact for workers but not for managerial and supervisory staff. The institution of minimum wage in India seems to be lackadaisical in enforcing a floor wage that compensates for a rise in prices, and providing a premium for the skill. The elasticity of real wages to average productivity of workers appears to be of a perceptibly lower magnitude.

Although the relationship between economic restructuring and occupational/industrial diversities is fraught with ambiguities, it may generally be hypothesised that such enhanced openings would contribute towards the reduction in the often observed gendered segregation of labour in industries. Based on the unit level National Sample Survey Office data for various rounds, this study attempts to identify the industries in which women have stereotypically been bunched, and traces whether any changes have come about therein. The study also examines the role of education in diversification of industries in terms of men-women workforce composition. Even as the horizon of the labour market widens, it has not been able to provide women with expanded economic spaces.

What little exists hardly does justice to the country's elderly poor, who are forced to contend with daunting challenges late in life when they have few resources and are partially or entirely dependent on others. More alarmingly, reliable data on the elderly and their situation is lacking. Unless the state acknowledges its responsibility to the elderly, without hoping that the market will come to its aid, today's inexcusable callousness to the aged may seem mild when the crisis that is waiting to happen hits us.

We need not fear that the Western Ghats will vanish if the expert panel recommendations are not accepted in toto: the forest area is still in safe hands, and the people's organisations (the village forest committees) are fully aware of the importance of conservation to their own survival and for serving global interests. The government has to set up workable arrangements that have the acquiescence of the population at large, so they need not feel rattled by the hard stance adopted by the environmentalists in public.

It explores the exemptions from specific labour regulations accorded to particular activities and locates the anti-labour positions in the arbitration mechanisms under the state and judicial reinterpretations of existing laws. The popular discourse on labour regulation in India has been arguing in favour of labour market flexibility and doing away with restrictive labour legislation since it believes that labour laws hamper investment and growth of employment. This paper points to the increasing tendency of the Indian state to circumvent the gamut of existing labour laws, which in any case exist more on paper than in practice, by disengaging from the popular discourse on labour reforms and instead engaging in seemingly harmless norms of voluntary action and corporate social responsibility to facilitate accumulation.
Vol. 49, No. 26/27 (JUNE 28-JULY 5, 2014)||special article||Defining an Absence: Torture 'Debate' in India||JINEE LOKANEETA||This article focuses on the absence of a torture "debate" in India. The absence is striking when considered in relation to the National Human Rights Commission's statistics that there were 1,473 deaths in judicial custody and 124 in police custody in 2009-10. While the NHRC does not attribute all these deaths to custodial torture, there is a close link between the two as confirmed by many human rights groups. While this absence of a debate can be addressed at various levels, the paper articulates some of the theoretical framings that allow for a denial of torture to take place in India despite evidence of high levels of custodial deaths and torture. It suggests that the denial in multiple sites, most visible in the state discourses, contributes centrally to an absence of a public debate on torture in India.

Locating the process of social and economic transformation witnessed in the two villages after the green revolution and later after the introduction of large-scale industrial projects in the area, the paper tries to explore the nature of changes taking place in the internal structure (caste and class relations) of the agrarian economy; the changing nature of relationships of villages with the neighbouring urban settlements in terms of employment and aspirations; and the emerging nature of power relations in local political institutions.

The brunt of this is borne by workers and their families belonging to marginalised tribal communities. This gives space to organised crime to lure a large number of women and children to distant places on the pretext of providing them with jobs, which almost invariably leads to exploitation at a later stage. The findings of this study, done in 12 sick and closed tea gardens in Jalpaiguri district, demonstrate the close link between vulnerabilities, migration, and trafficking in children and women. It also suggests there have been changes in the nature of human trafficking in the country, calling for a new policy perspective on the issue.

It looks into the possibility of a Lewsian transformation causing an increase in real rural wages, but the result of the analysis suggests that the rise in wages is because of an increase in bargaining power due to public works programmes, which employ unskilled rural workers. Food price inflation induces them to bargain for higher wages.

Using the latest data sets – Census 2011 and the National Sample Survey housing condition round for 2008-09 – and the improved methodology used by the technical group on urban housing shortage, this paper re-estimates the rural shortage to be 62.01 million in 2012. Households living in temporary houses and in congested conditions were found to be mainly responsible for the rural housing shortage. The results suggest the need for holistically focusing on eradicating shelter deprivation in rural India and contributing to an enhancement of the quality of life of the people.
Vol. 49, No. 26/27, Supplement: Review of Rural Affairs (JUNE 28-JULY 5, 2014)||----||Financial Literacy in Rural Banking: Proposal for an Alternative Approach||SUKANYA BOSE and ARVIND SARDANA||Financial literacy in the present Indian policy context is seen as an instrument to raise demand for banking services. The location of the problem as one of deficient demand is untenable. The conception of financial literacy, as reflected in the Reserve Bank of India's Financial Literacy Guide, is packed with stereotypes of the poor as ignorant and in need of moral lessons on savings, consumption and credit. Financial literacy has to be positioned within a broader conceptual view of the financial system, so as to become a tool to raise critical consciousness and equip people to respond to the challenges posed by the financial sector. Further, financial literacy material must evolve from below, such that lives of the common people are organically a part of it. This paper also hints that the campaign mode for financial literacy might allow for greater public engagement and action. The effects of financial literacy, however, will not accrue if it is not accompanied by adequate outreach of banking services through credible public institutions.

Low profitability has prompted many small farmers to leave agriculture and 28% of them have entered the labour market. More pressingly, a significant number have preferred to take their own lives.

Evidence from a Major Indian Hospital||RAJSHRI JAYARAMAN, DEBRAJ RAY and SHING-YI WANG||A central feature of many developing countries is the presence of significant gender differentials in health outcomes. Two potential factors that can account for this are that females access treatment later than males and that they receive differential care at the medical facility. This paper explores both of these in the context of eye care. The paper studies diagnostic and surgical outcomes of 60,000 patients who sought treatment over a three-month period in 2012 at the Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai, Tamil Nadu. The results show that at presentation, women have worse diagnoses than men for indicators of symptomatic illness. To resolve gender-based health inequalities in developing countries, we need to know where these inequalities lie. This paper finds them in access but not care. The findings suggest that women seek treatment later than men for symptomatic illness. That no such gender differential exists for asymptomatic diseases suggests that women do not necessarily go for regular preventive check-ups at a lower frequency than men. The paper finds no systematic evidence that women and men receive differential medical treatment.

That the socio-economic consequences of allowing present trends to continue will be serious is already manifest in widening disparities between castes and communities, classes, rural and urban areas, and individuals. Measures meant to counter this have not been pursued seriously and have had little effect on the ground reality of persistent inequality, slow growth, and an unacceptably high incidence of mass poverty and unemployment. This article calls for a radical retuning of policies aimed at achieving inclusive economic growth and a more egalitarian distribution of income.

Assessment of lightning fatality figures and its comparison with other major natural disasters reveal that lightning ranks number one amongst the natural calamities in India (average 1,755 deaths per year). This number is much higher than those reported from elsewhere in the world. The geospatial distribution of lightning incidences and the 12 Indian states that have the most lightning casualties are identified.

A study of the rules under the Right to Education Act in Karnataka shows that there are a multitude of authorities which perform grievance redress functions with overlapping jurisdictions. The rules create a parallel, informal grievance redress system that primarily comprises officials against whom grievances may arise.

This paper shows how Muslim women who have migrated to Jamia Nagar in Delhi are leading a more fulfilling life in their new locality, as is evident from the fact that they claim to have migrated for social security, well-being, better opportunities and higher education. Many of them are fleeing from small-town prejudices and overbearing families. However, it is also true that while Muslim women, belonging to different socio-economic backgrounds seek mobility, this is often achieved within the rubric of familial and community strategies of both migration and of living together as members of the same community in a territorial space marked out as their own. This has certain implications that both facilitate as well as impede their need for employment, safety and autonomy. Legal and policy frameworks must pay more attention to women migrants to create a gender sensitive migration policy.

During this two-year period, around 11 million jobs were created at an annual growth rate of around 1.1% per annum. Both rural and urban India witnessed a sharp decasualisation of employment, especially of females, and a significant improvement in the creation of regular wage employment as compared to previous rounds of the National Sample Survey. There was a faster decline in the share of workers in the farm sector during this period, while manufacturing and service sectors witnessed high growth rates in employment.

It has been driven by growth of the town's economy and the practice of entrepreneurs investing in land for capital accumulation. The process described in this paper reinforces the theories of subaltern urbanisation and in situ urbanisation. While the role of the town's entrepreneurs, local landowners, and politics have been significant factors in shaping the evolution and development of its economy, the transformation story has also been shaped by supra-local flows of capital and labour from the region.

These settlements are cases of denied urbanisation, where the territory takes an urban shape but infrastructure and services remain poor under rural local governments that lack resources. Some of these towns retain their census town status for decades, and basic services are neglected until they achieve urban status. Based on empirical research carried out in Singur, a census town in West Bengal, this paper looks at the nature of urbanisation in these towns and tries to trace the role of politics in controlling access to urban status. It also explores the complexity of governance in census towns and surrounding urban areas.

It shows a pattern of largely informal development and the gradual emergence of a new industry and politics centred on land. This paper which throws light on the evolution and dynamics of urbanisation arising in Solapur, brings out the disconnects that cut across its industrial, spatial, political and social landscapes and reveals a town functioning at low levels of industrial dynamism and physical and social infrastructure, characterised by high levels of poverty.

New governance mechanisms inspired by neo-liberal thinking make claims about making cities function better, substantially improving basic infrastructure and public services, and increasing local democratic participation. But a study conducted in two non-metropolitan cities in Andhra Pradesh indicates that the state has promoted public-private partnerships, outsourcing and contracting out in a way that serves private interests rather than social interests. The disparities between poor residents and non-poor residents have increased and caste plays an increased role in decision-making bodies, though through a so-called inclusive participatory approach.

It is an examination of the practice of regularisation of these gunthewaris, and its relationship to other domains of urban governance. It argues that regularisation is an attempt to create a constant state of exception. Regularisation enables the abdication of state responsibility for public housing and planning, while engaging in tokenistic exercises of welfare.

It puts the spotlight back on a class of small industrial towns, where the dirty work of production, particularly of recycling industrial cast-offs, assembling secondary products and catering to low-end domestic markets is not moved out of urban spaces. Instead it is kept hemmed into unplanned and unserviced town spaces, while large formal manufacturing firms colonise rural hinterlands. It also highlights how disconnects among sectors, space and place can keep a town at low levels of dynamism and social welfare.

Once boundaries are operationalised on the basis of territorial belonging, politics revolves around who is from a particular place and who is not. This has created opportunities for accumulation for the indigenous people through rents. The state simultaneously installs and destabilises this politics of indigeneity. The paper shows how the state and capital are implicated in the structures of enfranchisement that have historically shaped the town.
Vol. 49, No. 22 (MAY 31, 2014)||special article||Feminist Vocabularies in Time and Space: Perspectives from India||MARY E JOHN||This paper situates the trajectories of feminism and women's rights in a history of thought spanning the 19th century to the present. It offers an alternate mode of engagement with the perceived problem of the dependency of the "East" on "Western" epistemologies and theories. Allowing for power-laden relationships between places and peoples, it argues that attention should focus on the modes in which concepts are made to work and provide insight, rather than on their "purity" in relation to an ascribed point of origin. This is demonstrated through the three epistemes that have broadly characterised the "women's question" in a comparative frame - the colonial, the national and the post-national. Feminism in India is thus mobilised for generating conceptual frames that are good to think with, whether within the nation or beyond.

However, newer, equally stringent conditions are getting superimposed such as educational preferences and of living or working in the US. This paper shows how the educational and migratory aspirations of a young, mobile generation have given rise to newer behavioural patterns that pulsate in matrimonial alliances. By examining the profiles of Telugu brahmin brides and grooms, we explore the meanings of a new, coded vocabulary that has come into vogue to communicate partner preferences and the nuances therein. Through this we try to decipher the changes taking place in the matrimonial space of present-day India.

There is nothing esoteric or mystic about them; they are things that we all know. The rules of dharma serve as rules of the limits of power. The rules of dharma are also the rights of the ruled, the right to expect that the State will treat them without fear or favour. Transgressing them leads to tragedy.

The potential shocks could cause short-term volatility, though the economy now seems better placed than a year ago to face the challenge. Yet, stabilisation does not ensure economic revival. Stepping up investment demand, without jeopardising the current account balance and increasing external debt would be the key to sustainable growth. As the private corporate sector is mired in debt, a pragmatic increase in public investment by revisiting fical rules is the only credible option. A complete pass-through of fuel prices to domestic consumers would encourage investment in the industrial and energy sectors, while an easy credit for agriculture and small-scale industry is likely to augment wage goods output to restrain the rise in consumer prices.

AP has transformed from an agriculture-based economy at the time of its formation to a service-sector based economy today. A political economy narrative of the process is described with focus on three important cleavages – class, caste and region. It is argued that there has been a crisis for both the idea and materiality of AP for a while that has now led to an imminent dissolution of the "united state". The development of a particular variety of capitalism in AP has happened through the successful wearing down of two major radical mobilisations (during the 1930s-50s and 1970s-90s) and through a counter-radical episode of primitive accumulation that began in the 1980s which continues till today.
Vol. 49, No. 21 (MAY 24, 2014)||special article||Gender Wage Discrimination across Social and Religious Groups in India: Estimates with Unit Level Data||ANINDITA SENGUPTA and PANCHANAN DAS||This paper focuses on gender wage discrimination across different social and religious groups by addressing the fact that the observed productivity differences between women and men are not only responsible for the huge gender wage gap in India, but for the same levels of productivity, women have been paid lower wages than men. Gender discrimination, superimposed on caste and religious discrimination, accentuates the social exclusion of women belonging to certain castes and religions. We try to reveal how the incidence of the gender pay gap among different religious and social groups changed during the first decade of economic reforms. The presence of substantial wage differentials between men and women workers in the Indian labour market cannot be explained simply by the gender gap of human capital. Discrimination was more severe for women workers in the backward ethnic groups as compared to other women workers.

Based on field research conducted in 2012 on all completed small hydropower projects in the state, it examines the implementation of Himachal Pradesh's small hydropower policy and highlights the local social and environmental impacts of small hydropower development. The vast majority of small hydropower projects have generated unmitigated negative effects; employment generation, while significant, is mostly temporary, and uncompensated deaths from construction-related accidents are especially worrying. Insights from this study provide the basis for proposing concrete steps that together could help small run-of-the-river hydropower projects realise their purported, but not realised, benefits.

Industry is spending a smaller proportion of value added on interest payments than it did in the earlier decades. However, compared to the 1980s, the share of profit in gross value added has increased significantly, while factory-floor workers' emoluments as a share of total earnings have reduced.

Although no community is officially declared indigenous, the central and state governments grant constitutional and political concessions to certain tribal communities in the north-east, recognising their claims to indigeneity. But in the region, the quesion of who is indigenous remains contentious. While reflecting on the implications of recognising some communities in the region as indigenous, this article focuses on the limitations of the politics of indigeneity.

The present ethnocentric crisis in Assam is so volatile that most of the "tribes" have already rejected the proposal to become part of an "Assamese" identity. One finds that colonial ethnography and anthropological approaches in postcolonial Assam play a very crucial role in the present unresolved crisis.

In order to problematise the biennale's ideology of cosmopolitanism, through which the organisers tried to surpass the existing institutions of art and democracy, this essay dwells upon the issues of spectatorship and the discursivity of art practices. It argues that there is a shift away from the principles of dissent and radical egalitarianism in the course of contemporary Indian art and that the biennale is an exemplary case of this turn.
Vol. 49, No. 20 (MAY 17, 2014)||special article||Revival of Rural Public Distribution System: Expansion and Outreach||ANDALEEB RAHMAN||This paper quantifies the improvements in the public distribution system in rural India after 2004-05 using data from three rounds of surveys conducted by the National Sample Survey. It finds that Tamil Nadu and Himachal Pradesh continue to be the leading performers, but early movers such as Odisha saw improvements in the functioning of the PDS between 2004-05 and 2009-10. In late movers such as Bihar and Jharkhand, improvement was evident between 2009-10 and 2011-12. The paper also estimates a seemingly unrelated regression model to quantify changes in the shares of consumption from the market, the PDS and home produce across states over the three rounds. The share of the PDS as a source of rice and wheat has increased over time, suggesting an improvement in its outreach.

While processes and platforms for citizen engagement like the gram sabha have been incorporated into policy and operational guidelines, the capability of the poor and marginalised to access them is severely compromised, leading to a subversion of development initiatives meant for the poor. The article attempts to understand the local citizen space and governance space as distinct from and complementary to each other, and demarcate the role of panchayats and community-based organisations with respect to these spaces.

The place of casteism in the larger matrix of the "Asiatic mode of production" can only be understood if the Eurocentric reasoning and the search for a fictitious "Indian feudalism" are avoided. This would also end the consequent illusory search for the transition from feudalism to capitalism, which has rendered the project of socialism in India to be a mirage.

The primary reason for this is the state's inability to realise its own revenue potential – West Bengal's own tax revenue to state domestic product ratio is the lowest among all Indian states. The state also uses borrowings to finance its non-plan expenditure. The state government now wants the centre to restructure its debt and suspend its interest payments for three years. Analysing different scenarios, this paper evaluates whether such a relief package is necessary, or even the best way of avoiding a debt trap.

It observes that compared to what is reflected in the national rural drinking water programme database, the drinking water coverage status is poorer on the ground and scheme failures are more widespread. The case studies show that the causes of scheme failures have largely remained unchanged in spite of the changes in policy regimes. Poor capacity and expertise of state agencies are the main cause of poor outcomes and improving them will require infusion of new knowledge and practices. National policy can assist state agencies by creating avenues for educational and research institutions to work with the latter in various monitoring, evaluation, design and validation roles.

A 10-state survey in 2013 revealed that the pension scheme was running reasonably well. There is strong evidence to support the fact that the money is reaching the intended beneficiaries without any major leakages. The patterns of usage of the pension are indicative of its importance in the lives of the beneficiaries. An evaluation of the scheme also brings to the fore issues related to the diminutive amount, inefficient disbursal mechanism, cost of collection and the lack of a fixed pattern of payment.

This account of the engagement of an Indian writer – from his teens to maturity – with Camus tries to look at this influence, its validity and its relationship with the Indian social imaginary. It argues that the content of "the absurd" and the realisation of the limitations of "modernity" were very different in Indian conditions from those prevalent in post-war Europe, even though there were overlaps.

As the record of pre-poll opinion surveys in the 2004 and 2009 Lok Sabha elections shows, the opinion polls have many weaknesses while attempting to make forecasts in a complex situation. In such a setting, the polls can be used as covert instruments by political parties to make seat predictions and thereby influence the electorate.

But the probable effects of this involvement have not been given adequate attention. Thus, there appears to be an easy parallel between the sanskritisation of modern Bangla and that of modern Hindi. This article is an attempt to explore the ways in which these apparently similar processes might also be dissimilar in significant respects. Further, it seeks to push certain hints that the two processes might also be interdependent. It argues, finally, that this similarity masks a complex and deeply consequential process of cultural "translation".

The report's objective assessment of the prevailing situation and the recommendations that it should be taken to all the gram sabhas, and appropriate regulatory and promotional measures decided through a bottom-up democratic process were unacceptable to those currently benefiting from the perpetuation of an economy of violence.

While some of the controversies about the RTE Act were reported in the media and publicly discussed, this paper reports data from semi-structured interviews with key education officials and implementers, some of whom were responsible for drafting the Act, and traces successive iterations of draft bills. The paper exposes contestation, controversy and concessions that were made in policy backrooms throughout the processes framing the Act.

Numerous applications are filed every year in the Supreme Court and the high courts for appointment of arbitrators. This paper argues that (1) the judiciary has virtually created a monopoly by institutionalising appointment of retired judges as arbitrators; (2) courts have eliminated competition from other potentially capable professionals for appointment as arbitrators; and (3) there is lack of transparency in the process of appointment of arbitrators. Information to gauge the level of transparency in the appointment process has been obtained from 10 high courts and the Supreme Court through the Right to Information Act, 2005.

This article points out that a growing number of studies see a very critical role for renewable energy sources in the near future. Whether to combat poverty or global warming, our attention needs to turn to these cheaper, safer, sustainable, and people-friendly technologies.

Using feminist work on the politics of waste, it argues that gendered precariousness is produced through human-as-waste conditions besides underscoring the importance of understanding it as a lived and felt process of precarity-in-the-making. This process not only shapes gendered experiences of precariousness wrought by environmental degradation but also informs sociopolitical struggles against precariousness and for social memory and belonging. It argues that these spaces of political struggle often also produce gendered contradictions and specific gendered divisions of labour within their political praxis.

Vol. 49, No. 17 (APRIL 26, 2014)||review of women's studies||You Are Woman: Arguments with Normative Femininities in Recent Malayalam Cinema||ANEETA RAJENDRAN||Malayalam cinema's constructs of femininity offer interesting insights into economies of gender in contemporary Kerala. Female self-fashioning in films has overwhelmingly centred around valorising a normative femininity, defined here as a femininity that privileges motherhood and the moral upbringing of the Malayalee nation through a moral submission to patriarchy. Agential roles for female protagonists are rare; the convention is to "punish" within the narrative female refusal of normative femininity. Three films, Trivandrum Lodge (2012), Gaddama (2011) and 22 Female Kottayam (2012), are read as challenging this edging out of the "woman question" through their naturalisation of female protagonists' habitation of spheres other than the private/domestic. In the process they question the normalisation of discourses of reproductive heteronormativity and nationalist purity through women.

The impact of the three political developments of recent times — the feminist movement, the politicisation of sex workers, and the queer movement — is also looked at. Citing instances from popular debates and cultural artefacts, it charts out the complex trajectories of "regional" imaginations and conceptualisations of gender and sexualities in contemporary India.

There were gendered, community-based, official, unofficial, and popular ideas about children in the context of marriage and out of the competing official discourses on gender and modernity in Travancore, the one related to Christianity eventually became dominant. It presents the layers of discourses related to gender and child marriage: an official one in census reports, another in mid-level legal discussions, and a third more popular view. It discusses official presentations about gender relations as found in census reports in which concepts of modernity and civilisation are crucial and also an account of debates in the Travancore Legislative Council about child marriage in the 1930s. It also reviews a large number of cases involving dialogues between citizens and civil servants.

The theoretical aspects of space and gender, in the context of how they are mutually formed and how gendered spaces are produced in the workers' everyday lives are analysed. A geographical explanation of the formation of such gendered spaces under home-based production is presented, following which everyday labour relations and the framing of workers' response strategies, which brought capital and labour to the negotiating table, are illustrated.

Drawing on research and studies on the EWI and its economic impact, it addresses three interrelated issues. First, the rationale behind labour regulations and labour standards and their evolution overtime. It argues that these regulations and standards are as relevant in today's world as they were in the past. Second, the paper reviews the methodological basis of the ewi and its scope in interpreting the economic impact of labour regulations. Third, it argues for moving beyond indicator-based rankings, to develop a better understanding of the complex interactions between different labour market institutions and the impediments to effective implementation of labour norms. In this context, the paper provides some insights into the limitations of the current labour regulatory framework in India in protecting workers' rights.

Despite having tertiary-level education, their search for employment is an extended one, marked by anxiety, hardship and uncertainty, which often precipitates a sense of hopelessness and shame. By utilising qualitative research methods, this article shows how youth contest their marginalisation, for example, by equipping themselves with skills and competencies, or migrating. Despite their attempts, the educated lower-middle-class youth in Dehradun do not possess sufficient stocks of economic, cultural and social capital to consolidate their class position. These findings contribute to debates about the Indian middle classes, social reproduction and neo-liberal development.

Failure to follow such a principle or to practice rhetorical rotation is just to pay lip service to the concept of deep democracy. Mainstream political parties in India have followed the principle of rhetorical rotation. Given the little experience that we have had with the Aam Aadmi Party, it is yet to base its new politics on a morally robust commitment to transformative, rather than reformative, politics.

In analysing two films by Vishal Bhardwaj and Dibakar Banerjee, the author argues that the incorporation of critical ideas on society and politics into the mainstream cinema reflects the diminishing potential of dissent in India, and is related to the rise of neo-liberalism and consumer culture. The present fascination with rural India and the subaltern figure in films means that the latter is being consumed as a product by the spectators of the films, as opposed to concern with social and political topics in politically committed cinema.

The main focus of implementation in the past decade has been to persuade local governments to set up biodiversity management committees, which are to compile people's biodiversity registers. The success of state biodiversity boards is measured in terms of the number of committees set up. In addition, the prospect of financial gains is driving the law's implementation. The need for what a genuine dialogue on what a people-centred, biodiversity-sensitive, location-specific development model would look like has been lost sight of.

Vol. 49, No. 16 (APRIL 19, 2014)||insight||Growth in the Time of UPA: Myths and Reality||MAITREESH GHATAK, PARIKSHIT GHOSH and ASHOK KOTWAL||This article challenges the prevailing view that the diminished electoral prospects of the United Progressive Alliance government is the result of neglecting growth to launch populist welfare schemes. It looks at a wide range of economic indicators to argue that compared to the National Democratic Alliance regime, the UPA period has been characterised by faster growth, higher savings and investment, growing foreign trade and capital inflows, and increased infrastructure spending in partnership with private capital. The UPA's political troubles arise not from policies that hurt growth but from an inability to tackle the consequences of accelerated economic growth – increased conflict over land, rent seeking and corruption in the booming infrastructure and natural resource sectors, inability of public education to keep up with increased demand and rising aspirations, and poor delivery of welfare schemes made possible by growing revenues.

But the way this critical entitlement is being implemented leaves much to be desired. Apart from there being glaring gaps in the provisions of the Act, its implementation challenges have plagued the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, the programme that is aimed at ushering in quality elementary education for all. The problems are many, and this paper observes that most of them can be connected to inadequate funds. It concludes that the best way of ensuring that the Act's aims are fulfilled is to bring in a common school system based on neighbourhood schools that replaces the bewildering variety of indifferent institutions we now have.
Vol. 49, No. 16 (APRIL 19, 2014)||special article||The Economics of Net Neutrality||ROHIT PRASAD and V SRIDHAR||The emergence of broadband networks – both wireline and wireless - has assisted in fostering the applications and content development, and provided content and application providers with a huge and growing addressable market with very low barriers to entry. However, there is always a tension between end-user connectivity providers and CAPs on the nuances of net neutrality, the principle that content consumed should be decided by the end-user without any distortion by the connectivity provider. While much attention has been paid to the technology dimensions of net neutrality, this paper addresses the economic dimensions, including access and termination pricing, the waterbed effect, and the two-sided nature of broadband markets. The paper also summarises regulatory views on net neutrality in the advanced countries such as the United States and the European Union and contrasts them with possibilities in emerging countries such as India.

It departs from conventional assessments of Nagaland elections, both scholarly and commentarial, which tend to emphasise its "electoral ills", and subsequently, condemn it as a mockery, if not a slur on democracy. This article argues towards a more contextualised, culturally-embedded understanding of Nagaland's electoral processes, which renders bare the incongruence between modern democracy and different traditional Naga polities, and bestows agency to them. It shows how different Naga tribes, instead of adjusting themselves to modern democratic ideals, adjusted democracy to themselves.

There is no evidence of any differential acceleration in the 2000s, when Narendra Modi has been in power, relative to the 1990s, both with respect to the country as a whole, as well as other major states. This is robust to using alternative measures of income (gross state domestic product or per capita income), alternative methods of computing growth rates, and keeping or dropping the year 2000-01, for which Gujarat had a negative growth rate following the Bhuj earthquake.

This paper intervenes in this debate with evidence from Tamil Nadu. Tamil Nadu, which, unlike Kerala, did not have initial advantages over Gujarat, outperforms the latter on nearly every development indicator at the level of indicators as well as in the rate of change. This is despite Gujarat having a slightly higher economic growth rate. Tamil Nadu's relative success is the result of state intervention in providing essential public services. Further, the history of social mobilisation in the state has been crucial in ensuring the formulation and efficient execution of social welfare measures.

Presenting a state-level analysis of the association between state net domestic product per capita and three children's health indicators, this paper describes how these relationships differ in the last two rounds of the National Family Health Survey. It finds evidence that the cross-sectional relationships between aggregate wealth and children's health indicators are positive, yet the association was less steep in the mid-2000s than in the late 1990s. It also finds a negative relationship between growth in SNDP per capita and improvement in state-level children's health indicators. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the kinds of investments which improve health may lead to economic growth, rather than vice versa.

The methodology is that of cross-section growth regressions, which seek to explain longer-run growth rates in terms of initial conditions of development. By identifying these connections, it seeks to illuminate the role of physical infrastructure, financial development, and human capital in influencing regional patterns of growth. In turn, this may have implications for government policies at the national and state levels.

Looking back, it is obvious that the best policy would have been to introduce the inactivated poliovirus vaccine to prevent polio in every vaccinated child, and to use oral poliovirus vaccine by pulse campaigns to eliminate WPVs rapidly. This would have eliminated polio decades ago. Now that WPVs have been eliminated, IPV must be introduced as a prelude to withdrawing OPV. The road ahead is bumpy, but with the important lessons learnt so far, India can no longer pretend that it is too difficult to design a permanent public health infrastructure to control other communicable and non-communicable diseases.

This process has been accentuated by neo-liberal policies and their implementation through a massive deployment of security forces. The strategy of dominance and governance has done little to reduce regional disparity between the coastal districts and inland regions, and it has been legitimised through the electoral process, welfare support, and the media.

It points out that Hindutva's systematic expansion, which also made use of Christianity's contentious legacy in the state, has communalised the everyday syncretic space. In recent years, the state's social and caste hierarchy, conservative elites, middle class, civil society, media, and neo-liberal political class have overtly and covertly reinforced Hindu majoritarian politics.

However, the political and state machinery seems to have enthusiastically climbed aboard the development bandwagon, especially in the mining sector, and is little inclined to heed the voices of the poor, marginalised people.

Political interests and state power, especially state-sponsored advertising, were its main drivers. The low-key relationship between the media and business changed dramatically in the 1990s. Corporate and business interests now dominate Odisha's media, both through direct ownership and through advertisements. The mainstream media in the state primarily reflects the interests of certain sections of society, and a model of development that favours corporate dominance and accumulation through dispossession. An alternative media is gradually emerging in the vernacular and on the web, but they face significant challenges.

Why was this claim not made when the Constitution was being framed? An exploration of the Constituent Assembly debates attempts to understand whether Christian castes were discussed and how fundamental religious liberties, which included crucial educational rights, were given importance over caste claims by the elite Christian representatives in the assembly. It draws a distinction between community rights and claims on the state. The implications of the cluster of rights known as "minority rights" are disentangled and the paper argues that the discriminatory clause in the Scheduled Castes Order of 1950 is part of the problem faced by dalit Christians. There is also a clash between the different kinds of entitlements at issue, which must be acknowledged to harmonise the justice of the state with fairness within the community.

New technologies are developed in the leading region but technological improvements in the lagging region are the result of learning from the leading region's technologies. The analysis sheds light on four salient questions. First, the paper determines the long-run growth rate of output per human capital unit in the leading region. Second, it defines a lagging to leading region technology ratio, study its stability properties, and then uses this ratio to ascertain the long-run growth rate of output per human capital unit in the lagging region. Third, for specific parameter values, it analyses the ratio of output per human capital unit in the lagging region to output per human capital unit in the leading region when both regions have converged to their balanced growth paths. Finally, the paper discusses the policy implications of our analysis and then offers suggestions for extending the research described here.

This is shown by constructing and comparing a child under-nutrition index and child nutrition score, both of which use data from India's latest National Family Health Survey (NFHS-3). The CUI indicates that 16 of the 28 states have high or very high levels of child under-nutrition. The CNS indicates that 24 states have poor or very poor performance in delivering essential nutrition interventions for children. The strongest association between the CUI and the CNS is that states with higher CNS tend to have lower CUI. Effective state governance systems need to prioritise programmes to scale up the coverage and equity of proven interventions in the fight against child under-nutrition in India.

This is so not because of the size of the sample, but because of the arbitrary restriction to villages within 5 kms of bus routes, whereas the bulk of the rural and tribal population is located farther from the roads. Further, it is argued that the Census of India data, which is used as the sampling frame, is found to be unreliable for Nagaland.

In a federal structure, where the allocation of local public services is devolved to subnational governments, the allocation pattern itself could vary between jurisdictions. This paper investigates the locational pattern of public service delivery points within states in India, using data from the Census Village Directory. Policy directions emerge from the empirical results.

These estimates suggest that inter-group differences in utilisation rates have less to do with characteristics and much more to do with group identity. The paper also suggests a trade-off between quality and utilisation by hypothesising that the poor quality of services leads upper-caste mothers to exit the ICDS market and seek these services elsewhere.

He was an ardent advocate of masculinity and sports. This article discusses the influential contributions to theories of masculinity which provide a framework within which Vivekananda's physical activities and gendered notions can be situated. His belief that football is not insignificant reveals his concerns for the development of manliness among the so-called effeminate Bengalis. He himself practised a number of colonial sports and expressed profound interest in golf though these sports were not seen as a form of leisure. The lessons of physical culture not only strengthened his body but empowered his mind against inequality and perils. Vivekananda appeals to the Hindu sources for his construction of the body and mind of the spiritual aspirant as a site delimited and shielded.

This article offers a strategy that takes us away from an economy split between the poor and the rich, and from a charitable notion of economic redistribution to the possibility of rights-based claims for economic justice.

It does not find evidence of any significant role of changes in voter age distribution, media exposure, private benefits received from development and welfare programmes administered by local governments, or the vote-generating effectiveness of such programmes. A more important role was played by voter dissatisfaction with local leaders on corruption and lack of involvement in the provision of education services, and with non-local leaders on attitudes towards women, the poor, and local communities.

This phenomenon does not conform to explanations that understand privatisation as a direct consequence of withdrawal of the state from higher education and challenges the idea that liberalisation has minimal impact on state funding of higher education. This article seeks to understand the phenomenon through a comparative analysis of the tertiary education sector in pre- and post-liberalisation Karnataka which turned into a site of patronage and social management. Privatisation became the means by which the regulatory state placated powerful local groups which stood to lose from the reform process.

The experiences and fate of many cases of sexual violence, where survivors have attempted to access the justice system, suggest a more complex structure of violence and impunity; AFSPA is only a small cog in this giant machinery of institutionalised repression.

But the states are dragging their feet as the metro-oriented 2011 regulations do not find favour with them. This article suggests framing of three different levels of simpler regulations for the metro, urban and rural areas, respectively, for conservation of historical buildings spread across thousands of towns and villages of the country.

At its heart is a plot line that is 72 years old and based upon the Urdu short story Lihāf about a homoerotic relationship between two women. The emergence of a female voice in the heyday of the Indian nationalist movement – both in terms of its commodification through radio and other new media as well as through collective political assertions by feminist critics – is narrated anew within Dedh Ishqiya.

It is, therefore, sought for rather than frowned upon – a lesson for the developed world. This would however require the location and accommodation of modern values in the broader plural framework. This would involve a paradigm shift from modernity to plurality.

The real wage rate for farm as well as non-farm rural labour is moving upwards. This has serious implications for the farm sector. This study examines the trend and pattern of rural labour diversification and identifies the underlying factors for this change. The movement of workers outside the agriculture sector was found to be influenced by a complex set of factors such as the pattern of economic growth, inter-sectoral differences in the wage rate and worker productivity, government programmes, education, and sociocultural factors prevailing in rural India.
Vol. 49, No. 10 (MARCH 8, 2014)||special article||Solar Irrigation Pumps: Farmers' Experience and State Policy in Rajasthan||AVINASH KISHORE, TUSHAAR SHAH and NIDHI PRABHA TEWARI||Price of solar panels has declined rapidly. Encouraged by increasing affordability of the technology and its promise to curb the demand for subsidised electricity, state governments in India are aggressively promoting solar irrigation pumps. Rajasthan became the pioneer by announcing a scheme in 2011 with 86% subsidy to horticulture farmers who used drip irrigation and farm ponds. Based on extensive fieldwork and survey in three districts of Rajasthan, this paper looks at the farmers' experiences, the design and implementation of the policy, and makes recommendations for a faster and more equitable diffusion of the technology, which could attack India's invidious nexus between energy and groundwater irrigation, and change it for the better.

This comparative analysis based on the findings from fieldwork conducted during 2010-12 points out that this sector has experienced mission drift and is no longer serving the poorest.

The regular differences every year between the advance and revised estimates of GDP suggest that the former will be modified either upwards or downwards when the final figures come in about two years hence. This is something the CSO needs to look into though there are definite reasons for why the revisions take place, leading to more accurate estimates. The new series of GDP at basic prices is also discussed here.

This approach to monetary policy is a product of the much-criticised "new consensus macroeconomics", a school of thought that is credited with causing the recent global financial crisis. The objectives for monetary policy that the committee suggests are not only theoretically unwarranted, but also unjustified for the current state of evolution of India's financial system.

It focuses on the interest rate to control inflation (by influencing inflation expectations), though experience has shown that in India this mechanism has a weak impact on inflation and a stronger one on output. It is a disappointing report drawing on a textbook reading of the New Keynesian model.

The economic policies promoted by the central government between 1980 and 2004 – irrespective of the political party heading the Cabinet – mostly benefited the middle class and the corporate sector, while the poor and the rural world were clearly relegated to a secondary position in the governments' policy priorities. From this point of view the election of the United Progressive Alliance government in 2004 might constitute a more important break with the past.

We find that distance from the central business district, proximity to the west coast, presence of slums, proportion of residential and commercial built-up areas, and proximity to the railway station have a significant impact on residential prices. Amenities and open spaces do not have any significant impact on prices. Further, we model the impact of the upcoming metro line on the residential prices. We find that the upcoming metro has no significant effect on prices. These findings have strong implications for policy decisions regarding introduction of land-based fiscal tools such as betterment levies for capturing land value appreciation that is expected to arise from new infrastructure.

There has been much ado in sociology over the debate between hermeneutic and positivist approaches. Drawing insights from D P Mukerji, we see his intervention as an attempt to find a way out of this impasse through a distinct rendition of the Marxian dialectic, which is seen as open rather than closed. His rendition combines three principles: taking sides, dynamics of the objective human reality, and most truthful to the wholeness. This unique rendition, D P Mukerji argues, is apt for addressing the philosophical problem of sociology in the context of the specificity of Indian history.

Looking at the 2012-13 escalation in the Cauvery river water dispute, this article examines how politics plays a part in shaping such disputes and sets limits on our responses to them through legal means. Considering the effects of politicisation, it argues that contrary to predictions of water wars, these politics may have a positive impact on accentuating interdependencies between states and deepening democratic spaces if they are supported by appropriate institutional responses.

He has ignored three tasks of the book - to distil from the key writings of Subaltern Studies the project's essential arguments, to assess the validity of their critique on empirical and conceptual grounds, and to offer an alternative theory, which succeeds where theirs fails.

In West Bengal they are richer, on average, and are therefore slightly taller. However, when wealth is held constant, children in Bangladesh are taller.

Vol. 49, No. 8 (FEBRUARY 22, 2014)||special article||A Critical Look at the Expansion of Banking Services through the Business Correspondent Model: Observations from Andhra Pradesh||S ANANTH and T SABRI ÖNCÜ||Examining the role of business correspondents in the expansion of banking services in Chittoor, Kurnool and Mahabubnagar districts of Andhra Pradesh, this paper attempts to shed light on what has been accomplished through the business correspondent model. Based on observations in the field, the findings are not readily extendable to all of India, though they make it possible to point to some policy suggestions. A major proposition is that individual business correspondents can be more effective than the other types of business correspondents in expanding financial inclusion through the business correspondent model, at least in Andhra Pradesh.

First, India remains a constitutional democracy even when authoritarianism is embedded in the architecture of the state. The second paradox is that internationally India is a model for "democratic-development" even though the country has regressed into an abyss of poverty, dispossession, internal strife, ecological precariousness, rising fundamentalisms and militarism since Independence. The Ghadar centenary year is an opportune moment to reflect on the constitutive nature of the rebellion-repression-reform cycles that is formative of the Indian state and Constitution.
Vol. 49, No. 8 (FEBRUARY 22, 2014)||special article||Public Distribution System Reforms and Consumption in Chhattisgarh: A Comparative Empirical Analysis||PRASAD KRISHNAMURTHY, VIKRAM PATHANIA and SHARAD TANDON||Chhattisgarh's public distribution system reforms have been lauded as a model for the National Food Security Act, and as one that other states can emulate. Previous research has shown that PDS rice consumption increased in Chhattisgarh following reforms by the Raman Singh government, which began in 2004. However, one-third of PDS rice consumption growth in Chhattisgarh took place before 2004. This finding suggests that the pre-2004 reforms to fair price shop ownership and state procurement by the Ajit Jogi government contributed to PDS consumption growth. Our findings suggest that sustained reforms, when coupled with political and social will, can improve PDS access, and that improvements may not be substantial or sustained in the absence of these factors.

The division which seemed to be political in the initial phase has now entered the social and cultural spaces.

Gradually, the Gujarati elites began intervening to discipline and domesticate it for urban as well as non-urban audiences. post-Independence, experimental theatre groups too attempted this reconstitution through exoticisation and production of "difference" between the folk and the elite. This paper explores and interrogates the assumption that folk-theatre like the Bhavai can be disciplined and transposed unproblematically to urban and non-urban audiences. Bhavai as folk-theatre is located in a set of temporal and spatial prerequisites. Divested of these conditions Bhavai ceases to be what it is.

The government's argument is that the Rathvas cannot be adivasis if they are Hindus. What makes the move ominous is that the Chhota Udepur region inhabited by the Rathvas is mineral-rich and laws that protect adivasi rights come in the way of corporate exploitation of these resources. The order could also set a precedent to threaten adivasis elsewhere who protest against the loot of natural resources in their areas.

Those upper castes who could wield the language and more or less controlled the teaching of it have repeatedly attempted to impose formal Telugu as though it was the only "correct" form. These impositions were opposed at different times in history by several Telugu pandits, who believed that language must be, first and foremost, intelligible to everybody. It is in this context that this article puts forth a dalit critique of the Telugu language.

This paper examines how far the government has been successful in realising its objective of inclusive growth. As evidence of outcomes, it examines the National Sample Survey data on household consumption distribution in terms of relative distributional measures across social groups at different levels of regional aggregation by rural and urban sector. The estimates from four different NSS rounds for the agricultural years 1993-94, 2004-05, 2009-10 and 2011-12 throw up a profile of exclusion of the poor involving exclusionary growth of the better-off in the economy as a whole. At the national level, disparities across social groups have increased involving a widening of the average consumption shortfall of the scheduled tribes, a decline for the scheduled castes, marginal decline for the Other Backward Classes and an increase in the excess of average consumption of Other Social Groups with respect to the overall median. Similar analyses at the level of major states, by sector, corroborate in general the findings at the national level of an era of exclusionary growth confined to the better-off sections.

With relatively tightly regulated financial markets, where concerns presently are more developmental than regulatory, the counterpart debate in emerging market economies centres on reconciling two widely held economic policy formulations, namely, the Mundell-Fleming "Impossible Trinity" and the "Taylor Rule". This article argues that EMEs can get around the trilemma by adopting a separate instrument as part of a consistent policy framework to target the external financial cycle. This would free up their interest rate policies to target the domestic business cycle, without the need to deviate from the Taylor Rule from time to time to target external financial stability.

Our empirical results show that voters do penalise candidates with criminal charges, but the magnitude of the penalty decreases if there are other candidates in the constituency with criminal charges. The vote shares are positively related to candidate wealth, with the marginal effect being higher for the candidates with criminal charges. Moreover, candidates with criminal charges also have greater wealth.

The article also insists that natural energy resources should be considered common property, and in order to make development meaningful and sustainable should remain so. Planned development of the national capability is an essential precondition to maximise the potential use of natural resources. In the context of Bangladesh, a ban on exporting mineral resources and open-pit mining is also necessary to ensure energy security and sustainable development. It concludes that energy-sovereignty is the key to energy security, and therefore to sustainable development.
Vol. 49, No. 4 (JANUARY 25, 2014)||notes||Jammu and Kashmir: A Confederate within a Federal System||IRFAN RASOOL||A constitution is the legally permitted matrix for exercise of power and access to power. The Constitution of India is a federal constitution that establishes a dual polity, which consists of the union at the centre and the states at the periphery, each endowed with sovereign powers assigned to them by the Constitution. Jammu and Kashmir, however, stands out as the only state in the Indian union that is not governed by the general scheme of distribution of powers. A special departure was made, defining what powers ought to belong to which government, which perhaps leans towards a more confederal than federal arrangement.

However, the post-neonatal deaths have declined faster than the neonatal deaths despite the emphasis on preventing the latter in the health mission. Apart from a number of reasons, this is linked to the poor quality of the public health services in general, and the undernourishment and anaemia levels of pregnant women in particular.

First, why does the state constitute these bodies if there is lack of commitment to ensure their effective functioning? Second, how significant are the recent strides made in legislation on child rights if the institutions meant to implement and monitor them are not in place?

The shift from the useful heat value (seven-grade system) to the gross calorific value (17-grade system) seems to be better for consumers of coal as the pricing is more specific to their energy requirements. Further, the new system of grading coal is closer to the standard that is followed internationally, which provides some parity in coal pricing.

The rhetoric about poverty, low educational levels and the non-implementation of the recommendations of the Sachar Committee report converge largely on the demand for a religion-based reservation in education and employment. However, it is the low level of participation rather than the low success ratio of Muslim candidates that is the root cause of the low representation.

Its visuals communicate a lot through sound and, above all, smell of food, of infidelity, of senility, and so forth. It becomes a container of a variety of expressions: affection, anger, riposte and rapprochement. It is a film exploring issues like the pathological side of conjugal relationships in a patriarchal family with great subtlety and optimism.

The Constitution and various judgments of the Supreme Court are quite clear that Parliament has the unequivocal power in deciding matters relating to reorganisation of the states. Any debate regarding the constitutional provisions is more in the realm of politics than about any interpretation of the Constitution.

On the other hand, in the Naroda Patiya judgment in the case of the rapes and murders of Muslims in this part of Gujarat, the court held that it cannot go down the route of giving the death penalty but preferred a graded system of life imprisonment based upon the degree of culpability of the different offenders. The latter is a new way of thinking about the logic of punishment. Justice Jyotsna Yagnik rejects the retributive logic and forces us to explore deeper questions about unthinkable violence, responsibility and punishment.
Vol. 49, No. 3 (JANUARY 18, 2014)||special article||Reading the Tea Leaves on Financial Inclusion: The Case of Rural Labour Households||S CHANDRASEKHAR||Understanding the extent of financial inclusion of rural labour households is important since in the intercensal period 2001-11, the proportion of agricultural labourers in the workforce increased by 3.5 percentage points. This paper examines progress in financial inclusion using information on indebtedness of rural labour households collected by the National Sample Survey Office as part of the surveys of employment and unemployment conducted in 2004-05 and 2009-10. It is estimated that 22.3 million out of the nearly 66 million rural labour households report being in debt in 2009-10. The share of formal institutions in the outstanding debt of rural labour households increased from 29% to 37% while the share of moneylenders decreased from 44% to 33% during this period. What is promising is that the reliance on institutional sources among rural labour households without cultivable land increased from 20.6% to 26%. The aggregate picture however masks large variations across the states and one does not observe any structural change in geographical distribution of flow of credit and share of outstanding advances to the landless.

Muslims are grateful for jobs and businesses that take advantage of their skills, time, labour and assets and other supposed integrative advantages that this relationship brings with it. These neighbourhoods in Delhi are integrated in the city economy, and even global economy, but only so far as the balance of accumulation of capital is tipped in favour of spaces elsewhere.
Vol. 49, No. 3 (JANUARY 18, 2014)||special article||Himachal Pradesh as "Dev Bhumi": Sociological Paradoxes||ARVIND SEHGAL||Local deities, the Devis and Devatas, in Himachal Pradesh remain powerful institutions regulating religious life; they also reinforce the traditional social order of caste and the associated values of hierarchy, including the practice of untouchability. The continuing hold of traditional religion and caste keeps the local-level communities well integrated. But this social cohesion, produced through the divinity of raja and the local devi/devatas, is also exclusionary in nature. However, there are also occasions when these traditional institutions are mobilised for "inclusion" of some kind. The local devi/devatas are sometimes used as channels by the local communities to articulate their opposition to "externally imposed" developmental projects.
Vol. 49, No. 3 (JANUARY 18, 2014)||notes||FDI in India: Ideas, Interests and Institutional Changes||SOJIN SHIN||This article examines the pattern of foreign direct investment inflows in India through three periods: (1) 1969-75, when the policy regime was "anti-FDI", (2) 1975-91, when promotion of FDI was "selective", and (3) after 1991, when the policy regime is "Pro-FDI". It shows how the ideas and interests of different political groups have affected the institutional changes that have influenced fdi inflows. It also suggests that competition between provincial states has positively contributed to the growth of fdi inflows since the economic reforms of 1991.

An unusual pattern of two-way flows in gold, diamonds and jewellery seems to underlie the boom in bilateral trade. There is reason to suspect that some of this trade involves round tripping of merchandise and to that extent the volume of India-UAE trade may be artificially inflated.

Yet the fact that there exists something so important, but so little understood or studied, is a cause for cautious optimism because it finally frees the study of Arab politics from the clutches of the two equally pretentious paradigms of "democratisation" and "post-democratisation".
Vol. 49, No. 2 (JANUARY 11, 2014)||commentary||Poverty-Hunger Divergence in India||DEEPANKAR BASU and DEBARSHI DAS||The usual explanations for the divergence between calorie intake and consumption expenditure in India ignore the enormous squeeze on food budgets arising from dispossession (leading to loss of access to common property resources), rising migration (involving a loss of access to non-market food items) and the forced turn to the private sector for social sector services that are more expensive than public sector provision. It is the resulting squeeze on food budgets that has led to calorie intake declining even as per capita consumption expenditure has risen.

Resurvey of Two Villages in Bangladesh||MAUSUMI MAHAPATRO and MAHBUB ULLAH||This paper aims to contribute to the scholarship on political economy of agrarian change by way of providing context-specific evidence and insight into agrarian transition within two selected villages in Bangladesh. As such, it discloses the findings of a resurvey assessing changes in cultivable landholdings spanning nearly 30 years. The debate over the relevance of persistence of the farmer within the backdrop of agrarian change is examined. The paper argues that the absence of a capitalist agrarian transition in Bangladesh is rooted in part in the absence of concentration in landholdings.
Vol. 49, No. 2 (JANUARY 11, 2014)||special article||Contingent Caste Endogamy and Patriarchy: Lessons for Our Understanding of Caste||JANAKI ABRAHAM||While endogamy is critical to caste and the reproduction of caste, the shifting circle of endogamy is instructive of how castes and their practices are dynamic. Insufficient attention has been paid to shifts in the enforcement of endogamy and the ways in which women's sexuality is controlled. These have varied not only by caste, but also over time and context. This paper argues that shifts in the assertion of endogamy vary according to a caste's consciousness and its aspirations at a particular historical moment. Further, in looking at varied responses to non-endogamous relationships and marriages, especially the tolerance to them in some instances, it explores the contingencies in the response. This shows that the idea of the "purity of the caste" masks forms of power often played out in the local – in the domestic, the village, or caste.

This paper undertakes a systematic review of the evidence to consider how demand-side financing has been used and whether there has been any impact on maternal health service utilisation, maternal health, or other outcomes. The findings suggest that a relatively narrow focus on achieving targets has often overburdened health facilities, while inadequate referral systems and unethical practices present overwhelming barriers for women with obstetric complications. The limited evidence available also suggests that little has been done to challenge the low status of poor women at home and in the health system.

However, in a diverse and pluralist country, it is difficult to determine which healing practices constitute "superstition" and which are genuine. Further, the rationalist movement fails to distinguish adequately between faith and blind faith often seeing the opposition between science and religion in either/or terms. In this rationalist world view, there is little space for the mystical, spiritual, or even the cultural and symbolic.

The concern is that the changes militate against the interests of regional and rural aspirants and need to be balanced against the dysfunction likely to result from the selection of candidates without skill sets for new public management. An additional worry is the rush to reform without affording much time for aspirants to adjust their exam-taking strategies.

The children develop "friendships" with complete strangers which influence their lifestyles and decision-making processes. Interestingly, they are more comfortable seeking the protection of drug dealers and family members who live on the street than of the police and NGO workers.

The analysis reveals that the categorisation of tariff lines under six different groups is the most crucial component governing tariff policy and the implementation period. India's negative balance of trade in rubber and rubber products with ASEAN and the high annual average growth rate of imports of finished rubber products underline the need for close monitoring of the trends in external trade with the trading bloc at the disaggregate level.

Based on publicly available data of over 62,800 candidates, who contested national and state assembly elections from 2004 to 2013, it shows that both crime and money play an important role in winning elections. The article ends with some tentative recommendations for improving the situation; the recommendations include legal and administrative changes, and the role that civil society and voters can play. A long public debate and discussion is needed to try and evolve a reasonable consensus.

This paper reviews the ecosystem services provided by casuarina in Australia and finds no mention that coastal protection has been the primay role of this species. The data from the "super cyclone" of October 1999 that devastated 12 districts of Odisha is compared with the storm protection afforded by other native species such as mangroves and mixed cashew nut forests found along the coast. It is seen that while native vegetation provided storm protection and saved human lives, casuarina did not have such an impact. The findings question the policy of planting casuarina as storm buffers in all cyclone-prone areas irrespective of the topography.

It discusses the sociopolitical contexts in which multilingualism, language endangerment, and linguistic justice are constituted as subjects of political philosophy and looks into the postulated correlation of linguistic diversity with human development. No significant correlation of human development with language diversity is observed at the global level, but a fuzzy correlation is found in south Asia. Four normative statements are derived and negotiated with political philosophy to rationalise the discourse on language endangerment in south Asia. Based on this, the paper points out that development with diversity has to be the political philosophy of this region.

Most of these measures are used for trend comparisons as they do not reflect actual levels of capacity utilisation. This paper proposes using the audited annual accounts of companies for an alternative method of estimating capacity utilisation for the manufacturing sector at the overall and industry levels. The proposed capacity utilisation index provides an annual estimate of the actual level of capacity utilisation, which captures the economic cycle well. It can be used for cross validation and benchmarking against other estimates of capacity utilisation. A time series of this measure of capacity utilisation will also be useful in macroeconomic analysis.
