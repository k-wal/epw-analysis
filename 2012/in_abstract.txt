AnRak Aluminium, a company of the government of Ras al-Khaimah of the United Arab Emirates and Penna Cement of ap has secured approval for both an aluminium complex and the bauxite mines, but the final forest clearance for the mines is awaited. The AnRak project has replicated the Vedanta model of first building the refinery and then setting up the mine. The mine is to be operated by the state government to circumvent the ban on non-tribal landownership. In fact, the state government has disregarded the huge environmental and social impact and popular protests against mining bauxite in the Jerrela Hills, inhabited almost exclusively by adivasi tribes who will be displaced, to safeguard private gain.

This will help devise better vocabularies and strategies for a livelihoods-based approach to ecological conservation as opposed to an accumulation-based one.
Vol. 47, No. 42 (OCTOBER 20, 2012)||commentary||Delhi's Waste Conflict||SETH SCHINDLER, FEDERICO DEMARIA and SHASHI B PANDIT||There has been an increased role for the private sector in the various stages of waste management in cities. Delhi has been at the forefront of this shift and this has brought out conflicts over collection and disposal. This article argues that the informal sector should be meaningfully incorporated into an efficient and equitable waste management system that is also environmentally sustainable.
Vol. 47, No. 41 (OCTOBER 13, 2012)||commentary||The Historical Geography of the Assam Violence||ARUPJYOTI SAIKIA||The violence in western Assam where armed groups attacked Bengali-speaking Muslims and Bodos needs to be understood in the context of long-term processes of ecological, economic and social change within the larger framework of colonialism and the modern state. Unless the state and its institutions recognise these interconnected linkages, the conflict will keep recurring, like it has for the past many decades.
Vol. 47, No. 32 (AUGUST 11, 2012)||from the states||Renuka Dam: The Saga Continues||MANSHI ASHER||Touted as the panacea for Delhi's drinking water problem, this dam can only be constructed by breaking a host of forest and environmental laws and riding roughshod over the livelihoods of farmers in about 30 villages of Himachal Pradesh.
Vol. 47, No. 30 (JULY 28, 2012)||perspectives||Theories of Oppression and Another Dialogue of Cultures||ASHIS NANDY||One of the first tasks of social knowledge in India today is to return agency to the communities at the receiving end of the system. We can do so only if we take seriously the various cultural modes of self-expression of these communities. Democracy can be a slow-moving, inept, obtuse tool in the case of small communities. But it still remains a powerful enabling device for those not pushed to the margin of desperation. Instead of shedding copious tears for the poverty and the exploitation of the dalits and adivasis, the time has come to celebrate their self-affirmation and the enormous diversity of cultural, ecological, artistic, technological and intellectual riches they, as communities, have nurtured over the millennia.
Vol. 47, No. 29 (JULY 21, 2012)||commentary||Soil Health and Support Systems: Contradictions and Missing Links||S R GOPIKRISHNA||The soil as a natural resource has always been taken for granted by policymakers. While the government investments continue to support chemical fertiliser-based farming models, this article explores the contradictions in soil health management policies and their impact on farming and food production. It argues that it is high time that the government chalks out a plan to move away from dependence on chemical fertilisers to ensure food security in the country and makes investments to support an holistic ecological fertilisation programme.

But the summit was not a failure that many have portrayed it to be. An analysis of the main outcomes. especially of the new "sustainable development goals", brings out the complex nature of the outcome and the challenges in the follow-up.
Vol. 47, No. 28 (JULY 14, 2012)||commentary||Holding Back the 'Green Economy' Idea, But for How Long?||T JAYARAMAN||The agenda of the developed countries at Rio+2o was to confront the issue of sustainability strictly within the scope of the dominant paradigms on how to manage economies. In the end, the developing countries had some cause for satisfaction at the outcome of Rio+2o since some of their core concerns were included in the final document. However, the global South lacks as yet the knowledge capabilities required to counter the flood of Northern scholarship that is now directed towards establishing an architecture of global environmental governance that would preserve the current pattern of global economic dominance and significantly shift the burden of sustainability onto the developing world.
Vol. 47, No. 25 (JUNE 23, 2012)||commentary||E-Waste Law: New Paradigm or Business as Usual?||RAVI AGARWAL||The new e-waste rules notified by the government are an important step forward. However, loopholes which allow producers to evade their responsibility and the informal sector to evade environmental and health controls need to be addressed. It is also important to create mass awareness and make it easier for the consumer to dispose e-waste. Policy should encourage cooperation rather than competition between those responsible for disposing e-waste.
Vol. 47, No. 23 (JUNE 9, 2012)||commentary||Rio+20: What Is at Stake||T JAYARAMAN, DIVYA SINGH KOHLI and SHRUTI MITTAL||There are major issues at stake in the Rio+20 Summit on Sustainable Development to be held on 20-22 June. Yet governments of developing countries have not given adequate importance to the run-up to the conference. As has happened in the climate change negotiations, the outcome draft now under negotiation shows a concerted move to rewrite the terms of global environmental governance. There is an attempt to push through the decidedly narrow and environmentally defined "green economy" and there are moves to dilute the importance of development for poverty eradication. Backed by an arsenal of research on environmental economics, the North is out to set a policy agenda that the South is finding it difficult to catch up with.
Vol. 47, No. 23 (JUNE 9, 2012)||special articles||Dalits and Indian Environmental Politics||MUKUL SHARMA||Indian environmental paradigms and politics, frequently conceptualised and expressed in terms of India's glorious past, often render questions of caste and dalits invisible. However, it needs to be recognised that caste is one of the central categories that frames environmental politics. Dalit thinkers, organisations and movements have had a wider perspective and critique of environmental articulations that require deeper investigation. On the one hand, we see a caste-blindness in current environmental politics. On the other, we see dalit views on Indian environmentalism, reflected in their works, words and movements in different parts of the country. This brings forth not only new dimensions on both environment and dalits, but also helps us in redefining certain key categories such as development, modernity, community, livelihood and social movements.
Vol. 47, No. 18 (MAY 5, 2012)||commentary||The Emerging Environmental Burden from Pharmaceuticals||GEETHA MATHEW and M K UNNIKRISHNAN||The enormity of pollution due to pharmaceuticals in India has caught the attention of researchers all over the world. This was due to the near extinction of vultures in the Indian subcontinent in the 1990s caused by diclofenac and a recent study in 2007 by Swedish scientists on pharmaceutical effluents in Patancheru in Hyderabad. The massive outsourcing of pharmaceutical production by the west has made third world nations like India a victim of unbridled opportunism. As the west wakes up to the environmental implications of "pharma pollution", Sweden's Medical Products Agency recommends a reduction in outsourcing and revisions in pharma manufacturing practices. Would these exhortations reduce pharmaceutical pollution in India or would they adversely impact India's advantages in the global drug market?

In the process he touched the lives of countless people who rated his friendship as a blessing. This is an account from one such admirer and friend.
Vol. 47, No. 16 (APRIL 21, 2012)||river interlinking||Teesta, Tipaimukh and River Linking: Danger to Bangladesh-India Relations||IMTIAZ AHMED||The Supreme Court's verdict directing the Government of India to implement the interlinking of rivers seems to have overlooked the regional and international implications of what the Indian Court strangely considers "the rivers of the country". Just Bangladesh shares 54 rivers with India. Any unilateral action by India on any of its international rivers will degrade its relations with its neighbours while also adversely affecting its ecology, economy and society.
Vol. 47, No. 15 (APRIL 14, 2012)||commentary||The Nature of Green Justice||KANCHI KOHLI and MANJU MENON||The National Green Tribunal has taken over from the National Environment Appellate Authority though the changeover has not been smooth. The tribunal has significant powers and its rulings will affect the lives and livelihoods of communities as well as the future of ecologically fragile ecosystems. A look at the factors and issues it will have to consider while rendering environmental justice.
Vol. 47, No. 13 (MARCH 31, 2012)||special articles||The Commons, Communities and Climate Change||NARPAT S JODHA, NAVEEN P SINGH and CYNTHIA S BANTILAN||Rural common property resources represent the historically evolved institutional arrangements made by communities in dry regions (in the present case) to guard against the vulnerabilities and risks created by the biophysical and environmental circumstances characteristic of these areas. Despite their valuable contributions, CPRs are faced with decline in terms of both extent as well as contribution to the people, and therefore consequent neglect by the communities. This paper looks into the process of this negative change, and attributes the same to public policies, market forces and population growth (accentuating land hunger) along with the disintegration of traditional collective approaches of communities to maintain CPRs as community assets.
Vol. 47, No. 7 (FEBRUARY 18 2012)||commentary||Critiquing Landscape Urbanism: A View on New York's High Line||LEON A MORENAS||Given the growing interest in landscape urbanism in Indian architectural discourse, this article critically examines the history and impact of its most prominent embodiment, New York's High Line public park. Landscape urbanism has not contributed to social justice, political emancipation, or ecologically saner designs, as its proponents have argued. Instead, while small privately developed parks like the High Line have cornered most resources flowing to New York's parklands, far larger parks in poorer areas face a decline due to dwindling public investment.
Vol. 47, No. 6 (FEBRUARY 11, 2012)||commentary||Developmental Crisis and Dialectics of Protest Politics: Presenting the Absent and Absenting the Present||RAJU J DAS||There is not just a crisis of development today, but also a crisis of ideas for emancipatory forms of development. What is needed from progressives is a rigorous theory that must acknowledge what is present (class exploitation, imperialism, national and social oppression, profit-driven ecological destruction, gross commercialisation of all spheres of human life including culture and social relations) but also what is absent (collective democratic control over our lives, our planet, our bodies, our destiny, our culture). That should be the start of the process of bringing about fundamental changes in the status quo.
